0,"The report concludes by discussing trends with regard to the House's recent CAS practices and by providing considerations for congressional personnel drafting CASs. The report contains two tables: Table 1 identifies the constitutional provisions most commonly cited in CASs during the last six months of the 114 th and 115 th Congresses, and Table 2 lists suggested constitutional authorities for various types of legislation.
Specifically, that clause provides Congress with the power to make ""all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof."" The Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of Congress's power under the Necessary and Proper Clause as ""broad,"" in that the clause leaves to ""Congress a large discretion as to the means that may be employed in executing a given power."" In so holding, the Court has described the clause as providing the ""broad power to enact laws that are 'convenient, or useful' or 'conducive' to"" a more specific authority's ""beneficial exercise."" Consistent with this view, the Court has upheld legislation criminalizing perjury and witness tampering as an extension of Congress's power to constitute federal tribunals.
For instance, the Supreme Court has identified federalism-based constraints stemming from the Tenth Amendment—the provision of the Bill of Rights that reads, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."" More specifically, the Court has interpreted the Tenth Amendment to prevent the federal government from ""commandeering"" or requiring state executive officers or state legislators to carry out federal directives.
Among the most prominent examples of CASs that could be seen as adopting an interpretation of the Constitution that potentially diverges from historical understandings or judicial interpretations of a particular clause include statements that cite to the following clauses: Necessary and Proper Clause : One of the most frequently cited clauses in recent CASs was the Necessary and Proper Clause, which allows Congress to ""make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution"" the powers enumerated in Article I and ""all other Powers vested by [the] Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof."" About a quarter of all CASs in the CRS studies contained a citation to that clause, with 14% of the 2016 CASs and 19% of the 2018 CASs citing the Necessary and Proper Clause as the sole power to enact the underlying legislation."
1,"In his veto message, President Nixon said the Resolution would impose restrictions upon the authority of the President which would be dangerous to the safety of the Nation and ""attempt to take away, by a mere legislative act, authorities which the President has properly exercised under the Constitution for almost 200 years."" The War Powers Resolution in Section 2(c) recognized the constitutional powers of the President as Commander in Chief to introduce forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities as ""exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces."" The executive branch has contended that the President has much broader authority to use forces, including for such purposes as to rescue American citizens abroad, rescue foreign nationals where such action facilitates the rescue of U.S. citizens, protect U.S. Embassies and legations, suppress civil insurrection, implement the terms of an armistice or cease-fire involving the United States, and carry out the terms of security commitments contained in treaties.
The measure, which became law, provided that any joint resolution or bill to require the removal of U.S. Armed Forces engaged in hostilities outside the United States without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization would be considered in accordance with the expedited procedures of Section 601(b) of the International Security and Arms Export Control Act of 1976, except that it would be amendable and debate on a veto limited to 20 hours.
Neither approach was adopted in legislation, but the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported that the President had ""a clear obligation under the War Powers Resolution to consult with Congress prior to any future decision to commit combat forces to El Salvador."" On July 26, 1983, the House rejected an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill ( H.R. 2969 ) to limit the number of active duty military advisers in El Salvador to 55, unless the President reported any increase above that level under Section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution.
The House Appropriations Committee approved an amendment to the continuing resolution for FY1984 ( H.J.Res. 367 ), sponsored by Representative Clarence Long, providing that after 60 days, funds could not be ""obligated or expended for peacekeeping activities in Lebanon by United States Armed Forces,"" unless the President had submitted a report under Section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution.
The Defense Authorization Act for FY1994 required a report to Congress by April 1, 1994, including discussion of the requirement of congressional approval for participation of U.S. Armed Forces in multinational peacekeeping missions, proposals to conclude military agreements with the U.N. Security Council under Article 43 of the U.N. Charter, and the applicability of the War Powers Resolution and the U.N. Participation Act. In 1994 and 1995, Congress attempted to gain a greater role in U.N. and other peacekeeping operations through authorization and appropriation legislation.
On October 2, 1990, the Senate by a vote of 96-3 adopted S.Con.Res. 147 , stating that ""Congress supports continued action by the President in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations Security Council and in accordance with United States constitutional and statutory processes, including the authorization and appropriation of funds by the Congress, to deter Iraqi aggression and to protect American lives and vital interest in the region."" As in the House, Senate leaders emphasized that the resolution was not to be interpreted as an open-ended resolution similar to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution.
In his statement made after signing H.J.Res. 77 into law, President Bush said the following: ""As I made clear to congressional leaders at the outset, my request for congressional support did not, and my signing this resolution does not, constitute any change in the long-standing positions of the executive branch on either the President's constitutional authority to use the Armed Forces to defend vital U.S. interests or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution."" He added that he was pleased that ""differences on these issues between the President and many in the Congress have not prevented us from uniting in a common objective."" On January 16, President Bush made the determination required by P.L. 102-1 that diplomatic means had not and would not compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
On June 24, 1998, the House passed H.R. 4103 , the Defense Department Appropriations bill for FY1999, with a provision by Representative David Skaggs that banned the use of funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act ""to initiate or conduct offensive military operations by United States Armed Forces except in accordance with the war powers clause of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 8), which vests in Congress the power to declare and authorize war and to take certain specified, related actions."" The Skaggs provision was stricken by the House-Senate conference committee on H.R. 4103 .
On March 31, 1993, the U.N. Security Council authorized member states to take all necessary measures to enforce the ban on military flights over Bosnia, the ""no-fly zone."" NATO planes, including U.S. planes, began patrolling over Bosnia and Herzegovina on April 12, 1993, to enforce the Security Council ban, and the next day, President Clinton reported the U.S. participation ""consistent with Section 4 of the War Powers Resolution."" Conflict continued, but the situation was complicated and opinion in Congress and among U.N. and NATO members was divided.
On September 1, 1995, President Clinton reported ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" that ""U.S. combat and support aircraft"" had been used beginning on August 29, 1995, in a series of NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina that were threatening the U.N.-declared safe areas of Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Gorazde."" He noted that during the first day of operations, ""some 300 sorties were flown against 23 targets in the vicinity of Sarajevo, Tuzla, Gorazde, and Mostar."" On September 7, 1995, the House passed an amendment to the FY1996 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill ( H.R. 2126 ), offered by Representative Mark Neumann that prohibited the obligation or expenditure of funds provided by the bill for any operations beyond those already undertaken.
Subsequently, on October 30, 1995, the House, by a vote of 315-103, passed H.Res. 247 , expressing the sense of the House that ""no United States Armed forces should be deployed on the ground in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to enforce a peace agreement until the Congress has approved such a deployment."" On November 13, President Clinton's 9-page letter to Speaker Gingrich stated he would send a request ""for a congressional expression of support for U.S. participation in a NATO-led Implementation Force in Bosnia ...
On June 12, 1999, President Clinton announced and reported to Congress ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution"" that he had directed the deployment of about ""7,000 U.S. military personnel as the U.S. contribution to the approximately 50,000-member, NATO-led security force (KFOR)"" being assembled in Kosovo.
On September 24, 2001, President Bush reported to Congress, ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" and ""Senate Joint Resolution 23"" that in response to terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon he had ordered the ""deployment of various combat-equipped and combat support forces to a number of foreign nations in the Central and Pacific Command areas of operations."" The President noted that as part of efforts to ""prevent and deter terrorism"" he might find it necessary to order additional forces into these and other areas of the world...."" He stated that he could not now predict ""the scope and duration of these deployments,"" nor the ""actions necessary to counter the terrorist threat to the United States."" Subsequently, on October 9, 2001, President George W.
In his War Powers Resolution report to Congress, on June 15, 2012, the President noted that he had authorized, during the previous six months, the U.S. military to work closely with the government of Yemen ""to operationally dismantle and ultimately eliminate the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the most active and dangerous affiliate of al-Qa'ida today."" The President added that Our joint efforts have resulted in direct action against a limited number of AQAP operatives and senior leaders in that country who posed a terrorist threat to the United States and our interests.
Providing an explanation of applicable constitutional and/or legislative authority, President Obama stated that he had directed the deployment ""pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive."" Subsequent notifications updating Congress on the status of U.S. Armed Forces in Niger have been included regularly in the six-month periodic reports under the War Powers Resolution, reflecting an increase of total numbers of troops from approximately 40 in early 2013 to approximately 800 as of the June 2018 notification.
On December 21, 1995, President Clinton notified Congress ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution"" that he had ordered the deployment of approximately 20,000 U.S. military personnel to participate in the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and approximately 5,000 U.S. military personnel would be deployed in other former Yugoslav states, primarily in Croatia.
On December 21, 1995, President Clinton notified Congress ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution"" that he had ordered the deployment of approximately 20,000 U.S. military personnel to participate in the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and approximately 5,000 U.S. military personnel would be deployed in other former Yugoslav states, primarily in Croatia.
On January 19, 1999, by letter, President Clinton notified Congress ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution"" that pursuant to his authority as Commander in Chief he was continuing to authorize the use of combat-equipped U.S. Armed Forces to Bosnia and other states in the region to participate in and support the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR).
On June 12, 1999, President Clinton reported to Congress, ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" that he had directed the deployment of about ""7,000 U.S. military personnel as the U.S. contribution to the approximately 50,000-member, NATO-led security force (KFOR)"" being assembled in Kosovo.
On December 15, 1999, President Clinton reported to Congress ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution"" that U.S. combat-equipped military personnel continued to serve as part of the NATO-led security force in Kosovo (KFOR).
On June 16, 2000, President Clinton reported to Congress, ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" that the U.S. was continuing to provide military personnel to the NATO-led KFOR security force in Kosovo.
On July 25, 2000, President Clinton reported to Congress, ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" that combat-equipped U.S. military personnel continued to participate in the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, being deployed to Bosnia, and other states in the region in support of peacekeeping efforts in former Yugoslavia.
On December 18, 2000, President Clinton reported to Congress, ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" that the United States was continuing to provide approximately 5,600 U.S. military personnel in support of peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo as part of the NATO-led international security force in Kosovo (KFOR).
Bush reported to Congress, ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" and ""Senate Joint Resolution 23"" that on October 7, 2001, U.S. Armed Forces ""began combat action in Afghanistan against Al Qaida terrorists and their Taliban supporters."" The President stated that he had directed this military action in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks on U.S.

2,"Members of the minority stated, in the Ways and Means Committee's report to the House, that the old-age benefits program (Title II) and the method by which the money was to be raised to pay for the program (Title VIII) established a ""bureaucracy in the field of insurance in competition with private business."" They contended further that the program would ""destroy old-age retirement systems set up by private industries, which in most instances provide more liberal benefits than are contemplated under Title II."" Although some party members tried to remove the old-age benefits provisions, the majority of Republicans in both chambers nevertheless did vote for the final Social Security bill.
House Action On June 2, 1939, following public hearings on the proposed amendments and six weeks of executive sessions, the Committee on Ways and Means reported to the House H.R. 6635, embodying its recommendations for amendments to the Social Security Act. The day before, the House had debated on and voted against the Townsend old-age pension bill.
The minority stated in the committee's report to the House that ""while the bill in no sense represents a complete or satisfactory solution of the problem of Social Security, it at least makes certain improvements in the present law (some of which we have ourselves heretofore suggested) which we believe justify us in supporting it despite its defects."" On June 9, 1939, Representative Havenner (D-CA) offered an amendment, endorsed by the American Federation of Labor, to extend Social Security coverage to workers employed in college clubs or fraternities or sororities; employees in nonprofit religious, charitable, or educational institutions; student nurses; and some agricultural workers.
In a 1942 letter to the Senate Finance Committee, President Roosevelt said that ""a failure to allow the scheduled increase in rates to take place under the present favorable circumstances would cause a real and justifiable fear that adequate funds will not be accumulated to meet the heavy obligations of the future and that the claims for benefits accruing under the present law may be jeopardized."" He also stated that ""expanded Social Security, together with other fiscal measures, would set up a bulwark of economic security for the people now and after the war and at the same time would provide anti-inflationary sources for financing the war."" Members who were opposed to the freeze argued that the scheduled payroll tax increase was important for the long-term soundness of the OASI trust fund and that postponing the tax increase would mean higher payroll tax rates in the future and perhaps government subsidies to meet obligations.
The amendments increased OASI benefits for both present and future recipients (by an average of 15% for those on the rolls), permitted recipients to earn $75 a month (instead of $50) without losing OASI benefits, extended wage credits of $160 for each month in which active military or naval service was performed during the period from July 24, 1947, through December 1953, and provided for a disability ""freeze,"" which in principle preserved the Social Security benefits of qualified workers who became permanently and totally disabled before retirement by averaging the person's wages only over his or her working years.
Among the amendments adopted on the floor by the Senate was a provision by Senator Long (D-LA) to require the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to study the feasibility and costs of providing increased minimum benefits of $55, $60, and $75 a month under the Social Security program.
Senate Action At Senate Finance Committee hearings on the House-passed bill, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Marion Folsom stated that the Administration was opposed to reducing the retirement age to 62 for women and providing disability benefits.
On June 5, 1956, the Senate Finance Committee reported H.R. 7225 after eliminating the Disability Insurance program and the tax increase to pay for it and limiting retirement benefits at age 62 to widows only.
Conference Action The conferees agreed to the medical care provisions in the Senate-passed bill (i.e., no new title for a program for aged persons not eligible for OAA benefits).
The proposed Social Security Amendments of 1964 as passed by the House contained a 5% across-the-board Social Security benefit increase; extended the child's benefit to age 22 if he or she were in school; allowed widows to retire at age 60, with actuarially reduced benefits; provided limited benefits to persons aged 72 or older who had some Social Security coverage but not enough to meet the minimum requirements of existing law; and extended Social Security coverage to groups of persons who previously had been excluded.
The proposed Social Security Amendments of 1964 as passed by the Senate contained a hospital insurance program, the so-called King-Anderson bill; increased benefits: raised the earnings base; liberalized the earnings test; changed the eligibility requirements for the blind; and permitted religious groups to reject Social Security coverage if they had religious objections to social insurance.
Although a federally operated health insurance program covering the entire nation was considered by the Franklin Roosevelt Administration in 1935, it was not explicitly endorsed until January 1945, when President Roosevelt's budget message called for an ""extended Social Security including medical care."" Such a plan was submitted to Congress by President Truman in November 1945, but neither chamber acted on the proposal, in large part due to strong opposition by the AMA.
On July 7, 1965, Senator Byrd's (D-WV) amendment to lower the age at which workers could receive Social Security benefits to 60 (rather than age 62, the existing minimum) was agreed to by voice vote.
On July 9, 1965, Senator Hartke's (D-IN) amendment to liberalize the definition of blindness under the Social Security program, provide benefits to blind workers with at least 6 quarters of Social Security coverage, and permit blind workers to receive benefits regardless of other earnings was passed by a vote of 78 (28-R, 50-D) to 11 (11-D).
President Johnson had called for a 15% across-the-board increase in OASDI benefits and numerous other changes in the Social Security Act. The proposals were embodied in H.R. 5710, introduced in the House on February 20, 1967, by the Committee on Ways and Means chairman, Wilbur Mills (D-AR).
Senator Long (D-LA), chairman of the Finance Committee and floor manager of H.R. 4690, said that he had asked the House to take immediate action to raise Social Security benefits and as the House had not responded, he was offering a benefit increase as an amendment to H.R. 4690, a bill to increase the debt ceiling.
On March 12, 1971, Senator Long's amendment to provide a 10% increase in Social Security payments, a $100 minimum monthly benefit, increases in earnings limitations, and other changes passed by a vote of 82 (38-R, 44-D) to 0.
The Senate, on March 12, 1971, passed H.R. 4690, after approving several Social Security changes, including the benefit increase proposed by Senator Long, by a vote of 80 (37-R, 43-D) to 0.
On June 30, 1972, Representative Mills's (D-AR) motion that the House concur with the Senate-passed amendment granting a 20% Social Security benefit increase and annual automatic cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) was accepted by a vote of 302 (108-R, 194-D) to 35 (28-R, 7-D).
On September 28, 1972, Senator Percy's (R-IL) amendment to require the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to review the Social Security earnings test, and report to Congress on the feasibility of eliminating it, was accepted by voice vote.
n September 29, 1972, the Finance Committee's amendment to guarantee every person who worked in employment covered under the Social Security program for at least 30 years a minimum monthly benefit of $200 ($300 for a couple) passed by a vote of 73 (30-R, 43-D) to 0.
Senate Action The Senate Finance Committee approved a number of provisions affecting Social Security, including an initial 7% benefit increase effective upon enactment and a further 4% increase in June 1974.
On October 15, 1981, Senator Dole's (R-KS) amendment to apply the Social Security payroll tax to the first six months of all employer-financed sick pay, except that paid as insurance, was accepted by voice vote.
Conforming to most of the recommendations in the commission's package, the 1983 amendments put new federal employees and all nonprofit organization employees under the OASDI program as of January 1, 1984; prohibited state and local and nonprofit agencies from terminating Social Security coverage; moved the annual cost-of-living adjustments in benefits from July to January of each year (which caused a delay of six months in 1983); made up to one-half of the benefits received by higher income recipients subject to federal income taxation; gradually raised the full benefit retirement age from 65 to 67 early in the 21 st century; increased benefits for certain groups of widow(er)s; liberalized the earnings test; increased the delayed retirement credit; reduced benefits for workers also getting pensions based on noncovered employment; called for the earlier implementation of scheduled payroll tax increases; and substantially raised payroll tax rates on the self-employed.
Senate Action When the Finance Committee approved H.R. 3545 on December 3, 1987, it included the House Social Security coverage provisions.
Among its Social Security provisions, it made permanent a temporary provision, first enacted in 1984 and subsequently extended, that provides the option for recipients to choose to continue to receive disability and Medicare benefits while their termination is being appealed; liberalized the definition of disability for disabled widow(er)s by making it consistent with that for disabled workers; extended benefits to spouses whose marriage to the worker is otherwise invalid, if the spouse was living with the worker before he or she died or filed for benefits; removed the operation of the trust funds from budget deficit calculations under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act; established separate House and Senate procedural safeguards to protect trust fund balances; extended coverage to employees of state and local governments who are not covered by a retirement plan; and raised the maximum amount of earnings subject to HI taxes to $125,000, effective in 1991, with raises thereafter indexed to increases in average wages."
3,"Introduction The Federal Reserve's (the Fed's) responsibilities as the nation's central bank fall into four main categories: monetary policy, provision of emergency liquidity through the lender of last resort function, supervision of certain types of banks and other financial firms for safety and soundness, and provision of payment system services to financial firms and the government.
By contrast, the Fed states that ""it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."" Monetary policy can be used to stabilize business cycle fluctuations (alternating periods of economic expansions and recessions) in the short run, while it mainly affects inflation in the long run.
Recent Monetary Policy Developments In December 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis and the ""Great Recession,"" the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%.
Although monetary policy is now less stimulative than it had been at the zero lower bound, the Fed is still adding stimulus to the economy as long as the federal funds rate is below what economists call the ""neutral rate"" (or the long-run equilibrium rate).
The loans and other assistance provided by the Federal Reserve to banks and nonbank institutions are considered assets on this balance sheet because they represent money owed to the Fed. With the federal funds rate at its zero bound and direct lending falling as financial conditions began to normalize in 2009, the Fed faced the decision of whether to try to provide additional monetary stimulus through unconventional measures."
4,"The hallmarks of this framework include establishment of an independent commission whose members are appointed by the President, in consultation with congressional leadership (and the advice and consent of the Senate); reliance on objective and uniform criteria for evaluating basing recommendations; GAO review and certification of DOD data; deliberations that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; requirement that the commission's final list of closure and realignment actions be accepted or rejected in its entirety; and presidential and congressional off-ramps that would terminate the BRAC process when certain conditions are not met.
In addition to refining DOD accounting metrics, some observers have suggested congressional visibility into BRAC cost and long-term effectiveness could be improved by amending the process to require the Department to disclose how closure and realignment recommendations meet expected cost saving and reduced infrastructure targets.
In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, Lucian Niemeyer, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment, indicated DOD would be working in FY2019 to improve its excess infrastructure accounting processes and demolish unneeded infrastructure: In lieu of another request for legislation in FY 2019 to authorize an additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, we will review our facilities, to include facility usage optimization review to ensure we have a better accounting of excess infrastructure."
5,"§644(e)(1) states, ""To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by a Federal department or agency having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers."" To accomplish this goal, FAR regulations (FAR §19.202-1) require contracting officers, when applicable, to take the following actions prior to awarding a federal contract: 1.
Conduct periodic reviews of the agency's contracting activity, including the agency's assessment of any required small business subcontracting plan, ""to ascertain whether the agency is complying with the small business policies in this regulation."" Sponsor and participate in conferences and training ""designed to increase small business participation in the contracting activities of the office."" The Role of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Every federal agency (except the SBA) that has procurement powers is required to have an OSDBU, whose director, by statute, reports directly to the head of the agency and has supervisory authority over agency staff performing certain procurement functions.
Among its statutory responsibilities are the following:  ""Identify proposed solicitations that involve significant bundling of contract requirements, and work with the agency acquisition officials and the Administration to revise the procurement strategies for such proposed solicitations where appropriate to increase the probability of participation by small businesses as prime contractors, or to facilitate small business participation as subcontractors and suppliers, if a solicitation for a bundled contract is to be issued."" Assist small businesses ""to obtain payments, required late payment interest penalties, or information regarding payments due to the concern from an executive agency or a contractor."" Assign ""a small business technical adviser to each office to which the SBA has assigned"" a PCR.
Ensure that a small business that notifies the PCR prior to a contract's award that ""a solicitation, request for proposal, or request for quotation unduly restricts [its] ability … to compete for the award … is aware of other resources and processes available to address unduly restrictive provisions … even if such resources and processes are provided by such agency, the Administration, the Comptroller General, or a Department of Defense (DOD) procurement technical assistance program [described below]."" Review all subcontracting plans ""to ensure that the plan provides maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns to participate in the performance of the contract to which the plan applies."" In accordance with P.L. 109-163 , the National Defense Authorization Act of 2006, the DOD renamed its OSDBU the Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP)."
6,"For example, some contend that climate change poses a ""direct, existential threat"" to human society and that nations must start making significant reductions in GHG emissions in order to avoid ""dire effects."" To support this argument, proponents of climate change mitigation highlight the evidence and conclusions from recent reports that are generally considered authoritative, including: 1.
The third section discusses additional considerations associated with a carbon tax program, including estimates of GHG emissions, federal revenue, and fossil fuel prices and changes in energy use.
When deciding how to allocate the new revenue stream, policymakers would likely encounter trade-offs among objectives, including: reducing the economy-wide costs resulting from a carbon tax program; alleviating the costs borne by subgroups in the U.S. population, particularly low-income households and/or communities most dependent on carbon-intensive economic activity; and supporting specific policy objectives, such as domestic employment, climate change adaptation, energy efficiency, technological advance, energy diversity, or federal deficit reduction, among others.
Multiple economic studies and models have examined and compared various options for addressing the economy-wide impacts that may result from a carbon tax.
In general, the economic carbon tax studies usually agree on the relative ranking of revenue recycling options in terms of their ability to mitigate the economy-wide impacts of a carbon tax program.
Additional Considerations Impacts on GHG Emission Levels Multiple economic studies have estimated the emission reductions that particular carbon tax designs could achieve."
7,"Although other MSPB employees, including administrative judges who issue initial decisions in cases, will continue their work, some Members of Congress and others have raised concerns about the extent to which these vacancies limit the agency's ability to perform its other functions.
The Board has original jurisdiction over actions brought by the Special Counsel for corrective and disciplinary action, specified removals of persons in the Senior Executive Service (SES), and certain adverse personnel actions taken against administrative law judges (ALJs).
For employees who are neither ALJs nor members of the SES, the applicable standard is cause ""as will promote the efficiency of the service."" An ALJ who is subject to a final Board decision authorizing a proposed agency action may obtain judicial review before the Federal Circuit."
8,"An individual selected for a continuing position is generally appointed as a career-conditional employee subject to an initial one-year probationary period.
Adverse Action Protections and Procedures Employees in the competitive service who are not serving a probationary or trial period, or have completed one year of current continuous service in a position other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less, maintain specified notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions."
9,"Regular Military Compensation (RMC) RMC, as defined in law, is ""the total of the following elements that a member of the uniformed services accrues or receives, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind every payday: basic pay, basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence, and federal tax advantage accruing to the aforementioned allowances because they are not subject to federal income tax."" Though military compensation is structured much differently than civilian compensation, making comparison difficult, RMC provides a more complete understanding of the cash compensation provided to all servicemembers.
However, in the case of a downward adjustment, a ""save pay"" provision on the BAH statute prevents the decrease from applying to individuals currently assigned to that locality: ""So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing within an area of the United States, the monthly amount of the allowance for the member may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member."" Thus, only personnel newly assigned to the area receive the lower payment.
The House-passed version of the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) contained no provision to specify the rate of increase in basic pay.
Section 601 of the House-passed version of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) required the statutory formula increase (2.4%) to go into effect, ""notwithstanding any determination made by the President under subsection (e) of such section with respect to an alternative pay adjustment....
No general pay raise provision was included in the final version of the NDAA, thereby leaving in place the 1.0% increase specified by President Obama.
One common method of comparison is to calculate the cumulative difference between increases in military and civilian pay using military basic pay, a narrow measure of cash compensation that does not include, for example, tax-free allowances for housing and food.
Additionally, general increases in basic pay higher than the rate of increase in the ECI (2000-2010) and the elimination of ""out-of-pocket"" housing expenses by 2005 pushed servicemember RMC up substantially in relation to civilian compensation."
10,"But there is no doubt that the suffering resulting from the lack of reform is much worse."" The IMF has praised the Egyptian government's record of reform implementation, while also highlighting the need for private sector growth ""that will absorb the rapidly growing labor force and ensure that the benefits are perceived more widely."" After several years of observers seeing Egypt as more inwardly focused, several recent developments suggest an increasingly active foreign policy.
According to the U.S. State Department's report on human rights conditions in Egypt in 2017: The most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents; major terrorist attacks; disappearances; torture; harsh or potentially life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; including the use of military courts to try civilians; political prisoners and detainees; unlawful interference in privacy; limits on freedom of expression, including criminal ""defamation of religion"" laws; restrictions on the press, internet, and academic freedom; and restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association, including government control over registration and financing of NGOs [nongovernmental organizations].
Select international human rights, democracy, and development monitoring organizations provide the following rankings for Egypt globally: Other human rights issues of potential interest to Congress may include the 2013 convictions of American, European, and Egyptian civil society representatives; the controversial 2017 NGO law; the detention of American citizens in Egypt; and the treatment of Coptic Christians, discussed in the following sections.
According to Human Rights Watch , ""the new law allows governors to deny church-building permits with no stated way to appeal, requires that churches be built 'commensurate with' the number of Christians in the area, and contains security provisions that risk subjecting decisions on whether to allow church construction to the whims of violent mobs."" The Economy For 2019, the IMF projects 5.3% GDP growth for the Egyptian economy, noting that the outlook remains ""favorable, supported by strong policy implementation."" In 2016, the IMF and Egypt reached a three-year, $12 billion loan agreement, $10 billion of which has been disbursed as of March 2019.
The FY2019 Omnibus ( P.L. 116-6 ) provides the following for Egypt: a total of $1.419 billion in bilateral U.S. foreign assistance for Egypt, of which $1.3 billion is in FMF, $112.5 million in ESF, $3 million in NADR, $2 million in INCLE, and $1.8 million in IMET; and a reauthorization of ESF to support future loan guarantees to Egypt; P.L. 116-6 sets the following conditions for Egypt: As in previous years, it requires that funds may only be made available when the Secretary of State certifies that the government of Egypt is sustaining the strategic relationship with the United States and meeting its obligations under the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty."
11,"Introduction This report provides a comprehensive summary of the federal financial assistance provided to the Gulf Coast states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas in response to the widespread destruction that resulted from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005 and Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.
The federal government played a significant role in the response to the hurricanes and Congress appropriated funds for a wide range of activities and efforts to help the Gulf Coast states recover and rebuild from the storms.
Section I presents funding provided to the five Gulf Coast states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike. Funding amounts were compiled by CRS analysts who reviewed legislative texts of supplemental appropriations.
Section I: Summary of Gulf Coast Disaster Supplemental Appropriations   Table 1 presents data on the appropriations enacted after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike from FY2005 to FY2009, by federal entity and subentity, when possible and applicable.
Under the largest disaster program, Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program (SURE), the combined payments for Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas totaled $285 million in 2008 for a variety of natural disaster losses, including hurricane damage ( Table 4 ).
Funding Narrative  Congress did not provide EAA supplemental appropriations for disaster recovery activities related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Wilma.
Congress then appropriated an additional $15 million through P.L. 110-329 to provide support to local educational agencies (LEAs) whose enrollment of homeless students increased as a result of hurricanes, including Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, floods, or other natural disasters during 2008.
Gulf Coast Recovery Initiative P.L. 111-117 provided $12 million for competitive awards to LEAs located in counties in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas that were designated by FEMA as counties eligible for individual assistance as a result of damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Gustav.
DRF-Funded Crisis Counseling Program (CCP)  Pursuant to Section 416 of the Stafford Act, the President may provide assistance for the establishment of crisis counseling services in areas affected by declared major disasters.
Federal Assistance for Health Care  In response to Hurricane Katrina, Congress authorized and appropriated a one-time program of up to $2.1 billion to cover full federal funding of the state match that would normally have been required under the Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance (CHIP) programs, and the costs of uncompensated care, for eligible individuals from disaster-affected areas.
Program Description The primary mission of FEMA is to ""reduce the loss of life and property and protect the Nation from all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, by leading and supporting the Nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation.""  FEMA provides assistance to states, local governments, tribal nations, individuals and families, and certain nonprofit organizations through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF).
A total of $4.296 billion was awarded to five of six states included in Table 20 to support disaster recovery activities in response to Hurricane Ike. Texas accounted for 71% of the total followed by Louisiana (25%), Tennessee (2%), Florida (1.8%), and Mississippi (less than 1%).
Chapter 8 of Title I of Division B of the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 ( P.L. 109-148 ) provided $9 million for the USMS's salaries and expenses account ""to support operational recovery from hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region."" Federal Bureau of Investigation Program Authority or Authorities Subtitle A of Title XI of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-162 ) authorized $5.761 billion for FY2006, $5.992 billion for FY2007, $6.231 billion for FY2008, and $6.481 billion for FY2009 for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) account.
Chapter 8 of Title I of Division B of the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 ( P.L. 109-148 ) provided $20 million for the ATF's salaries and expenses account ""to support operational recovery from hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region."" Federal Prison System (Bureau of Prisons) Program Authority Subtitle A of Title XI of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-162 ) authorized $5.066 billion for FY2006, $5.268 billion for FY2007, $5.479 billion for FY2008, and $5.698 billion for FY2009 for the Federal Prison System account.
EPA provided $1.4 million of the EPM supplemental funding to its Office of Research and Development and Office of Air and Radiation for continued disaster and emergency response support, including analysis in its laboratories and air monitoring, across states affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita."
12,"Introduction This report provides background information and analysis on the following topics: Various aspects of U.S.-Turkey relations, including (1) Turkey's strategic orientation; (2) U.S./NATO cooperation and how a Turkish purchase of an S-400 air defense system from Russia could endanger its acquisition of U.S.-origin F-35 aircraft; (3) the situation in northern Syria, including with Kurdish-led militias; (4) criminal cases of note since the failed 2016 coup attempt in Turkey; and (5) congressional proposals.
Domestic Turkish developments, including politics under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's largely authoritarian and polarizing rule (with local elections scheduled for March 2019), and significant economic concerns.
Much of the report was classified, but an unclassified summary said that the U.S. government has told Turkey that purchasing the S-400 would have ""unavoidable negative consequences for U.S.-Turkey bilateral relations, as well as Turkey's role in NATO,"" including potential sanctions against Turkey under Section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA, P.L. 115-44 ); risk to Turkish participation in the F-35 program (both aircraft acquisition and industrial workshare); risk to other potential U.S. arms transfers to Turkey, and to broader bilateral defense industrial cooperation; reduction in NATO interoperability; and introduction of ""new vulnerabilities from Turkey's increased dependence on Russia for sophisticated military equipment."" U.S. Offer of Patriot System as Alternative to S-400 In July 2018, a State Department official confirmed ongoing U.S. efforts to persuade Turkey to purchase a Patriot air defense system instead of an S-400."
13,"Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program Eligible Public Safety Officers To be eligible for PSOB benefits for death or disability, a person must have served in one of the following categories of public safety officers: law enforcement officer, firefighter, or chaplain in a public agency; FEMA employee or a state, local, or tribal emergency management agency employee; or emergency medical services member."
14,"In recent years, Congress has passed laws to create and improve systems used by government departments and agencies to report and input data on federal awards for contracts, grants, and other financial assistance:  P.L. 109-282 , the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA), called for the creation of a database that became USAspending.gov.
For example Federal grants may go first to the state (the state capital, in one CD), then be distributed to a city or county government (in one or more additional CDs), which then may pass the funds to an organization that spends the money in other CDs. A CD in which a state capital is located may appear to receive more federal funds than other CDs in the state, but searching USAspending.gov data by place of performance rather than recipient location would identify data by the project location."
15,"To facilitate the presentation of the tax equity approach to subsidization, three categories of tax credits that either currently use or have recently used this mechanism are examined: the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC); the new markets tax credit (NMTC); and two energy-related tax credits—the renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) and energy investment tax credit (ITC).
While tax equity investors are not generally required to have an active management role, they have an incentive to monitor the project to ensure it complies with the program's rules, since compliance violations can result in forfeiture of tax credits.
Depending on the structure of the arrangement, the tax equity investor may also secure other benefits, such as additional state and federal tax incentives, a claim to operating income and losses, a share of any capital gains when the underlying investment is sold, or goodwill with the community or regulators.
Tax equity investors in renewable energy projects generally have returns that consist of both tax attributes and operating cash flow to conform to guidance provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Returning to the previous example, if a tax equity investor agrees to contribute 90 cents in equity financing per $1.00 of federal tax credit, it means that for every $1.00 in government subsidy (i.e., tax credit), 10 cents is diverted away from subsidizing the underlying activity and to the investor and middlemen."
16,"Introduction Social Security provides dependent benefits and survivors benefits , sometimes collectively referred to as auxiliary benefits , to the spouses, former spouses, widow(er)s, children, and parents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers.
Currently Married or Separated Spouses Social Security provides a spousal benefit that is equal to 50% of a retired or disabled worker's PIA.
As with spouses of retired or disabled workers, a surviving spouse who is entitled to a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work record and a widow(er)'s benefit receives in effect the higher of the two benefits (see "" Dually Entitled Beneficiaries "" below).
In addition, a divorced spouse who is entitled to a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work record and a spousal or survivor benefit receives in effect the higher of the two benefits (see "" Dually Entitled Beneficiaries "" below).
Dually Entitled Beneficiaries A person may qualify for a spousal or survivor benefit as well as for a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work record (a retired-worker benefit).
Survivor's Benefit Increased to 75% of Couple's Combined Benefit Under current law, an aged surviving spouse receives the higher of his or her own retired-worker benefit and 100% of the deceased spouse's PIA."
17,"Most workers in single-employer plans taken over by PBGC and multiemployer plans that receive financial assistance from PBGC receive the full pension benefit that they earned.
The sponsors of single-employer and multiemployer pension plans pay a flat-rate, per-participant premium.
PBGC's main liabilities are the estimated present values of (1) future benefits payments in the single-employer program and (2) future financial assistance to insolvent plans in the multiemployer program.
The revolving funds contain the premiums paid by single-employer and multiemployer pension plan sponsors, returns on revolving funds' investments, and transfers from the trust fund that are used to pay benefits."
18,"Introduction and Overview The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Department of the Interior's Central Utah Project (CUP) and Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC).
The FY2020 budget request proposes substantial reductions from the FY2019 enacted level for DOE energy research and development (R&D) programs, including a reduction of $178 million (-24%) in fossil fuels and $502 million (-38%) in nuclear energy.
According to DOE, the proposed elimination of the grant programs is ""due to a departmental shift in focus away from deployment activities and towards early-stage R&D."" Proposed Cuts in Energy R&D Appropriations for DOE R&D on energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil energy would be reduced from $4.133 billion in FY2019 to $1.729 billion (-58%) under the Administration's FY2020 budget request.
According to the DOE budget justification, ""USACE will continue to conduct cleanup of FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis."" Bill Status and Recent Funding History  Table 1 indicates the steps during consideration of FY2020 Energy and Water Development appropriations.

20,The House can agree by motion (or unanimous consent) to postpone the consideration of a veto message to a named day or to refer it to committee.
21,"The MAL program may be supplemented by a higher, second tier of revenue support comprised of two other programs: (1) the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, which provides price protection via statutory fixed ""reference"" prices for eligible crops, or (2) the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program, which provides revenue protection via historical moving average revenue guarantees based on the five most recent years of crop prices and yields.
Base Acres B ase acres describes the historical planted acreage on each FSA farm using a multi-year average from as far back as the 1980s, for purposes of calculating program payments under one of the two revenue support programs—PLC or ARC.
PLC and ARC provide income support to covered commodities at levels above the price protection offered by the MAL program's loan rates.
Payments under the PLC program are triggered when the national market-year average farm price (MYAP) for a covered commodity is below its ""effective reference price"" ( Figure 3 ).
Under the 2014 farm bill version of the PLC program, producers received payments on a portion of their enrolled base acres when the national MYAP for the enrolled covered commodity was below its reference price set in statute.
If ARC-CO or PLC program payments are triggered, then they are made on 85% of the producer's base acres that were enrolled for that covered commodity irrespective of actual plantings."
22,"This APA definition of ""rule"" encompasses a wide range of agency action, including certain agency statements that are not subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements outlined elsewhere in the APA: ""[R]ule"" means the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities, appliances, services or allowances therefor or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing on any of the foregoing[.] The CRA narrows this definition by providing that the term ""rule"" does not include (A) any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing; (B) any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or (C) any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.
applicability,"" have ""future effect,"" and be ""designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."" Second, even if an agency statement does qualify as an APA ""rule,"" the CRA expressly exempts three categories of rules from its provisions: rules ""of particular applicability,"" rules ""relating to agency management or personnel,"" and ""any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties."" Both inquiries are heavily fact specific, and require looking beyond a document's label to the substance of the agency's action.
Second, and perhaps more critical, this case law reading ""future effect"" to mean that APA ""rules"" must bind the agency does not explain how to distinguish this requirement from the separate inquiry into whether an agency action is subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.
This statement suggests that Congress intended the CRA to reach a broad range of agency activities, including agency policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain rules of agency organization, despite the fact that those actions are not subject to the APA's requirements for notice and comment.
Although the decision applied to a specific geographic area, it would, in the view of GAO, nonetheless ""have significant economic and environmental impact throughout several major watersheds in the nation's largest state."" The CRA gives examples of some types of rules of particular applicability by specifying that this exemption includes any ""rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing."" Moreover, the post-enactment statement for the record written by the CRA's sponsors maintained that ""IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings are classic examples of rules of particular applicability."" Under the APA, courts have also held, for example, that agency actions designating specific sites as covered by environmental laws are rules of ""particular applicability."" Rules Relating to Agency Management or Personnel The second CRA exemption excludes ""any rule relating to agency management or personnel."" The APA contains a similar exemption from its general rulemaking requirements.
GAO concluded that the information memorandum was a rule for the purposes of the CRA because it was a ""statement of general applicability and future effect, designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy with regard to TANF,"" and it did not fall within any of the three exceptions to the definition of a rule."
23,"Violence Against Women Act of 1994 The Violence Against Women Act of 1994, among other things, (1) enhanced investigations and prosecutions of sex offenses; (2) provided for a number of grant programs to address the issue of violence against women from a variety of angles, including law enforcement, public and private entities and service providers, and victims of crime; and (3) established immigration provisions for abused aliens.
Grant Programs The original VAWA created a number of grant programs for a range of activities, including programs aimed at (1) preventing domestic violence and sexual assault; (2) encouraging collaboration among law enforcement, judicial personnel, and public/private sector providers with respect to services for victims of domestic violence and related crimes; (3) investigating and prosecuting domestic violence and related crimes; (4) encouraging states, tribes, and local governments to treat domestic violence as a serious crime and implement arrest policies; (5) bolstering investigations and prosecutions of domestic violence and child abuse in rural states; and (6) preventing crime in public transportation as well as public and national parks.
It additionally authorized grants for developing model programs for training of state and tribal judges and personnel on laws on rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, and other crimes of violence motivated by the victim's gender.
Other VAWA Requirements Beyond the criminal justice improvements, grant programs, and immigration provisions, VAWA included provisions for several other activities, including requiring that the U.S. Postal Service take measures to ensure confidentiality of domestic violence shelters' and abused persons' addresses; mandating federal research by the Attorney General, National Academy of Sciences, and Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the government's understanding of violence against women; and requesting special studies on campus sexual assault and battered women's syndrome.
VAWA 2013 added several new purpose areas to the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement of Protection Orders program (Arrest Program), one of which was to improve the criminal justice system response to immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking."
24,"Agricultural prices and U.S. exports of certain bulk commodities such as soybeans were further affected in 2018 by retaliatory tariffs imposed on selected U.S. agricultural imports by China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and Turkey.
The direction of the Administration's trade policy—for example, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with Japan and 10 other Pacific-facing nations and engaging in trade disputes with important agricultural trading partners that have resulted in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products—has coincided with market share losses for certain U.S. agricultural exports.
Status : The Administration's trade policy actions have in some cases resulted in retaliatory tariffs against U.S. agricultural product exports, while the status of new agreements with several important agricultural trading partners, such as Canada and Mexico, remains uncertain.
Canada, China, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey—whose exports were affected by the steel and aluminum tariffs—retaliated with tariffs on imports of a range of U.S. agricultural and food products and other goods.
The combination of U.S. absence from CPTPP, retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm and food exports, and the possibility of the United States withdrawing entirely from NAFTA—as President Trump has threatened in the absence of USMCA ratification—could lead to a potential annual drop in U.S. agricultural exports of $21.8 billion, according to a study commissioned by the Farm Foundation.
Under USMCA, market access would be expanded for the agricultural products traded between Canada and the United States that were exempt from tariff elimination under NAFTA.
Canada agreed to create new U.S.-specific TRQs for U.S. dairy products and to replace the existing NAFTA poultry TRQs with new USMCA TRQs. All U.S. exports within the set TRQ volume limit would be subject to zero tariffs rates, but U.S. over-quota exports would still face the higher levels of tariffs currently in place under Canada's WTO commitment.
A study conducted by researchers at the International Monetary Fund assesses the potential impacts of USMCA on North America as a region taking into consideration the following provisions of the proposed USMCA: (1) higher vehicle and auto parts regional value content requirement; (2) new labor value content requirement for vehicles; (3) stricter rules of origin for USMCA textile and apparel trade; (4) agricultural trade liberalization that increases U.S. access to Canadian supply-managed markets and reduces U.S. barriers on Canadian dairy, sugar and sugar products, and peanuts and peanut products; and (5) trade facilitation measures.
Some policymakers have stated that the path to ratifying USMCA by Congress is uncertain, in part because the three countries have yet to resolve disputes over U.S. Section 232 tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum and over the retaliatory tariffs that Canada and Mexico have imposed on U.S. agricultural products.
The suspension agreements limit Mexico's sugar exports to the United States to the residual of U.S. needs for domestic human use in a given marketing year after subtracting U.S. production and imports from other countries.
On the import side of the trade ledger, in March 2019, the United States initiated its review of the Generalized System of Preference (GSP), which provides duty-free tariff treatment for certain products imported from developing countries.
This has become a concern for U.S. agricultural exporters following a series of recently concluded trade agreements among the EU and Canada, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, and other countries that in many cases are also trading partners of the United States.
U.S. producers in the livestock sector look to the U.S. government to negotiate market access agreements, monitor international trading policies, and settle trade disputes, including restrictions that certain countries impose on U.S. exports in response to animal disease concerns."
25,"In the ensuing years, some observers raised concerns that the potential benefits of those regulatory changes (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, potentially higher economic growth over the long term) were outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., compliance costs incurred by banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, potentially slower economic growth).
This section provides background on these ""safety and soundness"" regulations and analyzes selected issues related to them, including prudential regulation related to capital requirements and the Volcker Rule (which restricts proprietary trading); requirements facing banks related to anti-money laundering laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act (P.L. 91-508); and challenges related to cybersecurity.
Whether the benefits of capital requirements (e.g., increased bank and financial system stability) are generally outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., reduced credit availability) is an issue subject to debate.
Bank regulators have issued a proposal to implement this provision wherein banks (1) below the threshold that (2) meet at least a 9% leverage ratio measure of equity and certain retained earnings to assets and (3) had limited off-balance sheet exposures and limited securities trading activity (among other requirements) would qualify for the exemption.
The section also analyzes related issues, including whether the CFPB has used its authorities and regulations of banking institutions appropriately; concerns relating to the lack of consumer access to banking services; and whether the Community Reinvestment Act as currently implemented is effectively and efficiently meeting its goal of ensuring banks provide credit to the areas in which they operate.
In addition to these and other new regulations, the CFPB also provides information on its supervisory activities related to banks, such as instances where its examiners found that certain financial institutions misrepresented service fees associated with deposit and checking accounts.
Currently, these requirements raise a number of policy questions, including whether companies established primarily as financial technology companies should be able to receive a national bank charter, as has been offered by the OCC; and whether the application process and determinations made by the FDIC as they relate to institutions seeking a specific type of state charter, called an industrial loan company (ILC) charter, is overly restrictive.
The OCC stated that fintech firms granted the charter ""will be subject to the same high standards of safety and soundness and fairness that all federally chartered banks must meet,"" and also that the OCC ""may need to account for differences in business models and activities, risks, and the inapplicability of certain laws resulting from the uninsured status of the bank."" Thus, the argument goes, establishing a fintech charter would mean a new set of innovative companies would no longer face regulatory uncertainty and could safely and efficiently provide beneficial financial services, perhaps to populations and market-niches that banks with traditional cost structures do not find cost-effective to serve.
Given the interest in and debate surrounding this charter type, policymakers will likely examine questions over the extent to which ILCs create innovative sources of credit and financial services subject to appropriate safeguards or inadvisably allow commercial organizations to act as banks with federal safety nets while exempting them from certain bank regulation and supervision."
26,"These requirements include the following: The proposed vehicle must be able to self-deploy from amphibious shipping and deliver a reinforced Marine infantry squad (17 marines) from a launch distance at or beyond 12 miles with a speed of not less than 8 knots in seas with 1-foot significant wave height and must be able to operate in seas up to 3-foot significant wave height.
These requirements included the following: The vehicle must accommodate nine marines and two crew members and have a ""robust tactical swim capability (shore-to-shore [not designed to embark from an amphibious ship]) and be capable of operating at 6 knots in a fully developed sea."" The vehicle must be able to operate on land with M-1A1s in mechanized task forces across the Marine Corps' mission profile."
27,"At the beginning of the 116 th Congress, the House adopted a standing rule that would provide for legislation suspending the statutory debt limit to be considered as passed by the House, without a separate vote, when the House adopts the budget resolution for a fiscal year."
28,"Other issues relate to access, including alternatives to on-site consumption in summer meals and implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision, an option to provide free meals to all students in certain schools.
Specifically, the law required USDA to issue proposed regulations for competitive foods nutrition standards within one year after enactment and for school meals nutrition standards within 18 months after enactment.
According to the bill, the revisions would have had to ensure that the standards, particularly those related to milk, ""(1) are based on research based on school-age children; (2) do not add costs in addition to the reimbursements required to carry out the school lunch program … and (3) maintain healthy meals for students."" This provision was not included in the enacted bill."
29,"Dollar amounts come from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Foreign Aid Explorer database (Explorer) and annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations acts.
In its broadest sense, U.S. foreign aid is defined under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), the primary legislative basis of foreign aid programs, as  any tangible or intangible item provided by the United States Government [including ""by means of gift, loan, sale, credit, or guaranty""] to a foreign country or international organization under this or any other Act, including but not limited to any training, service, or technical advice, any item of real, personal, or mixed property, any agricultural commodity, United States dollars, and any currencies of any foreign country which are owned by the United States Government....
During the past 15 years, DOD-funded and implemented aid programs in Iraq and Afghanistan to train and equip foreign forces and win hearts and minds through development efforts were often considerably larger than the traditional military and development assistance programs provided under the foreign operations appropriations.
However, since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, policymakers frequently have cast foreign assistance as a tool in U.S. counterterrorism strategy, increasing aid to partner states in counterterrorism efforts and funding the substantial reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In 2006, in an effort to rationalize the assistance program more clearly, the State Department developed a framework that organizes U.S. foreign aid around five strategic objectives, each of which includes a number of program elements, also known as sectors.
This methodology reflects the organization of aid accounts within the SFOPS appropriations but can easily be applied to the international food aid title of the Agriculture appropriations as well as to the DOD and other government agency assistance programs with funding outside traditional foreign aid budget accounts.
The Obama Administration's FY2012 international affairs budget proposed that the overseas contingency operations (OCO) designation, which had been applied since 2009 to war-related Defense appropriations, including to DOD assistance programs such as ISFF, ASFF and CERP, be extended to include ""extraordinary, but temporary, costs of the Department of State and USAID in the front line states of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Congress not only adopted the OCO designation in the FY2012 SFOPS appropriations legislation, but expanded it to include funding for additional accounts and countries."

The lack of a decreasing ozone trend at many monitors in the West could be due to a number of causes: increasing seasonal average temperatures, an increase in incidents of fire since 1986, emissions from oil and gas development, increasing contributions from international transport of air pollution, and increasing global methane concentrations."
33,"The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952, as amended, provides for the granting of asylum to an alien who applies for such relief in accordance with applicable requirements and is determined to be a refugee .
If the asylum officer determines than an applicant is not eligible for asylum and the applicant appears to be inadmissible or deportable under the INA, however, DHS regulations direct the officer to refer the case to an immigration judge for adjudication in removal proceedings.
Under the INA, an individual who is determined by DHS to be inadmissible to the United States because he or she lacks proper documentation or has committed fraud or willful misrepresentation of facts to obtain documentation or another immigration benefit (and thus is subject to expedited removal) and expresses the intent to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution is to be interviewed by an asylum officer to determine if he or she has a credible fear of persecution.
Specifically, the Convention prohibited states from expelling or returning a refugee ""to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."" In the 1970s, INS issued regulations that established procedures for applying for asylum in the United States and for adjudicating asylum applications.
The first directed the Attorney General to establish asylum application procedures for aliens physically present in the United States or arriving at a land border or port of entry, regardless of immigration status, and gave the Attorney General discretionary authority to grant asylum to aliens who met the newly added INA definition of a refugee.
The INA provision in effect prior to the enactment of the Refugee Act ""authorized"" the Attorney General to withhold the deportation of an alien in the United States (other than an alien involved in Nazi-related activity) to ""any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion or political opinion."" The Refugee Act revised this language to prohibit the Attorney General from deporting or returning any alien to a country where the Attorney General determines the alien's life or freedom would be threatened because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.
Asylum Provisions IIRIRA added restrictions to the general policy set forth in the 1980 Refugee Act and incorporated into the INA that an alien who is present in the United States or who arrives in the United States, regardless of immigration status, can apply for asylum.
(Special procedures apply to aliens arriving in the United States at a U.S.-Canada land port of entry in accordance with a U.S.-Canada agreement; see "" Safe Third Country Agreements ."") Under the INA, credible fear of persecution means that ""there is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum."" If an alien is found to have a credible fear, the asylum officer is to refer the case to an immigration judge for full consideration of the asylum request during standard removal proceedings."
34,"Five months into his six-year term, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador enjoys an approval ratings of 78%, even as his government is struggling to address rising insecurity and sluggish growth.
This report provides an overview of political and economic conditions in Mexico, followed by assessments of selected issues of congressional interest in Mexico: security and foreign aid, extraditions, human rights, trade, migration, energy, education, environment, and water issues.
Partially as a result of these new constraints on executive power, the country's first two presidents from the conservative National Action Party (PAN)—Vicente Fox (2000-2006) and Felipe Calderón (2006-2012)—struggled to enact some of the reforms designed to address Mexico's economic and security challenges.
Even as many groups have developed into multifaceted illicit enterprises, government efforts to seize criminal assets have been modest and attempts to prosecute money laundering cases have had ""significant shortcomings."" With violence reaching historic levels during the first quarter of 2019 and high-profile massacres occurring, President López Obrador is under increasing pressure to refine his security strategy.
During a recent visit to Mexico, Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recognized President López Obrador's efforts to put human rights at the center of his government.
In December 2018, López Obrador announced a plan to invest some $25 billion in southern Mexico to accompany an estimated $4.8 billion in potential U.S. public and private investments to promote job growth, infrastructure, and development in that region, including jobs for Central American migrants.
In 2011, the U.S. and Mexican governments agreed to a revised four-pillar strategy that prioritized (1) combating transnational criminal organizations through intelligence sharing and law enforcement operations; (2) institutionalizing the rule of law while protecting human rights through justice sector reform and forensic assistance; (3) creating a ""21 st century border"" while improving immigration enforcement in Mexico; and (4) building strong and resilient communities with pilot programs to address the root causes of violence and reduce drug demand.
U.S. assistance to Mexico has supported the Mexican government's efforts to reform its judicial system and to improve human rights conditions in the country.
The Mexican government expressed regret after the Administration's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, which has provided work authorization and relief from removal for migrants brought to the United States as children, but pledged to assist DACA beneficiaries who return to Mexico.
As an example, President Trump has recently threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border or to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican motor vehicle exports to the United States if the Mexican government does not increase its efforts to stop U.S.-bound migrants over the coming year."

39,"Introduction The Trump Administration's Nuclear Posture Review, released on February 2, 2018, includes plans for the United States to deploy two new types of nuclear weapons ""to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of U.S. nuclear forces."" The report highlights that these weapons represent a response to Russia's deployment of a much larger stockpile of lower-yield nonstrategic nuclear weapons and to Russia's apparent belief ""that limited nuclear first use, potentially including low yield weapons"" can provide ""a coercive advantage in crises and at lower levels of conflict."" The two capabilities identified in the NPR are a new low-yield nuclear warhead to be deployed on U.S. long-range submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a new sea-launched cruise missile that could be deployed on Navy ships or attack submarines.
The report states that the United States does not need to deploy ""non-strategic nuclear capabilities that quantitatively match or mimic Russia's more expansive arsenal."" But it indicates that ""expanding flexible U.S. nuclear options now, to include low yield options, is important for the preservation of credible deterrence against regional aggression."" The NPR's recommended deployment of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons follows growing concerns, both in Congress and among analysts outside of government, about new nuclear challenges facing the United States.
In response to these concerns, the Senate, in its Resolution of Ratification on New START, stated that the United States should seek to initiate within one year, ""negotiations with the Russian Federation on an agreement to address the disparity between the non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation and of the United States and to secure and reduce tactical nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner."" In addition, in the FY2013 Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 4310 , §1037), Congress again indicated that ""the United States should pursue negotiations with the Russian Federation aimed at the reduction of Russian deployed and nondeployed nonstrategic nuclear forces."" Although the United States did raise the issue of negotiations on nonstrategic nuclear weapons with Russia within the year after New START entered into force, the two nations have not moved forward with efforts to negotiate limits on these weapons.
They included among these steps a call for nations to eliminate ""short-range nuclear weapons designed to be forward-deployed."" In a subsequent article published in January 2008, they elaborated on this step, calling for ""a dialogue, including within NATO and with Russia, on consolidating the nuclear weapons designed for forward deployment to enhance their security, as a first step toward careful accounting for them and their eventual elimination."" They noted, specifically, that ""these smaller and more portable nuclear weapons are, given their characteristics, inviting acquisition targets for terrorist groups."" In addition, as a part of its renewed interest in the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy, Congress established, in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Bill ( P.L. 110-181 §1062), a Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States.
The 2018 NPR also echoes the Obama Administration's NPR, indicating that the United States will maintain ""the capability to forward deploy nuclear bombers and DCA around the world."" It also states that the United States will continue Obama-era programs to communicate with and consult allies ""on policy, strategy and capabilities."" The 2018 NPR also supports of the recent changes in NATO's approach to nuclear modernization and planning, indicating that the United States is ""committed to upgrading DCA [dual capable aircraft] with the nuclear-capable F-35 aircraft"" and that the United States will ""work with NATO to best ensure—and improve where needed—the readiness, survivability, and operational effectiveness of DCA based in Europe."" However, while the 2010 NPR called for the retirement of U.S. Tomahawk nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles (TLAMN), the 2018 NPR calls for the development of a new sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM).
As the Cold War drew to a close, NATO acknowledged that it would no longer maintain nuclear weapons to deter or defeat a conventional attack from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact because ""the threat of a simultaneous, full-scale attack on all of NATO's European fronts has effectively been removed."" But NATO documents indicated that these weapons would still play an important political role in NATO's strategy by ensuring ""uncertainty in the mind of any potential aggressor about the nature of the Allies' response to military aggression."" Force Structure Throughout the Cold War, the United States often altered the size and structure of its nonstrategic nuclear forces in response to changing capabilities and changing threat assessments.
The document noted that the allies are ""resolved to seek a safer world for all and to create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons in accordance with the goals of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, in a way that promotes international stability, and is based on the principle of undiminished security for all."" It also noted that the alliance had ""dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe"" and had reduced the role of nuclear weapons in NATO strategy."" The allies pledged to ""seek to create the conditions for further reductions in the future."" The Strategic Concept indicated that the goal in these reductions should be to ""seek Russian agreement to increase transparency on its nuclear weapons in Europe and relocate these weapons away from the territory of NATO members."" Moreover, the document noted that this arms control process ""must take into account the disparity with the greater Russian stockpiles of short-range nuclear weapons."" Hence, even though NATO no longer viewed Russia as an adversary, the allies apparently agreed that the disparity in nonstrategic nuclear weapons could create security concerns for some members of the alliance.
Where the 2012 DDPR had called for discussions with Russia on transparency and confidence-building and indicated that NATO would consider negotiating reductions in forward-based forces, the 2016 Warsaw statement simply noted that ""arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation continue to play an important role in the achievement of the Alliance's security objectives."" It then stated that, ""in this context, it is of paramount importance that disarmament and non-proliferation commitments under existing treaties are honoured ...
Moreover, the possible use of nuclear weapons, and extended nuclear deterrence, were a part of a broader concept that the Obama Administration referred to as ""regional security architectures."" The 2010 NPR indicated that regional security architectures were a key part of ""the U.S. strategy for strengthening regional deterrence while reducing the role and numbers of nuclear weapons."" As a result, these architectures would ""include effective missile defense, counter-WMD capabilities, conventional power-projection capabilities, and integrated command and control—all underwritten by strong political commitments."" In other words, although the United States would continue to extend deterrence to its allies and seek to assure them of the U.S. commitment to their security, it would draw on political commitments and a range of military capabilities to achieve these goals.
For example, former Secretary of Defense Perry stated, during the Clinton Administration, that ""maintaining U.S. nuclear commitments with NATO, and retaining the ability to deploy nuclear capabilities to meet various regional contingencies , continues to be an important means for deterring aggression, protecting and promoting U.S. interests, reassuring allies and friends, and preventing proliferation (emphasis added).""  Specifically, both during the Cold War and after the demise of the Soviet Union, the United States maintained the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks with conventional, chemical, or biological weapons.
It indicates that the United States will ""maintain, and enhance as necessary, the capability to forward deploy nuclear bombers and DCA around the world"" and will ""work with NATO to best ensure—and improve where needed—the readiness, survivability, and operational effectiveness of DCA based in Europe."" The 2018 NPR also reinforces U.S. support for measures that NATO is taking to ensure that its ""overall deterrence and defense posture, including its nuclear forces, remain capable of addressing any potential adversary's doctrine and capabilities."" These measures include, among other things, enhancing ""the readiness and survivability of NATO DCA"" and improving the ""capabilities required to increase their operational effectiveness""; promoting ""the broadest possible participation of Allies in their agreed burden sharing arrangements""; and enhancing ""the realism of training and exercise programs to ensure the Alliance can effectively integrate nuclear and non-nuclear operations."" On the other hand, the 2018 NPR reverses the Obama Administration's decision to remove sea-launched cruise missiles from the U.S. force structure."
40,"The regulations implementing Section 504 contain similar provisions requiring recipients of federal money operating public elementary and secondary schools ""to identify and locate every qualified handicapped person residing in the recipient's jurisdiction who is not receiving a public education."" Section 504's regulations also require LEAs to evaluate students individually before classifying them as having a disability or providing them with accommodations, special education, or related services.
Even though schools may have eligibility requirements for such courses, ED has concluded that both sets of regulations make it ""unlawful to deny a student with a disability admission to an accelerated class or program solely because of that student's need for special education or related aids and services."" Private School Placements Because the IDEA is designed to improve the education of all children with qualifying disabilities, the act also provides benefits and services to eligible children enrolled by their parents in private school.
As part of their right to a FAPE, each child receiving services under the IDEA must have an IEP stating the specific special education and related services the LEA will provide to meet his or her needs."
41,"By contrast, courts have generally held that because physicians who provide medical services at facilities operated by the United States often operate relatively independently of the federal government's control, such physicians ordinarily qualify as ""independent contractors, and not employees of the government for FTCA purposes.""  The Boyle Rule Because the FTCA's prohibition against suits by individual employees does not insulate independent contractors from liability, a plaintiff injured by the tortious action of an independent contractor working for the federal government may potentially be able to recover compensation directly from that contractor.
engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment."" By creating a mechanism by which the United States may substitute itself as the defendant in the individual employee's place, the FTCA effectively ""immunize[s] covered federal employees not simply from liability, but from suit."" In this way, the FTCA ""relieve[s] covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit"" and instead places ""those burdens on the Government's shoulders."" In some cases, the Attorney General's decision to substitute the United States in the officer's place may adversely affect the plaintiff's chances of prevailing on his claims.
Thus, under certain circumstances, the FTCA will shield both the United States and its employees from liability for its tortious actions, thereby effectively ""leav[ing] certain tort victims without any remedy.""  ""In such cases, to try to preserve their lawsuits"" against the federal employee, the plaintiff may attempt to ""contest the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification."" That is, the plaintiff may argue that the government employee defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment, such that the suit should therefore proceed against the government official in his personal capacity.
Relatedly, exposing the United States to liability for discretionary acts could cause government officials to ""spend an inordinate amount of their tax-payer compensated time responding to lawsuits"" rather than serving the ""greater good of the community."" The discretionary function exception thus ""marks the boundary between Congress' willingness to impose tort liability upon the United States and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.""  As explained in greater detail in the following subsections, to determine whether the discretionary function exception bars a particular plaintiff's suit under the FTCA, courts examine whether the federal employee was engaged in conduct that was (1) discretionary and (2) policy-driven."

Qualifying CRA activities include mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities.
For example, banks may receive CRA credits for such activities as  investing in special purpose community development entities (CDEs), which facilitate capital investments in LMI communities (discussed below); providing support (e.g., consulting, detailing an employee, processing transactions for free or at a discounted rate, and providing office facilities) to minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions (MWLIs), thereby enhancing their ability to serve LMI customers; serving as a joint lender for a loan originated by MWLIs; facilitating financial literacy education to LMI communities, including any support of efforts of MWLIs and CDEs to provide financial literacy education; opening or maintaining bank branches and other transactions facilities in LMI communities and designated disaster areas; providing low-cost education loans to low-income borrowers; and offering international remittance services in LMI communities.

Congress also expressed support for the peacetime registration program as a ""contribution to national security by reducing the time required for full defense mobilization,"" and as sending ""an important signal to our allies and to our potential adversaries of the United States defense commitment."" On November 6, 1986, President Reagan signed into law the Immigration Reform and Control Act. This law required males between the ages of 18 and 26 who are applying for legalization under the act to register for the Selective Service if they have not already done so.
Section 552 of the FY2017 NDAA also required DOD to prepare a preliminary report on the purpose and utility of the SSS to support the commission's work, to include (1) A detailed analysis of the current benefits derived, both directly and indirectly, from the Military Selective Service System, including— (A) the extent to which mandatory registration benefits military recruiting; (B) the extent to which a national registration capability serves as a deterrent to potential enemies of the United States; and (C) the extent to which expanding registration to include women would impact these benefits.
With respect to the SSS, the commission is considering options that could expand the registration requirement to include women; identify individuals who possess critical skills the nation might need; call for volunteers during times of emergency using the existing system; and, incorporate reasonable changes to identify, evaluate, and protect those who object to military service, but are otherwise willing to serve.
If the SSS were activated with the authority to induct individuals, the agency would be responsible for (1) holding a national draft lottery, (2) contacting registrants who are selected via the lottery, (3) arranging transportation for selectees to Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) for testing and evaluation of fitness to serve, and (4) activating a classification structure that would include area offices, local offices, and appeal boards."
53,"On December 13, 2018, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 1091 (116 th Congress) by a vote of 394-1, stating ""the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military and security forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against humanity and genocide"" and calling on the Secretary of State to ""determine, based on available evidence, whether the actions by the Burmese military in northern Rakhine State in 2017 constitute crimes against humanity, genocide, or other crimes under international law."" Various organizations—including the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission in Myanmar (UNFFM), multiple human rights organizations, and the press—have conducted investigations into allegations that Burmese security forces committed serious human rights violations in Burma's seven ethnic states since the Tatmadaw transferred power to a mixed civilian/military government in 2011.
The UNFFM report recommends that the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) refer the human rights abuse allegations to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigation and possible prosecution."
54,"Four agencies (referred to in this report as the federal land management agencies, or FLMAs) administer a total of 608 million acres (~95%) of these federal lands: the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all in the Department of the Interior (DOI).
For lands retained in federal ownership, discussion has focused on whether to curtail or expand certain land designations (e.g., national monuments proclaimed by the President or wilderness areas designated by Congress) and whether current management procedures should be changed (e.g., to allow a greater role for state and local governments or to expand economic considerations in decisionmaking).
Agencies Managing Federal Lands The four FLMAs and BOEM manage most federal lands (onshore and offshore, surface and subsurface) Forest Service (FS) , in the Department of Agriculture, manages the 193 million acre National Forest System under a multiple-use mission, including livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, recreation, timber production, watershed protection, and wildlife and fish habitat.
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) , in the Department of the Interior (DOI), manages 246 million acres of public lands, also under a multiple-use mission of livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, recreation, timber production, watershed protection, and wildlife and fish habitat.
Several other issues have been under debate, including whether to provide the fund with additional permanent appropriations; direct revenues from other activities to the LWCF; limit the use of funds for particular purposes, such as federal land acquisition; and require some of the funds to be used for certain purposes, such as facility maintenance.
CRS Products CRS Report R43997, Deferred Maintenance of Federal Land Management Agencies: FY2007-FY2016 Estimates and Issues , by Carol Hardy Vincent.
The 116 th Congress may continue debate over issues related to access to and availability of onshore and offshore federal lands for energy and mineral development.
Congressional interest in renewable energy resources on onshore federal lands has focused on whether to expand the leasing program for wind and solar projects versus maintaining the current right-of-way authorization process, and how to balance environmental concerns with the development and production of these resources.
Issues for Congress include broad questions of OHV access and management, as well as OHV use at individual parks, forests, conservation areas, and other federal sites.
Congress frequently considers species management issues, such as balancing land and resources use, providing access to hunting and fishing on federal lands, and implementing endangered species protections."
55,"Overview On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted to Congress its FY2019 budget request, which included $41.86 billion of base (or enduring) funds for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS).
Similar to the House and Senate committee bills, the FY2019 enacted appropriation ( P.L. 116-6 ) maintained funding for the State Department and Related Agency category slightly above FY2018 funding level.
According to the State Department, planned CSD activities, for which $20 million was requested, included ""coordinating U.S. government efforts in specific sub-regions; enhancing the capacity of local actors to build resilience against disinformation, including thwarting attacks on their IT systems; providing attribution of adversarial disinformation; and convening anti-disinformation practitioners, journalists, and other influencers to exchange best practices, build networks, and generate support for U.S. efforts against disinformation."" The House committee report registered concern regarding ""foreign propaganda and disinformation that threatens United States national security, especially as carried out by China, Russia, and extremists groups"" and asserted that the GEC ""is expected to use a wide range of technologies and techniques to counter these campaigns,"" consistent with its statutory mandate.
The House committee report maintained that funds the House bill made available for ESCM would allow for the State Department's CSCS and MCS contributions, when combined with those from other agencies and consular fees, to exceed the ARB's annual recommended funding and support "" the accelerated multi-year program to construct new secure replacement facilities for the most vulnerable embassies and consulates."" The Senate committee bill stipulated that of funds made available for ESCM by it and prior acts making appropriations for SFOPS, not less than $1.02 billion shall be made available for the department's FY2019 CSCS and MCS contributions; the joint explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 116-6 indicated that Congress provided the same amount for this purpose for FY2019.
Together with food aid accounts in the Agriculture appropriation, total enacted foreign aid within the international affairs budget was $39.85 billion, or 0.7% below the FY2018 actual funding level and 39% above the FY2019 request."
56,"LNG as an engine, or ""bunker,"" fuel potentially could help the United States reduce harmful air emissions, it could create a new market for domestic natural gas, and it could create economic opportunities in domestic shipbuilding.
This report discusses impending International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards limiting the maximum sulfur content in shipping fuels, the market conditions in which LNG may compete to become a common bunker fuel for vessel operators, and the current status of LNG bunkering globally and in the United States.
Although switching to low-sulfur fuels would increase fuel costs compared to conventional, high-sulfur fuels, it would require little or no upfront capital cost and would allow ocean carriers to use existing infrastructure to bunker ships at ports.
Added costs associated with marketing, storing and transporting LNG in bunkering operations (discussed below) would likely require ports to charge a rate for LNG bunker fuel above spot market prices.
Port Fourchon, LA In 2015, Harvey Gulf International Marine (Harvey) began LNG bunkering operations in the Gulf of Mexico to fuel its small fleet of LNG-powered offshore supply vessels serving offshore oil rigs.
Domestic Considerations The IMO sulfur standards apply to ship owners globally, as does the development of new LNG supply and bunkering infrastructure."
57,"The 2011 Debt Ceiling Episode Begins On May 16, 2011, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced that the federal debt had reached its statutory limit and declared a debt issuance suspension period, which would allow certain extraordinary measures to extend Treasury's borrowing capacity until about August 2, 2011.
The Treasury Secretary, in a letter to Congress dated May 2, 2011, had indicated that he would declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, unless Congress acted beforehand, which would allow certain extraordinary measures to extend Treasury's borrowing capacity until early August 2011.
In particular, the BCA included major provisions that imposed discretionary spending caps, enforced by automatic spending reductions, referred to as a ""sequester""; established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, whose recommendations would be eligible for expedited consideration; required a vote on a joint resolution on a proposed constitutional amendment to mandate a balanced federal budget; and instituted a mechanism allowing for the President and Treasury Secretary to raise the debt ceiling, subject to congressional disapproval.
Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew notified Congress on May 20, 2013, that he had declared a new debt issuance suspension period (DISP), triggering authorities that allow the Treasury Secretary to use extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until August 2.
In December 2013, the U.S. Treasury had notified congressional leaders that according to its estimates, extraordinary measures would extend its borrowing authority ""only until late February or early March 2014."" On January 22, 2014, Secretary Lew called for an increase in the debt limit before the end of debt limit suspension on February 7, 2014, or the end of February.
Once the most recent debt limit suspension lapsed, Treasury Secretary Lew declared a Debt Issuance Suspension Period (DISP) on March 16, 2015, which empowered him to use extraordinary measures to meet federal fiscal obligations until July 30, 2015."
58,"The act specifies that the SBA's mission is to promote the interests of small businesses to enhance competition in the private marketplace: It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.
The SBA currently administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion.
Four additional programs are provided recommended funding in appropriations acts under ED programs, but are discussed in other sections of this report because of the nature of their assistance: (1) the SBA's Growth Accelerators Initiative ($2 million in FY2019) is a capital investment program and is discussed in the capital access programs section; (2) the SBA's 7(j) Technical Assistance Program ($2.8 million in FY2019) provides contacting assistance and is discussed in the contracting programs section; (3) the National Women's Business Council ($1.5 million in FY2019) is a bipartisan federal advisory council and is discussed in the executive direction programs section; and (4) the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP, $18 million in FY2019) provides grants to states to support export programs that assist small business concerns.
The Emerging Leaders initiative is a seven‐month executive leader education series consisting of ""more than 100 hours of specialized training, technical support, access to a professional network, and other resources to strengthen their businesses and promote economic development."" At the conclusion of the training, ""participants produce a three‐year strategic growth action plan with benchmarks and performance targets that help them access the necessary support and resources to move forward for the next stage of business growth."" The Learning Center is the SBA's primary online training service, which offers free online courses on business planning, marketing, government contracting, accounting, and social media, providing learners an ""opportunity to access entrepreneurship education resources through toolkits, fact sheets, infographic tip sheets, instructor guides, and audio content."" Capital Access Programs Overview The SBA has authority to make direct loans but, with the exception of disaster loans and loans to Microloan program intermediaries, has not exercised that authority since 1998.
For example, businesses participating in the SBA's 7(a) loan guaranty program are deemed small if they either meet the SBA's industry-specific size standards for firms in 1,047 industrial classifications in 18 subindustry activities described in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) or do not have more than $15 million in tangible net worth and not more than $5 million in average net income after federal taxes (excluding any carryover losses) for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application.
In an effort to assist small business owners, in FY2019, the SBA is waiving the annual service fee for 7(a) loans of $150,000 or less made to small businesses located in a rural area or a HUBZone and reducing the up-front one-time guaranty fee for these loans from 2.0% to 0.6667% of the guaranteed portion of the loan in FY2019; and pursuant to P.L. 114-38 , the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, the up-front, one-time guaranty fee on all veteran loans under the 7(a) SBAExpress program (up to and including $350,000).
The act also provided the SBA an additional $697.5 million; including $510 million to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses."
59,"Major disaster declarations also authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grant assistance to state, local, and tribal governments, residences, and certain private nonprofit (PNP) facilities that provide critical services.
Alternatively, Congress might implement a small business disaster grant program and continue to provide loan assistance through the SBA.
Elements of the arguments for and against small business disaster grants outlined above will be explored in greater detail in "" Policy Considerations and Options for Congress ."" Historical Developments Some question why the federal government provides grant assistance to individuals and households, state, local, and tribal governments, and nonprofit organizations, among others, but not to businesses.
The Disaster Relief Act established a permanent authority that committed the federal government to provide specific types of assistance to states and localities (but not businesses) following a major disaster declaration.
Some of the considerations Congress may contemplate for a potential small business disaster grant program include: (1) preventing the duplication of administrative functions and benefits; (2) the selection of the authorization statute; (3) whether (and what type of) declarations and designations will put the disaster grant program into effect; (4) what size businesses should be eligible for disaster grant assistance; and (5) the types of activities eligible for grant assistance.
If Congress authorized a small business disaster grant program under the Stafford Act, it could consider using the existing declaration and IA designation framework used to trigger eligibility for the SBA Disaster Loan Program.
If Congress were to authorize a small business disaster grant program, it may also consider whether the grants should be available for economic loss or limit them to specific types of damage."
60,"For example The 2002 farm bill (the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, P.L. 107-171 ) was enacted under a budget surplus that allowed it to make changes that were projected to increase spending by $73 billion, or 22%, over a 10-year budget window—more than half of which was for the farm commodity programs.
The 2008 farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246 ) was officially budget neutral, though it included $10 billion of offsets over 10 years from tax-related and other provisions that allowed it to increase spending on the Nutrition, Conservation, and Disaster titles."
61,"OMB guidelines on user fees outline aims similar to the benefit principle, mandating that federal agencies  ensure that each service, sale, or use of Government goods or resources provided by an agency to specific recipients be self-sustaining; promote efficient allocation of the Nation's resources by establishing charges for special benefits provided to the recipient that are at least as great as costs to the Government of providing the special benefits; and allow the private sector to compete with the Government without disadvantage in supplying comparable services, resources, or goods where appropriate.
Logic of Pigou Taxation May Apply to Design of User Fees and Charges The benefit principle is in some ways similar to the concept of Pigou taxation—that taxing goods linked to negative spillovers, such as pollution, can enhance economic efficiency by diminishing those spillovers."
62,"Administration's Recent Budget Requests The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request proposed eliminating McGovern-Dole and FFP Title II and moving funding for international food aid to the IDA account within the SFOPS appropriations bill.
FY2018 enacted funding of $1.716 billion for FFP Title II includes $1.6 billion provided in the Foreign Assistance title and $116 million provided in the General Provisions title of the Agriculture Appropriations Act. The funding Congress provides in the Foreign Assistance title is a base amount that is often compared across fiscal years to determine whether program funding has increased or decreased."
63,"Specific topics of interest may include ongoing issues such as interest in reforming the nation's housing finance system, how to prioritize appropriations for federal housing programs in a limited funding environment, oversight of the implementation of changes to certain housing programs that were enacted in prior Congresses, and the possibility of extending certain temporary housing-related tax provisions.
In general, rising home prices, relatively low interest rates, and rising rental costs have been prominent features of housing and mortgage markets in recent years.
In addition to addressing the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, housing finance reform legislation could potentially involve changes to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or other federal programs that support the mortgage market.
Proposals differ on structural questions as well as on specific implementation issues, such as whether, and how, certain affordable housing requirements that currently apply to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be included in a new system.
Additionally, the budget references policy changes designed to reduce the cost of federal rental assistance programs, including the Making Affordable Housing Work Act of 2018 (MAHWA) legislative proposal, released by HUD in April 2018."
64,"Indeed, the Supreme Court in 1943 described the First Amendment's protection against compelled speech as a ""fixed star in our constitutional constellation."" Accordingly, government actions mandating speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny by courts, and will be upheld ""only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests."" However, the Court has also long accepted a variety of laws that require commercial actors to make certain disclosures to consumers, confirming that Congress can compel certain disclosures, even those involving protected speech, without running afoul of the First Amendment.
Instead, the Court noted that the state's provision only involved ""commercial advertising, and its prescription has taken the form of a requirement that appellant include in his advertising purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which his services will be available."" In this commercial context, the Court said that the attorney's ""constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal,"" noting that in previous cases it had stated that states might ""appropriately require[]"" warnings or disclaimers ""in order to dissipate the possibility of consumer confusion or deception."" Rather than applying heightened scrutiny, the Court held that under these circumstances, ""an advertiser's rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers."" The Zauderer Court did warn, however, that commercial disclosure requirements raise First Amendment concerns, observing that ""unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements might offend the First Amendment by chilling protected commercial speech."" But the Court rejected the contention that the disclosure requirement before it was unduly burdensome.
In rejecting a litigant's argument that the Supreme Court's decision in United Foods limited Zauderer only to laws intended to prevent consumer deception, the Second Circuit said that United Foods ""simply distinguishes Zauderer on the basis that the compelled speech in Zauderer was necessary to prevent deception of consumers; it does not provide that all other disclosure requirements are subject to heightened scrutiny."" Zauderer Review  If a commercial disclosure requirement involves only ""purely factual and uncontroversial information"" about the goods or services being sold, and is therefore eligible for review under Zauderer , then it will be constitutional so long as the disclosure requirement is ""reasonably related"" to the government's interest.
would understand them to be judicial endorsements."" The court, however, said that even assuming ""that excerpts of judicial opinions are potentially misleading to some persons,"" the state had failed ""to explain how [an attorney's] providing a complete judicial opinion somehow dispels this assumed threat of deception."" The court reasoned that ""providing a full judicial opinion does not reveal to a potential client that an excerpt of the same opinion is not an endorsement."" Additionally, the court held that the disputed requirement was ""unduly burdensome,"" as it ""effectively rules out the possibility that [an attorney] can advertise with even an accurately quoted excerpt of a judicial statement about his abilities."" And in the view of the Third Circuit, ""that type of restriction—an outright ban on advertising with judicial excerpts—would properly be analyzed under the heightened Central Hudson standard of scrutiny."" As Dwyer suggests, courts may strike down disclosure requirements under Zauderer if the requirement is ""unduly burdensome."" In NIFLA , the Supreme Court held that the unlicensed notice was likely unconstitutional because it ""unduly burden[ed] protected speech,"" noting that it applied to all advertisements for these licensed facilities, regardless of their content."
65,"U.S. policy seeks to support the long-term development of Iraq's military, counterterrorism, and police services as alternatives to the continued use of PMF units to secure Iraq's borders, communities, and territory recaptured from the Islamic State.
In January 2019, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that the PMC/PMF ""plan to use newfound political power gained through positions in the new government to reduce or remove the U.S. military presence while competing with the Iraqi security forces for state resources.""  In general, the popularity of the PMF and broadly expressed popular respect for the sacrifices made by individual volunteers in the fight against the Islamic State create complicated political questions for Iraqi leaders.
That said, U.S. military officials report that ""competition over areas to operate and influence between the PMF and the ISF will likely result in violence, abuse, and tension in areas where both entities operate.""  The Kurdistan Region and Relations with Baghdad The Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq (KRI) enjoys considerable administrative autonomy under the terms of Iraq's 2005 federal constitution, but issues concerning territory, security, energy, and revenue sharing continue to strain ties between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the national government in Baghdad.
U.S. Policy and Issues in the 116th Congress Security Cooperation and U.S. Training Iraqi military and counterterrorism operations against remnants of the Islamic State group are ongoing, and the United States military and its coalition partners continue to provide support to those efforts at the request of the Iraqi government.
These parallel (and sometimes competing) goals may raise several policy questions for U.S. officials and Members of Congress, including  the makeup and viability of the Iraqi government; Iraqi leaders' approaches to Iran-backed groups and the future of militia forces mobilized to fight the Islamic State; Iraq's compliance with U.S. sanctions on Iran; the future extent and roles of the U.S. military presence in Iraq; the terms and conditions associated with U.S. security assistance to Iraqi forces; U.S. relations with Iraqi constituent groups such as the Kurds; and potential responses to U.S. efforts to contain or confront Iran-aligned entities in Iraq or elsewhere in the region."

67,"Morales initially supported the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which Guatemala asked the United Nations (U.N.) to form in 2007 to help the government combat corruption, human rights violations, and other crimes.
Many observers are concerned that Morales's efforts could undermine ongoing investigations by the Guatemalan attorney general's office and judicial proceedings, make political reform more difficult, and heighten instability in Guatemala.
In August and September 2017, Guatemala's attorney general and CICIG announced they were seeking to lift the president's immunity from prosecution as they investigated alleged violations of campaign finance laws and bonuses paid to him by the military.
Nonetheless, tensions have heightened as President Morales's efforts to impede CICIG have escalated, and the Guatemalan Congress has tried to reduce criminal penalties for corruption and human rights violations.
In January 2019, thousands of Guatemalans joined renewed public protests supporting CICIG and calling for the resignations of President Morales and members of Congress seen as protecting corrupt practices.
In February 2018, the Morales administration dismissed the three senior officials of the national police, saying it sought ""to generate more positive results to benefit citizen security and the fight against organized crime."" A wide range of people, including human rights activists and business leaders, expressed concern at their dismissal.
The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala congratulated Ramos just a few weeks before his dismissal for his team's work in reducing homicides by 10% compared to January 2017 and for the PNC's ""fight against corruption and to improve security throughout Guatemala."" In response to the high level of violence over many years, a number of municipalities asked for military troops to augment their ineffective police forces; the Guatemalan government has been using a constitutional clause to have the army ""temporarily"" support the police in combating crime.
Efforts to Combat Impunity and Corruption In what many observers see as a step forward in Guatemala's democratic development, the Public Ministry's corruption and human rights abuse investigations in recent years have led to the arrest and trial of high-level government, judicial, and military officials.
According to the State Department, current U.S. policy objectives in Guatemala include addressing the underlying drivers of illegal migration; supporting the institutionalization of democracy; encouraging respect for human rights and rule of law, and the efficient functioning of CICIG; supporting broad-based economic growth and sustainable development and maintaining mutually beneficial trade and commercial relations, including ensuring that benefits of CAFTA-DR reach all sectors of Guatemalan society; cooperating to fight money laundering, corruption, narcotics trafficking, alien smuggling, trafficking in persons, and other transnational crimes; supporting Central American integration through support for resolution of border and territorial disputes; reinforcing the government's economic development and political reform plan in the Alliance for Prosperity to be self-reliant in addressing drivers of migration and illicit trafficking of goods and people; and improving Guatemala's business climate."
68,"Board of Education , President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights had already sketched out the basic pattern for Title VI, calling for ""establishment by act of Congress or executive order"" of a federal office to review ""the expenditures of all government funds,"" so that none would go to subsidize discrimination based on race, color, creed, or national origin.
Banning Intentional Discrimination (Disparate Treatment) Despite Title VI's basic ambiguity, the courts have long agreed that, at a minimum, Section 601 bars federally funded programs from intentionally singling out individuals for adverse treatment because of their race.
Immediately after saying that they were ""rely[ing] solely on [Section] 601"" in siding with the student plaintiffs, the majority in Lau turned to recite a regulation issued by HEW, specifically addressing what recipient school districts had to do under Title VI to ensure students with ""linguistic deficiencies"" had the same ""opportunity to obtain the education generally obtained by other students in the system."" That discussion drew a contrasting concurrence from three other Justices, all of whom agreed that the student should prevail under a disparate impact theory, but believed that the proper basis for that theory—and the result in favor of the students—was HEW's regulation implementing Title VI, not Section 601 itself.
Civil Service Commission , the Court had at one time indicated—in a decision dating to ""the dawn of [the last] century""—that ""an administrative regulation's conformity to statutory authority was to be measured by the same standard as a statute's conformity to constitutional authority."" And as it happened, only a few years before Guardians , the Court had read the Fifteenth Amendment, despite ""only prohibit[ing] purposeful racial discrimination in voting,"" to allow ""Congress [to] implement that prohibition by banning voting practices that are discriminatory in effect."" Congress could do that, according to Justice Stevens, because the Fifteenth Amendment—much like Title VI—supplements its prohibition against racially discriminatory voting policies with a provision empowering Congress ""to enforce"" that prohibition ""by appropriate legislation."" Given the structural similarity between the amendment and Title VI, Justice Stevens saw no reason why Section 602 should give federal agencies any less authority than the Fifteenth Amendment offers Congress—including authority to outlaw policies with discriminatory effects."
69,"Citing ""circumstances in the region"" (an apparent reference to the Islamic State challenge and conflicts in Syria and Yemen), the Amir suspended the National Assembly and set new elections for November 26, 2016—earlier than planned.
Broader Human Rights Issues2 On broad human rights issues, the State Department identifies the principal human rights problems in Kuwait as allegations of torture of detainees; political prisoners; restrictions on freedom of speech, including criminalization of criticism of government officials and defamation of religion; limited rights for a stateless population referred to as Bidoon s ; trafficking in persons; criminalization of male same-sex sexual activity; and reports of forced labor, especially among foreign workers.
The National Endowment for Democracy, which obtains funds from the State Department, has in recent years given grants to Kuwaiti groups that promote civil society, human rights, women's rights, and the rights of noncitizens in Kuwait.
U.S.-Kuwait Relations and Defense Cooperation  Kuwait was not strategically or politically close to the United States until the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), when Kuwait—a backer of Iraq—sought U.S. help against Iranian attacks.
During a December 3-5, 2017, visit to Kuwait, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis said that the U.S.-Kuwait military relationship is ""very close."" The Amir has met with President Trump on three occasions, most recently September 5, 2018, focusing on regional issues including the U.S. concept of an anti-Iran Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA).
During a visit to Iraq by Kuwait's Prime Minister on June 12, 2013, the two countries agreed to take the issues of still-missing Kuwaitis and Kuwaiti property out of the Chapter 7 supervision of the United Nations and replace them with alternative mechanisms, as discussed below.
The June 16, 2013, visit of the Kuwaiti Prime Minister to Iraq—which followed progress on border demarcations issues—resulted in an Iraq-Kuwait joint recommendation to remove these issues of missing property and persons from the Chapter 7 U.N. mandate.
No GCC state deployed ground forces to Syria or Iraq, and Kuwaiti officials say the government does not fund or arm any rebel groups fighting in Syria."
70,"The report also provided statistics quantifying the scale of the conflict, which has taken a huge toll on Colombian society: more than 23,000 selective assassinations between 1981 and 2012; internal displacement of more than 5 million Colombians due to land seizure and violence; 27,000 kidnappings between 1970 and 2010; and 11,000 deaths or amputees from anti-personnel land mines laid primarily by Colombia's main insurgent guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
However, former paramilitaries joined armed groups (called criminal bands, or Bacrim, by the Colombian government) who continued to participate in the lucrative drug trade and commit other crimes and human rights abuses.
The AUC demobilization, combined with the stepped-up counternarcotics efforts of the Uribe administration and increased military victories against the FARC's irregular forces, helped to bring down violence, although a high level of human rights violations still plagued the country.
During his first two years in office, President Santos reorganized the executive branch and built on the market opening strategies of the Uribe administration and secured a free-trade agreement with the United States, Colombia's largest trade partner, which went into effect in May 2012.
The countries of Norway, Cuba, Venezuela, and Chile each held an international support role, with Norway and Cuba serving as peace talk hosts and ""guarantors."" Following the formal start in Norway, the actual negotiations began a month later in mid-November 2012 in Cuba, where the FARC-government talks continued until their conclusion in August 2016.
Although it is widely recognized that Colombia's efforts to reduce violence, combat drug trafficking and terrorism, and strengthen the economy have met with success, many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights groups continue to report significant human rights violations, including violence targeting noncombatants, that involves killings, torture, kidnappings, disappearances, forced displacements, forced recruitments, massacres, and sexual attacks.
For instance, 13 social leaders were assassinated in the southwest department of Cauca in the first six months of the year, a department in Colombia with the fourth largest area devoted to coca cultivation in the country and host to several peace accord programs associated with rural development, including voluntary eradication of drug crops.
The Bush Administration requested new flexibility so that U.S.-provided assistance would back a ""unified campaign against narcotics trafficking, terrorist activities, and other threats to [Colombia's] national security"" due to the breakdown of peace talks between the FARC and the Pastrana government in February 2002.
In 2007, the Uribe administration announced a shift to a ""Policy of Consolidation of Democratic Security."" The new doctrine was based on a ""whole-of-government"" approach to consolidate state presence in marginal areas that were historically neglected—vulnerable to drug crop cultivation, violence, and control by illegal armed groups.
Because of the large amount of security assistance provided to Colombian forces (including the military and police), the State Department reportedly vets more candidates for assistance in Colombia than in any other country.
Other Colombians maintain that support for peace programs in Colombia is important not only to benefit former FARC or other demobilized combatants but also to fulfill promises the government made in the peace accords to the country's 8.6 million victims of the five-decade conflict.
The annual level of foreign assistance provided by the U.S. Congress for Colombia began to decline in FY2008 and then gradually increased in FY2017 and FY2018 to support peace and implementation of the FARC-government peace accord."
71,"It also delayed the indexation of the two new tax brackets for one year and permanently extended the limitation on itemized deductions and the accelerated phaseout of the personal exemption from OBRA90.
Several other provisions of the act modified the tax brackets and limitations on personal exemptions and deductions for higher-income taxpayers.
OBRA90 eliminated the tax rate bubble created by TRA86, and replaced it with a limitation on itemized deductions and a new approach to phasing out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upper-income households.
Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003  JGTRRA accelerated several changes to the individual income tax rate structure that were first enacted under EGTRRA."

73,"In January 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) designated government programs designed to protect critical technologies, including the U.S. export control system, as a ""high-risk"" area warranting a ""strategic reexamination of existing programs to identify needed changes."" GAO's report named poor coordination among export control agencies, disagreements over commodity jurisdiction between the Departments of State and Commerce, unnecessary delays and inefficiencies in the license application process, and a lack of systematic evaluative mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of export controls.
The ECA requires the Secretary of Commerce to ""establish and maintain a list"" of controlled items and ""foreign persons and end-uses that are determined to be a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States""; require export licenses; ""prohibit unauthorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers of controlled items""; and ""monitor shipments and other means of transfer."" Administration The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce administers the export licensing and enforcement functions of the dual-use export control system.
These regulations also impose foreign policy controls on encryption items and on hot section technology, which is ""for the development, production, or overhaul of commercial aircraft engines, components, and systems."" The EAR include ""enhanced controls"" on hot section technology and require a license ""for exports and reexports to all destinations, except Canada."" The U.S. government reviews license applications for such technology ""on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the proposed export or reexport is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests."" Foreign policy-based controls are also based on adherence to multilateral nonproliferation control regimes, such as the Nuclear Suppliers' Group, the Australia Group (chemical and biological precursors), and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
The Four Singularities A Single Licensing Agency In his speech introducing the Administration's reform efforts, then-Secretary Gates described the bureaucratic structure of the U.S. export control system as a ""byzantine amalgam of authorities, roles, and missions scattered around different parts of the federal government."" As noted above, licensing is divided among the Department of Commerce for dual-use and certain military items, the Department of State for munitions, the Department of the Treasury for certain sanctions, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy for certain nuclear materials and technologies.
If they are not reclassified, the items ""are designated as EAR99 items unless either the CCL is amended to impose a control on such items under another ECCN or the ECCN 0Y521 classification is extended."" BIS may extend this classification ""for two one-year periods, provided that the U.S. Government has submitted a proposal to the relevant multilateral regime(s) to obtain multilateral controls over the item."" BIS may further extend the classification ""only if the Under Secretary for Industry and Security makes a determination that such extension is in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States."" According to the Obama Administration, the USML would contain ""only those items that provide at least a significant military or intelligence applicability that warrant the controls the AECA requires."" The reconstituted Munitions List may then be aligned with the CCL by adopting its A-E commodity organization structure and adding two additional categories: F and G for ITAR specific controls."
74,"Below are the two main approaches to regulating the adjustment of state minimum wage rates in states with rates above the federal minimum: legislatively scheduled increases and indexing to inflation.
Following the three-step increase in the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to the current $7.25 (2007-2009), 15 states, comprising 33% of the civilian labor force, had rates above the federal minimum wage in 2010."
75,"Representatives use offset amendments for a variety of reasons, including to (1) ensure that proposals increasing funding for certain activities in any appropriations measure do not violate parliamentary rules enforcing certain spending ceilings; (2) comply with the prohibition against increasing total spending in a general appropriations bill; (3) garner support for efforts to reduce funding for certain activities by transferring those funds to popular programs; and (4) provide a focal point for discussion of a particular issue.
The second rule, the 311(a) point of order, prohibits, in part, floor consideration of any committee-reported appropriations measure and related amendments providing new budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year that would cause the applicable total budget authority and outlay ceilings in the budget resolution for that fiscal year to be exceeded.
Reachback amendments must offset budget authority, but not necessarily outlays; may add new lump-sum appropriations and set-asides, subject to certain restrictions; may not include unauthorized appropriations; must be drafted to avoid a demand for a division of the question; and may provide across-the-board spending reductions as offsets."
76,"In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate drought and stretch basin water supplies and has considered new authorities for Reclamation to combat drought and enter into agreements with states and Colorado River contractors.
The act ratified the 1922 compact, authorized the construction of a federal facility to impound water in the Lower Basin (Boulder Dam, later renamed Hoover Dam) and related facilities to deliver water in Southern California (e.g., the All-American Canal, which delivers Colorado River water to California's Imperial Valley), and apportioned the Lower Basin's 7.5 MAF per year among the three Lower Basin states.
Congress's approval of the compact in the BCPA was conditioned on a number of factors, including ratification by California and five other states (thereby allowing the compact to become effective without Arizona's concurrence), and California agreeing by act of its legislature to limit its water use to 4.4 MAF per year and not more than half of any surplus waters.
It also directed that the Secretary of the Interior propose operational criteria for Colorado River Storage Project units (including the releases of water from Lake Powell) that prioritize (1) Treaty Obligations to Mexico, (2) the Colorado River Compact requirement for the Upper Basin to deliver 75 MAF to Lower Basin states over any 10-year period, and (3) carryover storage to meet these needs.
To achieve compliance under ESA, federal entities involved in managing water supplies in the Lower Colorado River met with resource agencies from Arizona, California, and Nevada; Native American Tribes; environmental groups; and recreation interests to develop a program to conserve species along a portion of the Colorado River."
77,"It amends SDWA to promote compliance with SDWA requirements, reauthorize appropriations for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, expand program eligibilities, increase emphasis on assisting disadvantaged communities, make SDWA compliance more affordable, and improve consumer confidence in public water supplies.
Title II also authorizes new grant programs to reduce lead contamination in school drinking water, assist small and disadvantaged communities, and develop public water system resilience, among other purposes.
This SDWA reauthorization bill would have authorized activities and revised existing law to improve water systems' technical, managerial, financial capacity, and consumer confidence and facilitate communities' access to financial assistance for drinking water infrastructure improvements.
The act is implemented through programs that (1) establish national primary drinking water regulations and monitoring and reporting requirements for contaminants present in water delivered by public water systems, (2) promote water system compliance through technical and financial assistance and capacity development programs, and (3) address public water systems' preparedness for emergencies.
These revisions expand the eligible uses of DWSRF financial assistance, provide states with additional flexibility to administer the DWSRF program, and include provisions intended to make DWSRF assistance more accessible to public water systems.
Section 2013 authorized $25.0 million to be appropriated each year for FY2020 and FY2021 for EPA to make grants to public water systems to plan or implement projects to address their system's resiliency."
78,"Introduction Including the first woman to serve in 1917, a total of 365 women have been elected or appointed to serve in the U.S. Congress.
In an exception to these incremental changes, the elections in 1992, which came to be known popularly as the ""Year of the Woman,"" represented a jump in the number of women in Congress."
79,"The bill would have, among other provisions, revised and enhanced requirements for federal agency notification of the Chief Counsel prior to the publication of any proposed rule; expanded the required use of small business advocacy review panels from three federal agencies to all federal agencies, including independent regulatory agencies; empowered the Chief Counsel to issue rules governing federal agency compliance with the RFA; specifically authorized the Chief Counsel to file comments on any notice of proposed rulemaking, not just when the RFA is concerned; and transferred size standard determinations for purposes other than the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 from the SBA's Administrator to the Chief Counsel.
2847 , the Prove It Act of 2016, which was reported by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, would have authorized the Chief Counsel to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to review any federal agency certification that a proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, is not required to submit a regulatory flexibility analysis of the rule."

81,"According to the JCPOA, Iran was to ""complete"" a series of steps set out in an Iran-IAEA ""Roadmap for Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues."" According to IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano, this road map set out ""a process"" under a November 24, 2013, Joint Plan of Action between Iran and the P5+1, ""to enable the Agency, with the cooperation of Iran, to make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme."" According to a December 2, 2015, report from Amano to the IAEA Board of Governors, ""[a]ll the activities contained in the road-map were implemented in accordance with the agreed schedule."" The road map required Amano to present this report, which contains the agency's ""final assessment on the resolution"" of the aforementioned outstanding issues.
This latter resolution requests the IAEA Director General ""to undertake the necessary verification and monitoring of Iran's nuclear-related commitments for the full duration of those commitments under the JCPOA."" The December 2015 IAEA resolution requests the Director General to issue quarterly reports to the board regarding Iran's ""implementation of its relevant commitments under the JCPOA for the full duration of those commitments."" The Director General is also to report to the Board of Governors and the Security Council ""at any time if the Director General has reasonable grounds to believe there is an issue of concern"" regarding Tehran's compliance with its JCPOA or safeguards obligations.
Several U.N. Security Council Resolutions required Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA's investigation of its nuclear activities, suspend its uranium enrichment program, suspend its construction of a heavy-water reactor and related projects, and ratify the Additional Protocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement.
According to the April 2018 State Department report  [t]he IAEA continues to exercise its full authorities in pursuing any new safeguards-relevant or JCPOA-related information in Iran, including any new concerns regarding weaponization should they arise, through implementation of Iran's Safeguards Agreement, Additional Protocol, and the enhanced transparency and verification measures contained in the JCPOA."

86,"Introduction Issues for Congress This report provides background information and issues for Congress on multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC), which are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs.
At least two things give the contractor confidence that DOD will not terminate an MYP contract and that the multiyear stream of business consequently will materialize: For a program to qualify for MYP, DOD must certify, among other things, that the minimum need for the items to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contract in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities.
In addition, 10 U.S.C. 2306b states the following: If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered into under this section is authorized by law for a particular procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain conditions established by law (including a condition as to cost savings to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that significant savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program.
A 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report stated the following: Although DOD had been entering into multiyear contracts on a limited basis prior to the 1980s, the Department of Defense Authorization Act, [for fiscal year] 1982, codified the authority for DOD to procure on a multiyear basis major weapon systems that meet certain criteria.
The lack of such a statute gives DOD and Congress full flexibility in determining when and how to use BBC for programs that may not qualify for MYP, but for which a multiyear contract of some kind might produce substantial savings."
87,"Congress subsequently mandated the expansion of integrity management to natural gas pipelines, along with other significant changes to federal pipeline safety requirements, through a series of agency budget reauthorizations as discussed below.
It also mandated a review of the adequacy of federal pipeline safety regulations related to internal corrosion control, and required PHMSA to increase the transparency of enforcement actions by issuing monthly summaries, including violation and penalty information, and a mechanism for pipeline operators to make response information available to the public.
According to the MOU, PHMSA agrees to promptly alert FERC when safety activities may impact commission responsibilities, notify FERC of major accidents or significant enforcement actions involving pipelines under FERC's jurisdiction, refer to FERC complaints and inquiries by state and local governments and the public about environmental or certificate matters related to FERC-jurisdictional pipelines, and when requested by FERC, review draft mitigation conditions considered by the commission for potential conflicts with PHMSA's regulations.
These recommendations included the following: conducting audits to assess the effectiveness of PHMSA's oversight of performance-based pipeline safety programs and state pipeline safety program certification, requiring pipeline operators to provide system-specific information to the emergency response agencies of the communities in which pipelines are located, requiring that automatic shutoff valves or remote control valves be installed in high consequence areas and in class 3 and 4 locations, requiring that all natural gas transmission pipelines constructed before 1970 be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test that incorporates a pressure spike test, requiring that all natural gas transmission pipelines be configured so as to accommodate internal inspection tools, with priority given to older pipelines, and revising PHMSA's integrity management protocol to incorporate meaningful metrics, set performance goals for pipeline operators, and require operators to regularly assess the effectiveness of their programs using meaningful metrics.
The NTSB issued eight recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation and PHMSA, including auditing the business practices of PHMSA's onshore pipeline facility response plan programs, including reviews of response plans and drill programs, to correct deficiencies, allocating sufficient resources to ensure that PHMSA's facility response plan program meets all of the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, clarifying and strengthening federal regulation related to the identification and repair of pipeline crack defects, issuing advisory bulletins to all hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline operators describing the circumstances of the accident in Marshall, asking them to take appropriate action to eliminate similar deficiencies, to identify deficiencies in facility response plans, and to update these plans as necessary, developing requirements for team training of control center staff involved in pipeline operations similar to those used in other transportation modes, strengthening operator qualification requirements, and harmonizing onshore oil pipeline response planning requirements with those of the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for oil and petroleum products facilities to ensure that operators have adequate resources for worst-case discharges.

89,"U.S. Assistance11 According to the State Department's FY2019 foreign aid budget request, South Africa is a key player for U.S. engagement in Africa and a critical partner to boost U.S. trade and economic growth, improve regional security, and mitigate public health crises.
South Africa is the economic and security anchor of the region but grapples with political and socioeconomic challenges, including high-level corruption and poor accountability, a slowing economy, high youth unemployment, critical levels of violent crime, a weak education system, a high rate of HIV/AIDS, water scarcity, and wildlife trafficking.
Since 1994, South Africa has been a top African recipient of U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) aid, the vast majority devoted to PEPFAR and other health programs, including responses to the tuberculosis epidemic and efforts to end child and maternal deaths.
The State Department has proposed to cut PEPFAR funding by 67.6% in FY2020, to $161.8 million, after issuing sharp criticism of the PEPFAR in South Africa in its FY2019 PEPFAR Country Operational Plan ""Planning Level Letter."" While praising a number of successes under the U.S. PEPFAR partnership with the South African government and commending efforts to improve the program, the letter, by U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy Deborah L.
Birx, took note of ""several fundamental problems in PEPFAR's core treatment program in South Africa."" The letter stated Despite a significant infusion of resources by the U.S. government especially over the last three years, progress has been grossly sub-optimal and insufficient to reach epidemic control, including the targets of the Surge Plan [an effort to accelerate HIV testing, treatment, and retention].
Other recent-year U.S. development aid for South Africa has supported programs focusing on basic education; civil society capacity-building aimed at fostering accountable and responsive governance and public service delivery advocacy, and support for the office of the Public Protector [a public ombudsman; see below]; business-government cooperation in support of development; and support for sexual assault and gender-based-violence victims.
USAID also administers the Trilateral Assistance Program (discussed below), under which the United States supports South African foreign aid efforts in Africa.
South Africa also participates in the joint State Department/USAID Young African Leaders Initiative, which helps develop the leadership skills of young business, civic, and public sector professionals.
South Africa has a generally open foreign direct investment (FDI) regime, although investors face high taxes, currency exchange volatility, substantial regulatory burdens, large locally entrenched firms, and Black Economic Empowerment policy compliance costs (see below)."

91,"Over one-third of all FHA loans (both purchase and refinance loans) were obtained by minority households, and FHA-insured mortgages accounted for about 57% of all forward mortgages made to low- or moderate-income borrowers during the year.
FHA increased the actual annual premiums that it charges several times in recent years in order to bring more money into the FHA insurance fund and ensure that it has sufficient funds to pay for defaulted loans.
The MMI Fund has historically been estimated to generate negative credit subsidy in the year that the loans are insured and therefore has not required appropriations to cover the expected costs of loans to be insured."
92,"The President's request includes continued R&D funding for existing single-agency and multiagency programs and activities, as well as new initiatives.
Under the request, eight federal agencies would receive more than 97% of total federal R&D funding in FY2020: the Department of Defense, 44.3%; Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), primarily the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 25.1%; Department of Energy (DOE), 11.0%; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 8.4%; National Science Foundation (NSF), 4.3%; Department of Agriculture (USDA), 1.8%; Department of Commerce (DOC), 1.3%; and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 1.0%.
In the President's FY2020 budget request, the Department of Health and Human Services, primarily NIH, would account for nearly half (47.7%) of all federal funding for basic research.
The Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) (P.L. 101-606) requires each federal agency or department involved in global change research to report annually to Congress on each element of its proposed global change research activities, as well as the portion of its budget request allocated to each element of the program.
In addition, in almost each of the past 17 years, language in appropriations laws has required the President to submit a comprehensive report to the appropriations committees ""describing in detail all Federal agency funding, domestic and international, for climate change programs, projects, and activities … including an accounting of funding by agency…."" The President's most recent report was submitted in January 2017 for the FY2017 request.
President Trump's FY2020 budget request would provide NIH a total program level of $34.368 billion, a decrease of $4.941 billion (12.6%) compared with FY2019 enacted levels.
The Administration's FY2020 budget request for DOE includes about $12.783 billion for R&D and related activities, including programs in three broad categories: science, national security, and energy.
NSF has six appropriations accounts: Research and Related Activities (RRA, the main research account), Education and Human Resources (EHR, the main education account), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM), the National Science Board (NSB), and the Office of Inspector General (OIG).
The enacted bill provides $259.0 million to support Hatch Act formula funding for 1862 land grant university research and education activities.
Table 21 at the end of this section includes the President's FY2020 request for program areas and activities within EPA's S&T account as presented in EPA's FY20 20 Congressional Budget Justification compared to the FY2019 enacted appropriations as reported in the Conference Report ( H.Rept.

94,"Governance, Human Rights, and Reform The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates (principalities): Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich federation capital; Dubai, a large commercial hub; and the five smaller and less wealthy emirates of Sharjah, Ajman, Fujayrah, Umm al-Qaywayn, and Ras al-Khaymah.
U.S. officials assert that they continue to promote democracy, rule of law, independent media, and civil society in the UAE through State Department programs that are tolerated by the UAE government.
The 2018 State Department report credits the UAE with implementing reforms that reduce forced labor among foreign workers in the private sector, instituting direct governmental oversight of domestic laborers, increasing the number of labor trafficking prosecutions, and funding and implementing a national action plan to combat trafficking in persons.
Its assertiveness has been enhanced by the training, arms, and advice the country has received from its close security partnership with the United States, forged during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war and strengthened after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The UAE and the five other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman) also have close defense ties to the United States.
The rift has scuttled long-standing GCC plans to establish a joint military command and joint naval force to be based in Bahrain, supported by an Abu Dhabi-based ""Gulf Academy for Strategic and Security Studies."" Saudi Arabia, possibly as an overture, formally invited the Amir of Qatar to the GCC summit of December 7-9, 2018, but the Amir did not attend.
Criticism of the Arab coalition war effort has produced increasing congressional opposition to the U.S. logistical support provided to the effort, which included intelligence and aerial refueling under a cross-servicing agreement, as well as related arms sales and some direct U.S. military action to prevent Iranian weapons flows to the Houthis.
Defense Cooperation with the United States  The UAE's ability to project power in the region is a product of many years of U.S.-UAE defense cooperation that includes U.S. arms sales and training, strategic planning, and joint exercises and operations.
Within a broader GCC context, joint statements issued after a 2015 and a 2016 U.S.-GCC summit at Camp David announced a new U.S.-GCC strategic partnership in which the United States pledged to (1) facilitate U.S. arms transfers to the GCC states; (2) increase U.S.-GCC cooperation on maritime security, cybersecurity, and counterterrorism; (3) organize additional large-scale joint military exercises and U.S. training; (4) help realize a long-discussed concept of a Gulf-wide ballistic missile defense capability; and (5) U.S.-GCC military exercises and U.S. training for GCC special forces.
UAE authorities have arrested and prosecuted Al Qaeda and Islamic State operatives; denounced terror attacks; improved border security; instituted programs to counter violent extremism; instituted laws to block suspect financial transactions; criminalized use of the internet by terrorist groups; and strengthened its bureaucracy and legal framework to combat terrorism."
95,"Other state laws, known as per se laws, provide that a driver is automatically guilty of driving while impaired if specified levels of a potentially impairing substance are found in his or her body (e.g., blood alcohol content (BAC) of .08% or higher, or, in some states, THC in the blood; see Table 1 ).
There is as yet no scientifically demonstrated correlation between levels of THC and degrees of impairment of driver performance, and epidemiological studies disagree as to whether marijuana use by a driver results in increased crash risk.
Other studies have estimated the increased crash risk for drivers testing positive for marijuana at between zero and three times that for unimpaired drivers, roughly comparable to the increased crash risk of having a blood alcohol content of between .01% and .05%, well below the legal per se impaired level of .08 BAC."
96,"Currently administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the program provides federal grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs.
829 as passed by the Senate; and H.R. 1571 , the Fire Department Proper Response and Equipment Prioritization Act, which was introduced by Representative Herrera-Beutler and would amend the FIRE Act statute to direct FEMA to give high-priority consideration to grants providing for planning, training, and equipment to firefighters for crude oil-by-rail and ethanol-by-rail derailment and incident response.
Table 2 shows the appropriations history for firefighter assistance, including AFG, SAFER, and the Fire Station Construction Grants (SCG) provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)."
97,"The most general and direct protection of individual privacy is contained in the Fourth Amendment, which states that ""[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated .
Carpenter distinguished earlier cases which had relied upon the principle that information shared with third parties was generally not subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny, concluding that ""an individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy in the record of his physical movements as captured through [his cellular phone]."" The Court's holding means that, in the future, the government must obtain a warrant supported by probable cause to obtain this information.
Under this doctrine, only government action is subject to scrutiny under the Constitution, but purely private conduct is not proscribed, ""no matter how unfair that conduct may be."" As a result, neither the common nor constitutional law provides a complete framework for considering many of the potential threats to digital privacy and consumer data.
The Department of Justice has criminal enforcement authority and may seek fines or imprisonment against a person who, in violation of HIPAA's privacy requirements, ""knowingly"" obtains or discloses ""individually identifiable health information"" or ""uses or causes to be used a unique health identifier."" HIPAA does not, however, contain a private right of action that would allow aggrieved individuals to sue alleged violators.
The privacy and security requirements imposed on entities acting as common carriers are primarily centered on a category of information referred to as ""customer proprietary network information (CPNI)."" CPNI is defined as information relating to the ""quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of a telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer of a telecommunications carrier,"" and is ""made available to the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship.""  Section 222(c) of the Communications Act and the FCC's implementing regulations set forth carriers' obligations regarding CPNI.
Cable Operators and Satellite Carriers In addition to common carriers, the Communications Act imposes a number of data privacy and security requirements on how ""cable operators"" and ""satellite carriers"" (i.e., covered entities) treat their subscribers' ""personally identifiable information"" (PII).
Additionally, covered entities violating these provisions may be subject to FCC civil enforcement and criminal penalties that, as previously noted, are generally applicable to violations of the Communications Act. Video Privacy Protection Act The Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) was enacted in 1988 in order to ""preserve personal privacy with respect to the rental, purchase, or delivery of video tapes or similar audio visual materials."" The VPPA does not have any data security provisions requiring entities to maintain safeguards to protect consumer information from unauthorized access.
The VPPA does not empower any federal agency to enforce violations of the Act and there are no criminal penalties for violations, but it does provide for a private right of action for persons aggrieved by the Act. In such actions, courts may award actual damages, punitive damages, preliminary and equitable relief, and reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation costs.
Among other things, these additional procedures require the FTC to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), give interested persons an opportunity for an informal hearing, and issue a statement accompanying the rule regarding the ""prevalence of the acts or practices treated by the rule."" Consequently, the FTC rarely uses its TRR rulemaking authority and has not enacted any TRRs regarding data protection.
Other legislative proposals have sought to avoid dual layers of regulations by stating that the proposed data protection requirements would not apply to individuals or entities covered by certain existing federal privacy laws."
98,"In addition, Executive Order (E.O.) 13783 has directed EPA and other federal agencies to review existing regulations and policies that ""potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources"" for consistency with policies that the E.O. enumerates, and as soon as practicable, to ""suspend, revise, or rescind the guidance, or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding those rules."" EPA rules to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants, cars and trucks, and the oil and gas sector have been of particular interest.
EPA finalized GHG standards for power plants in August 2015; set GHG emission standards for oil and gas industry sources in June 2016; finalized a second round of GHG standards for trucks in August 2016; and completed a Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) of the already promulgated GHG standards for model years 2022-2025 light-duty vehicles (cars and light trucks) in January 2017.
New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new and modified power plants, promulgated at the same time as the CPP, would affect fewer plants, but they too are controversial, because of the technology the rule assumed could be used to reduce emissions at new coal-fired units.
While neither ACE nor the 2018 NSPS rule proposes to reconsider the endangerment finding or the conclusions related to the endangerment finding in the 2015 NSPS, the 2018 NSPS requested comments on these issues, ""either as a general matter or specifically applied to GHG emissions."" For example, EPA noted that power sector GHG emissions are declining and requested comment on whether EPA has ""a rational basis for regulating CO 2 emissions from new coal-fired"" units.
Similarly, H.R. 1152 would, among other things, require EPA to revise the MON and commercial sterilization NESHAPs within 180 days, and to base the revision on an EPA report, ""Evaluation of the Inhalation Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide.""  Mercury from Power Plants  EPA is reviewing the benefit-cost analysis it prepared in 2011 for the Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS) rule, raising questions about whether the agency will take additional action on the rulemaking in 2019."
99,"In the lead-up to the first funding gap, only 3 out of the 13 regular appropriations acts had been signed into law, and budget authority, which had been provided by a CR since the start of the fiscal year, expired at the end of the day on November 13."
100,"According to one Jordanian commentator, ""Domestically, the King's decision is a much-needed shot in the arm for the government at a time when it is facing public pressure over its unpopular economic policies."" Several months later, Jordan expanded the membership of the Islamic Waqf Council (Islamic custodial trust), which Jordan appoints to oversee the administration of Jerusalem's Temple Mount (known by Muslims as the Haram al Sharif or Noble Sanctuary) and its holy sites.
Educated largely in Britain and the United States, King Abdullah II had earlier pursued a military career, ultimately serving as commander of Jordan's Special Operations Forces with the rank of major general.
Economic Assistance The United States provides economic aid to Jordan for (1) budgetary support (cash transfer), (2) USAID programs in Jordan, and (3) loan guarantees."
101,"A draft framework, in which the Taliban would prohibit terrorist groups from operating on Afghan soil in return for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces, was reached between U.S. and Taliban negotiators in January 2019, though lead U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad insists that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."" Negotiations do not, as of May 2019, directly involve representatives of the Afghan government, leading some to worry that the United States will prioritize a military withdrawal over a complex political settlement that preserves some of the social, political, and humanitarian gains made since 2001.
The United States has contributed approximately $133 billion in various forms of aid to Afghanistan over the past decade and a half, from building up and sustaining the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) to economic development."
102,"In his May 28, 2004, report following the vote, Annan said that ""the Greek Cypriots' vote must be respected, but they need to demonstrate willingness to resolve the Cyprus problem through a bicommunal, bizonal federation and to articulate their concerns about security and implementation of the Plan with 'clarity and finality.'"" The Christofias-Talat Negotiations: 2008-2010 As early as 2004, Talat, as Turkish Cypriot ""prime minister,"" was credited with helping convince the Turkish Cypriots to support the Annan Plan and had been seen as perhaps the one Turkish Cypriot leader who could move the Greek Cypriots toward a more acceptable solution for both sides.
After Christofias's election, Turkish Cypriot leader Talat, a long-time acquaintance of Christofias, declared that ""a solution in Cyprus is possible by the end of 2008."" He also declared that ""the goal was to establish a new partnership state in Cyprus, based on the political equality of the two peoples and the equal status of two constituent states."" While the negotiations between Christofias and Talat appeared to get off to a fast start, the differences in positions quickly became apparent, and the talks, although held on a regular basis, soon began to bog down.
Almost immediately, a controversy arose when it was reported that Downer read a statement from U.N. Secretary-General Ban congratulating the parties for starting the talks again from where they left off (including the confirmation of existing convergences agreed to by Christofias and Talat), for agreeing to abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions on Cyprus, and for suggesting that a final agreement could be reached in the coming months.
""As time passes,"" he said, ""the willingness of the two communities to live together is diminishing."" For his part, Christofias told the U.N. Secretary-General in September 2010 that both sides were not coming closer to a settlement and that Turkey, given its own domestic and regional problems, ""was not ready to solve the Cyprus problem."" Although assessments of the negotiations appeared to grow more pessimistic, additional sessions were held through the end of December.
Ban had asked both Christofias and Eroglu to come to New York on January 22-24 with significant offers in the areas of governance, economy, and EU affairs so that the ""Greentree 2"" meeting could facilitate a final deal that would allow the U.N. to convene an international conference in the spring to resolve security-related issues and allow referenda on a final agreement in both the north and south by early summer of 2012.
While foreclosing new discussions based on the old Annan Plan, Anastasiades had suggested that the basis of future talks would have to be broad understandings reached in 1977 and 1979 between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leadership at the time as well as a 2006 set of principles agreed to by former Cypriot leaders.
On the other hand, Yiannakis Omirou, then-leader of the parliament, stated that a new national policy was necessary: ""We need to denounce the Turkish stance to the international and European community and redefine the Cyprus problem as a problem of invasion, occupation and violation of international law."" The new policy, Omirou went on, ""must set out the framework for a Cyprus solution and use Cyprus's EU membership and Turkey's EU prospects to exert pressure on Ankara to terminate the island's occupation and accept a solution, in accordance with international and European law."" Initially, the Turkish Cypriots appeared cautious about which negotiating partner they expected to see across the table if and when the talks resumed.
The suspension of the talks, precipitated for some by an unnecessary action and a possible overreaction, again raised serious doubts regarding the commitment of both sides to achieve a solution that left one former British foreign secretary stating that ""the international community should accept the reality that there is division and that you have partition.""  Through the first four months of 2015, the talks remained in suspension with Anastasiades continuing to hold that Turkey would have to withdraw its seismic ship, rescind the NAVTEX issued in January, and stop threatening existing energy exploration activities off the southern coast of Cyprus.
For instance, in early September 2015 several Greek Cypriot political parties officially rejected the notion of a bizonal, bicommunal federation as a part of the solution to the Cyprus problem and criticized reported convergences on population size in the north, the rotating presidency, and particularly Turkey's security role.
Ankara's decision led some to wonder if its presence at Geneva was merely intended to reinforce Akinci's earlier demands that Anastasiades agree to such a conference or to demonstrate that Turkey, despite Greek Cypriot claims that Ankara was not interested in a solution, was indeed willing to continue negotiations.
The Geneva meetings apparently began on a positive note with what was reported to be a convergence on the sticking point of a rotating presidency and even more public references to a ""United Federal Cyprus."" Nevertheless, on January 11, 2017, when both sides presented their proposed maps for territorial adjustment to the U.N., the negotiations appeared to veer off course.
Following the announcement of the new conference in Crans Montana, U.N. Special Adviser Eide contacted officials of Greece, Turkey, the UK, and the two Cypriot parties to collect the ""bottom line"" positions of all sides on the security guarantee and troop level issues.
President Anastasiades indicated that he was ready to resume the negotiations, and, despite Guterres's assertion that this was not the end of the road, several news outlets reported that comments by Turkish Foreign Minister Cavusoglu suggested a Turkish decision to abandon the U.N. framework (bizonal, bicommunal federation) as a solution to the Cyprus problem and to move on to a ""Plan B."" Several in the Turkish Cypriot government also echoed the theme that negotiations under the current U.N. structure were over.
In May 2018, Akinci, despite his earlier comments regarding a new format for the talks, suggested negotiations could possibly resume from where they left off at Crans Montana if both sides agreed to adopt as a strategic agreement the six-point framework presented by U.N. Secretary-General Guterres on June 30, 2017.
This time, however, the Secretary-General tasked Lute to determine during her consultations whether there were grounds for the two leaders to accept what Guterres referred to as a ""terms of reference"" document that would include his original 2017 six-point framework, those issues on which both sides previously agreed ""convergences"" had been reached, and a road map for when and how new negotiations would be launched."
103,"The LCS program has been controversial over the years due to past cost growth, design and construction issues with the first LCSs, concerns over the survivability of LCSs (i.e., their ability to withstand battle damage), concerns over whether LCSs are sufficiently armed and would be able to perform their stated missions effectively, and concerns over the development and testing of the modular mission packages for LCSs. The LCS program has been modified or restructured several times over the years, in part to address these issues.
Supporters of this perspective might argue that the costs of the rapid acquisition strategy are not offset by very much in terms of a true reduction in acquisition cycle time, because the first LCS to be equipped with a mission package that had reached IOC (initial operational capability) did not occur until late FY2014—almost 13 years after the LCS program was announced."
104,"Data fro m streamgages informs real-time decisionmaking and long-term planning on issues such as hazard preparations and response, infrastructure design, water use allocations, ecosystem management, and recreation.
The proposed program was to be fully federally funded, conduct intense data collection during floods and droughts, provide regional and national assessments of streamflow characteristics, enhance information delivery, and conduct methods development and research.
The law also directed the program to determine the relationship between long-term streamflow dynamics and climate change, to incorporate principals of adaptive management to assess program objectives, and to integrate data collection activities of other federal agencies (i.e., NOAA's National Drought Information System) and appropriate state water resource agencies.
The FY2020 budget request states that ""one of the highest goals of the USGS is to maintain long-term stability of a 'Federal needs backbone network' for long-term tracking and forecasting/modeling of streamflow conditions."" Some stakeholders may advocate to maintain the current network as it provides hydrologic information for diverse applications (see section on "" Streamgage Uses "").
Congress may also consider if other federal agencies and nonfederal cooperative partners could provide more funding for FPSs. These entities may not be interested in financing some of the designated streamgages in the FPS network, particularly those in isolated river basins with little anthropogenic activity."
105,"This is followed by a description of a 2015 USDA rule—released subsequent to the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 )—that clarifies what constitutes AEF for nonfamily members of a farming operation, how more than one nonfamily person may qualify as an active farm manager (subject to a limit of three farm managers), and the recordkeeping requirements necessary to meet this new criteria.
Critics contend that current USDA eligibility criteria—especially for providing active personal management—remain broad and subjective and may represent a low threshold to qualify for payments, thus facilitating the creation of partnership members to increase the farm business's payment limit and expand its farm payment receipts.
The resulting USDA rule, published on December 16, 2015, specifies how legal entities comprised, either entirely or in part, of nonfamily members may be determined eligible for payments, based on a contribution of active personal management."
106,"In April 2015, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution (UNSCR) 2216 demanding that Houthi-Saleh forces end their use of violence and that all Yemeni parties avoid ""further unilateral actions that could undermine the political transition in Yemen."" The United States agreed to provide limited assistance to the coalition military operations, assistance which has evolved over time in response to conditions in the conflict and in light of congressional scrutiny.
The United States will continue to press the coalition and the Republic of Yemen government to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country."" In early February 2019, CENTCOM Commander General Joseph Votel testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding the U.S. role in assisting Saudi Arabia.
The foreign ministers comprising the quad also ""expressed full support for Saudi Arabia and its legitimate national security concerns and called for an immediate end to such attacks by Houthi forces and their allies."" On February 13, 2019, the House passed (248-177) H.J.Res. 37 , a joint resolution ""Directing the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress."" Prior to its passage by the House, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy in which the Administration argued that ""the premise of the joint resolution is flawed"" because the United States has provided only ""limited support to member countries of the Saudi-led coalition"" and U.S. forces providing such intelligence and logistics support are not engaged in hostilities."
107,"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated for emergencies or OCO/GWOT in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities.
Shift from Emergency Supplementals to Contingency Funding Congress used supplemental appropriations to provide funds for defense and foreign affairs activities related to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq following 9/11, and each subsequent fiscal year through FY2010.
By designating funding for OCO for certain activities not directly related to contingency operations, Congress and the President can effectively continue to increase topline defense, foreign affairs, and other related discretionary spending without triggering sequestration.
There's no pretense that it has anything to do with the region."" Others have argued it makes sense for the military to use OCO funding to purchase new aircraft to replace planes used in current conflicts and no longer in production: ""What are the conditions that are making the combatant commanders and those with train/equip authority to say, 'We need more of this?'"" GWOT/OCO Appropriations by Agency, FY2001-FY2019 Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority for war-related and other international emergency or contingency-designated activities since 9/11.
The Obama Administration's FY2012 International Affairs budget request was the first to include a request for OCO funds for ""extraordinary and temporary costs of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan."" At the time, the Administration indicated that the use of this designation was intended to provide a transparent, whole-of-government approach to the exceptional war-related costs incurred in those three countries, thus better aligning the associated military and civilian costs."
108,"For example, it provides education programs to assist with business formation and expansion; loan guaranty programs to enhance small business owners' access to capital; and programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting, including oversight of the service-disabled veteran-owned small business federal procurement goaling program.
The program consists of a two-day introductory course on entrepreneurship followed by an eight-week, online course to prepare servicemenmbers and military spouses ""for post-service career success as business owners."" Congress provided the SBA's OVBD an additional $7 million in FY2014 to expand the Boots to Business initiative ""nationwide to the 250,000 yearly transitioning servicemembers in all branches of the military."" The initiative's two-day Introduction to Entrepreneurship course is currently offered at 213 military institutions worldwide and is ""a standard portion of the curricula offered at the revised Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to servicemembers."" TAP is administered by the Department of Defense (DOD) in cooperation with the Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Education (DOE), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the SBA.
In addition, the SBA's OVBD administers several programs to assist veteran-owned businesses, including the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities Consortium of Universities, which provides ""experiential training in entrepreneurship and small business management to post-9/11 veterans with disabilities"" at eight universities; the Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship (V-WISE) program, administered through a cooperative agreement with Syracuse University, which offers women veterans a 15-day, online course focused on entrepreneurship skills and the ""language of business,"" followed by a 3-day conference (offered twice a year at varying locations) in which participants ""are exposed to successful entrepreneurs and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and leaders in government"" and participate in courses on business planning, marketing, accounting and finance, operations and production, human resources, and work-life balance; the Operation Endure and Grow Program, administered through a cooperative agreement with Syracuse University, which offers an eight-week online training program ""focused on the fundamentals of launching and/or growing a small business"" and is available to National Guard members and reservists and their family members; the Boots to Business initiative, which is ""an elective track within the Department of Defense's revised Training Assistance Program called Transition Goals, Plans, Success (Transition GPS) and has three parts: the Entrepreneurship Track Overview —a 10-minute introductory video shown during the mandatory five-day Transition GPS course which introduces entrepreneurship as a post-service career option; Introduction to Entrepreneurship —a two-day classroom course on entrepreneurship and business fundamentals offered as one of the three Transition GPS elective tracks; and Foundations of Entrepreneurship —an eight-week, instructor-led online course that offers in-depth instruction on the elements of a business plan and tips and techniques for starting a business""; the Boots to Business: Reboot initiative, which expanded the Boots to Business initiative in 2014 to include veterans of all eras, active duty servicemembers (including National Guard and Reserves), and their partner/spouse; the Veterans Institute for Procurement (VIP) program, which is designed to increase the ability of veteran-owned businesses to win government contracts by providing ""an accelerator-like, in-residence educational training program for owners, principals, and executives of veteran-owned businesses, consisting of a three-day comprehensive certification program instructed by professional service experts, government officials, and agency representatives""; and the VBOC program, which provides veterans and their spouse management and technical assistance training at 22 locations, including assistance with the Boots to Business initiatives, the development and maintenance of a five-year business plan, and referrals to other SBA resource partners when appropriate for additional training or mentoring services.
It also required the SBA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with SCORE to, among other things, establish ""a program to coordinate counseling and training regarding entrepreneurship to veterans through the chapters of SCORE throughout the United States."" In addition, it directed the SBA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with small business development centers, the VA, and the National Veterans Business Development Corporation ""with respect to entrepreneurial assistance to veterans, including service-disabled veterans."" The act specified that the following services were to be provided: (1) Conducting of studies and research, and the distribution of information generated by such studies and research, on the formation, management, financing, marketing, and operation of small business concerns by veterans.

As mentioned previously, the OVBD provides, or supports third parties to provide, management and technical assistance training services to more than 100,000 veterans each year."
109,"Introduction and Background The federal child nutrition programs provide assistance to schools and other institutions in the form of cash, commodity food, and administrative support (such as technical assistance and administrative funding) based on the provision of meals and snacks to children.
Unless stated otherwise, participation and funding data come from USDA-FNS's ""Keydata Reports.""  Authorization and Reauthorization The child nutrition programs are most often dated back to the 1946 enactment of the National School Lunch Act, which created the National School Lunch Program, albeit in a different form than it operates today.
At the state level, education, health, social services, and agriculture departments all have roles; at a minimum, they are responsible for approving and overseeing local providers such as schools, summer program sponsors, and child care centers and day care homes, as well as making sure they receive the federal support they are due.
Cash Reimbursements and Commodity Foods In the meal service programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, summer programs, and assistance for child care centers and day care homes, federal aid is provided in the form of statutorily set subsidies (reimbursements) paid for each meal/snack served that meets federal nutrition guidelines.
The subsidized meals are served by both public and private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools and residential child care institutions (RCCIs) that opt to enroll and guarantee to offer free or reduced-price meals to eligible low-income children.
(Although this report focuses on the programs that serve children, one child nutrition program (CACFP) also serves day care centers for chronically impaired adults and elderly persons under the same general per-meal/snack subsidy terms.) The programs in the sections to follow serve comparatively fewer children and spend comparatively fewer federal funds than the school meal programs."
110,"The United States plays a significant role in the world oil market, not only as the top consumer of crude oil and petroleum products, but also as the largest producer.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that the United States surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's number one crude oil producer in 2018.
Congress may consider policies that affect the world oil market, including sanctions, alternative fuel standards, emission controls, use of electric vehicles, and protection of international trade routes.
The United States, both the top oil producer and the world's greatest consumer of crude oil and petroleum products (e.g., gasoline), remains a net oil importer.
In addition to economic growth or decline, the world oil supply is influenced by a number of drivers, including project investments, the price of oil, demand forecasts, and geopolitics.
The IEA projects the United States, Norway, Brazil, and Canada to provide the largest new non-OPEC crude exports to the world market."
111,"ACF administers most FVPSA programming, including grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes to support local organizations that provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their children.
FVPSA was the first federal law to address domestic violence, with a focus on providing shelter and services for survivors; however, since the enactment of VAWA in 1994, the federal response to domestic violence has expanded to involve multiple departments and activities that include investigating and prosecuting crimes and providing additional services to victims and abusers.
FVPSA requires that the hotline provide information and assistance to adult and youth victims of domestic violence, family and household members of victims of such violence, and ""persons affected by victimization."" This includes support related to domestic violence, children exposed to domestic violence, sexual assault, intervention programs for abusive partners, and related issues.
Overview of Shelter, Services, and Support Funding for shelter, support services, and program support (hereinafter, shelter and services) encompasses multiple activities: formula grants to states and territories; grants to tribes; state domestic violence coalitions; national and special issue resource centers, including those that provide technical assistance; specialized services for abused parents and children exposed to domestic violence; and program support and administration.
In funding subgrantees, states must ""give special emphasis"" to supporting community-based projects of ""demonstrated effectiveness"" carried out by nonprofit organizations that operate shelters for victims of domestic violence and their dependents; or that provide counseling, advocacy, and self-help services to victims.
Multiple FVPSA activities address children exposed to domestic and related violence: One of the purposes of the formula grant program for states is to provide specialized services (e.g., counseling, advocacy, and other assistance) for these children."

113,"Although the President's budget request, the House committee-reported HUD appropriations bill, and the Senate bill all included different funding levels for voucher renewals for FY2019, each purported to provide enough to fund all vouchers currently in use."
114,"Introduction The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).
In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by federal dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve."
115,"The State Department stated that ""observers considered [the municipal council elections] free and fair."" Human Rights Issues7 Recent State Department reports identify the most significant human rights problems in the country as limits on the ability of citizens to choose their government in free and fair elections; restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association, including prohibitions on political parties and labor unions; restrictions on the rights of expatriate workers; and criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual activity.
In 2013-2014, differences over this and other issues widened to the point where Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors from Doha in March 2014, accusing Qatar of supporting ""terrorism."" The Ambassadors returned in November 2014 in exchange for a reported pledge by Qatar to fully implement a November 2013 ""Riyadh Agreement"" that committed Qatar to noninterference in the affairs of other GCC states and to refrain from supporting Muslim Brotherhood-linked organizations.
On June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain, joined by Egypt and a few other Muslim countries, severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, expelled Qatar's diplomats, recalled their ambassadors, and imposed limits on the entry and transit of Qatari nationals and vessels in their territories, waters, and airspace.
On June 22, 2017, the Saudi-led group presented Qatar with 13 demands, including closing Al Jazeera, severing relations with the Muslim Brotherhood, scaling back relations with Iran, closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, and paying reparations for its actions.
On June 14, 2017, the United States and Qatar signed an agreement for a reported 36 of the F-15 fighters, which predated (and therefore were not covered by) then-Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Bob Corker's June 26, 2017 announcement that he would not provide informal concurrence to arms sales to the GCC countries until the intra-GCC rift was resolved.
Perhaps in part as a means to attract U.S. support in the context of the intra-GCC rift, on July 10, 2017, Qatar's foreign minister and then-Secretary Tillerson signed in Doha a Memorandum of Understanding on broad U.S.-Qatar counterterrorism cooperation, including but going beyond just combatting terrorism financing.
According to the State Department's report on international terrorism for 2015, entities and individuals within Qatar continue to serve as a source of financial support for terrorist and violent extremist groups, particularly regional Al Qa'ida affiliates such as the Nusrah Front."" The State Department report for 2017 stated: ""While the Government of Qatar has made progress on countering the financing of terrorism, terrorist financiers within the country are still able to exploit Qatar's informal financial system."" The United States has imposed sanctions on several persons living in Qatar, including Qatari nationals, for allegedly raising funds or making donations to both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State."
116,"With the states continuing as the primary insurance regulators, following Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve exercised holding company oversight over insurers who owned a bank subsidiary or who were designated for enhanced supervision (popularly known as systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs) by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).
In addition to market access, national treatment, and MFN obligations, FTAs include WTO-plus obligations, such as increased transparency by providing interested persons from one party the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations of another party; allowing foreign providers to supply new financial services if domestic companies are permitted to do so; and providing access to public payment and clearing systems.
In further contrast, as mentioned previously, international agreements entered into by federal financial regulators, such as the Basel Capital accords in banking, have no specific congressional notification requirements, but must be implemented through the rulemaking process.
The AIA's senior vice president and general counsel noted that, ""when negotiations began, U.S. insurance and reinsurance groups were facing growing obstacles to their ability to do business in Europe, but this agreement removes those barriers—affirming not only each other's regulatory systems, but also their commitments to non-discriminatory treatment and open, reciprocal, competitive insurance markets.""  State regulators and state lawmakers , respectively represented by the NAIC and National Council of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL), expressed concern with the agreement due to the limited state involvement in the negotiation process and the potential federal preemption of state laws and regulations.
A Council of the EU representative indicated that ""an agreement with the U.S. will greatly facilitate trade in reinsurance and related activities"" and would ""enable us, for instance, to recognize each other's prudential rules and help supervisors exchange information."" The European Union, Solvency II, and Equivalency The covered agreement also aims to assist U.S. insurers concerned with potential regulatory burdens in relation to EU market requirements that went into effect in 2016."
117,"The President must also make a written determination ""that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security."" Requirements Under the Atomic Energy Act Section 123 of the AEA specifies the necessary steps for engaging in nuclear cooperation with another country.
These include guarantees that safeguards on transferred nuclear material and equipment continue in perpetuity; International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) comprehensive safeguards are applied in nonnuclear weapon states; nothing transferred is used for any nuclear explosive device or for any other military purpose; the United States has the right to demand the return of transferred nuclear materials and equipment, as well as any special nuclear material produced through their use, if the cooperating state detonates a nuclear explosive device or terminates or abrogates an IAEA safeguards agreement; there is no retransfer of material or classified data without U.S. consent; physical security on nuclear material is maintained; there is no enrichment or reprocessing by the recipient state of transferred nuclear material or nuclear material produced with materials or facilities transferred pursuant to the agreement without prior approval; storage for transferred plutonium and highly enriched uranium is approved in advance by the United States; and any material or facility produced or constructed through use of special nuclear technology transferred under the cooperation agreement is subject to all of the above requirements.
Section 133 states that, before approving a subsequent arrangement involving certain transfers of special nuclear material, the Secretary of Energy must consult with the Secretary of Defense ""on whether the physical protection of that material during the export or transfer will be adequate to deter theft, sabotage, and other acts of international terrorism which would result in the diversion of that material."" If the Secretary of Defense determines that ""the export or transfer might be subject to a genuine terrorist threat,"" that Secretary is required to provide a written risk assessment of the risk and a ""description of the actions"" that he or she ""considers necessary to upgrade physical protection measures."" Examples of Subsequent Arrangements U.S.-Japan Agreement The first test of the subsequent arrangement provisions came in August 1978, when the Department of Energy informed the House and Senate foreign relations committees of a Japanese request for approval of the transfer of spent fuel assemblies from Japan to the United Kingdom for reprocessing."
118,"The SBA has argued that its support of management and technical assistance training for small businesses has contributed ""to the long-term success of these businesses and their ability to grow and create jobs."" It currently provides financial support to about 14,000 resource partners, including 63 small business development centers (SBDCs) and nearly 900 SBDC local outreach locations, 128 women's business centers (WBCs), and 350 chapters of the mentoring program, SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives).
The House Committee on Small Business has argued that the SBA's various management and technical assistance training programs should be ""folded into the mission of the SBDC program or their responsibilities should be taken over by other agencies"" because they ""overlap each other and duplicate the educational services provided by other agencies."" Congress has also explored ways to improve the SBA's measurement of these programs' effectiveness.
SBDCs were to ""rely on the private sector primarily, and the university community, in partnership with the SBA and its other programs, to fill gaps in making quality management assistance available to the small business owner."" Although most SBDCs continued to be affiliated with universities, the legislation authorized the SBA to provide funding  to any State government or any agency thereof, any regional entity, any State-chartered development, credit or finance corporation, any public or private institution of higher education, including but not limited to any land-grant college or university, any college or school of business, engineering, commerce, or agriculture, community college or junior college, or to any entity formed by two or more of the above entities.
SBDC funding is allocated on a pro rata basis among the states (defined to include the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa) by a statutory formula ""based on the percentage of the population of each State, as compared to the population of the United States."" If, as is currently the case, SBDC funding exceeds $90 million, the minimum funding level is ""the sum of $500,000, plus a percentage of $500,000 equal to the percentage amount by which the amount made available exceeds $90 million."" In 1984, P.L. 98-395 , the Small Business Development Center Improvement Act of 1984, required SBDCs, as a condition of receiving SBA funding, to contribute a matching amount equal to the grant amount, and that the match must be provided by nonfederal sources and be comprised of not less than 50% cash and not more than 50% of indirect costs and in-kind contributions.
Today, the SBA provides grants to SBDCs that are ""hosted by leading universities, colleges, and state economic development agencies"" to deliver management and technical assistance training ""to small businesses and nascent entrepreneurs (pre-venture) in order to promote growth, expansion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement."" These services are delivered, in most instances, on a nonfee, one-on-one confidential counseling basis and are administered by 63 lead service centers, one located in each state (four in Texas and six in California), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa."

120,"For instance, the Firearm Owners' Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA) carved out exceptions to the felony firearm prohibition for certain crimes, repealed certain regulations pertaining to ammunition, expressly prohibited the creation of a national gun registry, added additional categories of persons who are barred from possessing firearms, prohibited the private possession of machineguns manufactured on or after the date of FOPA's enactment, and further expanded the available criminal penalties for violations, among other things.
United States that this forced disclosure of potentially incriminating information violated the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides in part that no person ""shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself[.]"" Haynes prompted Congress to amend the statute to make clear, among other things, that no information from registration records that are required to be submitted or retained by a natural person may be used as evidence against that person in a criminal proceeding for a violation of law occurring prior to or concurrently with the filing of the records, unless the prosecution relates to the furnishing of false information.
Gun Control Act of 1968 Congress passed the GCA in the wake of the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy to ""keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency and to assist law enforcement authorities in the states and their subdivisions in combating the increasing prevalence of crime in the United States."" Among other things, the statute represented ""a Congressional attempt to stem the traffic in dangerous weapons being used in an increasing number of crimes involving personal injury."" As enacted, the GCA expanded the existing licensing scheme for the manufacture, importation, and sale of firearms and augmented a previously enacted prohibition on the possession of firearms by certain categories of persons (including felons and ""mental defective[s]"").
Specifically, a person is prohibited if he or she is a felon (i.e., someone who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year); is a fugitive from justice; is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, any controlled substance; has been adjudicated as a ""mental defective"" or committed to a mental institution; has been admitted to the United States pursuant to a nonimmigrant visa or is an unlawfully present alien; has been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces; has renounced his or her U.S. citizenship; is subject to a court order preventing that person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner (or that partner's child) or engaging in other conduct that would cause the partner to reasonably fear bodily injury to himself or herself or the child; or has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
The prohibition on firearm possession by those who unlawfully use or are addicted to controlled substances also raises the question of what it means to be an ""unlawful user"" or ""addicted."" Regulations define the terms as including those who have ""lost the power of self-control with reference to the use of [a] controlled substance,"" as well as ""current user[s]"" of a controlled substance ""in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician."" The regulations make clear that one need not be using a controlled substance ""at the precise time"" a firearm is sought so long as use has occurred ""recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct."" Prosecutions and court decisions appear to focus on the term unlawful user , which establishes a lower disability threshold than ""addict[]."" Cases interpreting the term ""typically discuss two concepts: contemporaneousness and regularity,"" requiring that there be some ""pattern"" and ""recency"" of controlled-substance use.
Congress has relied on the Commerce Clause as a constitutional basis for GCA provisions restricting the manufacture, import, sale, transfer, and possession of firearms, and the Supreme Court has reviewed a number of these regulations.
Without finding a substantial effect on interstate commerce, the Court further concluded that the law exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause because ""[t]he Act neither regulate[d] a commercial activity nor contain[ed] a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce."" Congress subsequently amended the provision to provide expressly that, for the possession of a firearm in a school zone to be a federal crime, the government must show that the firearm ""moved in or ..."
121,"The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) notes that the Southwest border ""remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States."" Mexican TCOs control the flow of heroin across the border, the majority of which ""is through [privately owned vehicles] entering the United States at legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods."" Mexican criminal networks have not always featured so prominently (or broadly) in the U.S. heroin market.
Administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the program aims to reduce drug production and trafficking through four means: promoting coordination and information sharing between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement; bolstering intelligence sharing between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement; providing reliable intelligence to law enforcement agencies such that they may be better equipped to design effective enforcement operations and strategies; and promoting coordinated law enforcement strategies that rely upon available resources to reduce illegal drug supplies not only in a given area, but throughout the country.
In 2015, ONDCP launched the Heroin Response Strategy (HRS), ""a multi-HIDTA, cross-disciplinary approach that develops partnerships among public safety and public health agencies at the Federal, state and local levels to reduce drug overdose fatalities and disrupt trafficking in illicit opioids."" Within the HRS, a Public Health and Public Safety Network coordinates teams of drug intelligence officers and public health analysts in each state."
122,"8(a) Program eligibility is generally limited to small businesses which are ""unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who are of good character and citizens of and residing in the United States"" and demonstrate ""potential for success."" However, small businesses owned by Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) are also eligible to participate in the 8(a) Program under somewhat different terms.
The Small Business Act also indicates ""that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy."" To help achieve these goals, the 8(a) Program's stated statutory purposes are to  (A) promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals so that such concerns can compete on an equal basis in the American economy; (B) promote the competitive viability of such concerns in the marketplace by providing such available contract, financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary; and (C) clarify and expand the program for the procurement by the United States of articles, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon laid foundations for the present 8(a) Program in the hope of providing such ""encouragement."" Johnson created the President's Test Cities Program (PTCP), which involved a small-scale use of the SBA's authority under Section 8(a) to award contracts to firms willing to locate in urban areas and hire unemployed individuals, largely African Americans, or sponsor minority-owned businesses by providing capital or management assistance.
General Requirements Program Eligibility As mentioned previously, 8(a) Program eligibility is limited to ""small business[es] which [are] unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who are of good character and citizens of and residing in the United States, and which demonstrates potential for success."" Each of these terms is defined by the Small Business Act; SBA regulations; and judicial and administrative decisions.
Sole-source awards of contracts valued at $4 million ($7 million or more for manufacturing contracts) may be made only when (1) there is not a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible 8(a) firms will submit offers at a fair market price or (2) the SBA accepts the requirement on behalf of an 8(a) firm owned by an Indian tribe, an ANC or, in the case of Department of Defense contracts, an NHO.
Other Requirements Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes are governed by the same regulations as other 8(a) firms in which certain of the ""other requirements"" are involved, including (1) inability to protest an 8(a) firm's eligibility for an award; (2) maximum of nine years in the program (for individual firms); and (3) limits on subcontracting."

127,"Successive U.S. Administrations have viewed U.S. leadership of NATO as a cornerstone of U.S. national security strategy, bringing benefits ranging from peace and stability in Europe to the political and military support of 28 allies, including many of the world's most advanced militaries.
Historical Context: NATO's Evolution4 Broadly speaking, NATO has evolved through four phases since its inception in 1949:  t he Cold War era between 1949 and 1991; t he post-Cold War transformation of the 1990s , marked by the start of NATO enlargement to former Warsaw Pact countries and debates over ""out-of-area"" military operations prompted by wars in the Western Balkans; t he post-September 11, 2001 , focus on crisis management and stabilizing Afghanistan; and s ince 2014, a renewed focus on deterring Russia and heightened concern about threats emanating from the Middle East and North Africa.
The United States led a renewed push for the allies to increase defense spending and develop military capabilities to better respond to the new security environment, including ""out-of-area"" stabilization and counter-insurgency operations.
Since the end of the Cold War, NATO allies and partner countries have contributed to a range of NATO-led military operations across the globe, including in the Western Balkans, Afghanistan, the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe."
128,"The combined total of $45.9 billion would have been about $3.2 billion below the President's FY2019 request, with the largest differences in the funding for the General Services Administration (GSA) and in language relating to government-wide transfers that was requested by the President but not included in the legislation (Section 737)."

132,"Introduction The 116 th Congress, in both its legislative and oversight capacities, faces numerous trade policy issues related to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations and the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
After numerous rounds of negotiations, on August 31, 2018, after the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary U.S.-Mexico agreement, President Trump notified Congress of his intention to ""enter into a trade agreement with Mexico – and with Canada if it is willing."" On September 30, 2018, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer announced that the three countries had reached an agreement on a USMCA trade deal that would revise, modernize, and replace NAFTA upon ratification.
Canada, in its negotiating objectives, pledged to make NAFTA more ""progressive"" by strengthening labor and environmental provisions, adding a new chapter on indigenous rights, reforming the investor-state dispute settlement process, and protecting Canada's supply-management system for dairy and poultry, among other objectives.
Mexico's set of negotiating objectives prioritized free trade of goods and services, and included provisions to update NAFTA, such as working toward ""inclusive and responsible"" trade by incorporating cooperation mechanisms in areas related to labor standards, anticorruption, and the environment, as well as strengthening energy security by enhancing NAFTA's chapter on energy.
U.S. objectives appeared to seek to ""rebalance the benefits"" of the agreement, echoing President Trump's statements that NAFTA has been a ""disaster"" and the ""worst agreement ever negotiated."" Some U.S. negotiating positions could be seen to have the explicit or implicit goal of promoting U.S. economic sovereignty and/or rolling back previous liberalization commitments in specific areas, such as reviewing and potentially sunsetting the agreement every five years, questioning the validity of binational dispute settlement, enhancing government procurement restrictions, and increasing U.S. and North American content in the auto rules of origin.
Many economists and business representatives generally look to maintain and strengthen the trade and investment relationship with Canada and Mexico under NAFTA or the proposed USMCA, and to further improve overall relations and economic integration within the region.
At the time that NAFTA was implemented, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) was already in effect and U.S. tariffs on most Mexican goods were low, while Mexico had the highest level of trade barriers among the three countries.
Core provisions promote transparency in the tendering process through online tender information and descriptions; provide online application and documentation processes without cost to the applicant; provide for publication of post-award explanations of procurement decisions; exclude government procurement from the financial services chapter; exclude textile and apparel procured by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the ""Kissell Amendment;"" allow Mexico to set aside annual procurement contracts of $2.328 billion, annually adjusted for inflation, to Mexican suppliers; allow for coverage of build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts (As Mexico has taken an exception to this provision, the United States will extend this coverage to Mexico when Mexico reciprocates.) The exclusion of Canada is a break from previous government procurement chapters in U.S. FTAs. As noted above, procurement opportunities in each country for U.S. and Canadian firms will continue to be covered by the GPA, which was revised and updated in 2014.
Key provisions of the services chapter in NAFTA and the proposed USMCA include the following:  nondiscriminatory treatment of services from partner-country providers in like circumstances, including national treatment and MFN treatment; no limitations on the number of service suppliers, the total value or volume of services provided, the number of persons employed, or the types of legal entities or joint ventures that a foreign service supplier may employ; prohibition on locality requirements that a service provider maintain a commercial presence in the country of the buyer; support of mutual recognition of professional qualifications for certification of service providers; transparency in the development and application of government regulations; and allowance for payments and transfers of capital flows ""freely and without delay"" that relate to the provision of services, with permissible restrictions in some cases for bankruptcy and criminal offences.
Other new USMCA financial services provisions would exclude government procurement from financial services disciplines; modify investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) through a bilateral annex on Mexico-United States Investment Disputes in Financial Services; allow a financial institution from one party with a presence in a second party to have access to the latter's payment and clearance system; and protect source code and algorithms and a prohibition on forced technology transfer in the digital trade section.
Key provisions of the proposed USMCA digital trade chapter ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of digital products; prohibit cross-border data flows restrictions and data localization requirements; prohibit requirements for source code or algorithm disclosure or transfer as a condition for market access, with exceptions; prohibit customs duties or other charges for electronically transmitted products; require parties to have online consumer protection and anti-spam laws, and a legal framework on privacy; promote cooperation on cybersecurity, and risk-based strategies and consensus-based standards over prescriptive regulation in combating cybersecurity risks and events; prohibit imposition of liability for harms against Internet services providers or users related to information stored, processed, transmitted, distributed, or made available by the service, with the exclusion of ISP liability for intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement; and promote publication of open government data in machine readable format for public usage.
The proposed USMCA protects GIs for food products that Canada and Mexico have already accepted as a consequence of trade agreements with the European Union; provides transparency and notification requirements, and objection procedures, for new GIs; and sets forth guidelines to determine whether a term is customary in the common language.
Key issues Congress may examine include modernized provisions of the agreement, the role of the Congress and the President in the NAFTA renegotiation and approval process, whether the agreement meets TPA objectives, the possible economic impact, especially in the auto industry, and how the agreement may impact U.S. relations with Canada and Mexico, two of the United States' largest trading partners.
The full effects of the proposed USMCA on North American trade relations are not be expected to be significant because nearly all U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico that meets rules of origin requirements is now conducted duty and barrier free under NAFTA."
133,"According to an informal agreement among their member countries, the U.S. nominee is chosen as the World Bank president and a European candidate (typically French or German) is appointed as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
As the largest contributor, the United States holds a single seat on the 25-member Board of Executive Directors and carries 16.32% of the total votes in Bank decisionmaking, which provides veto power on decisions requiring an 85% majority vote."
134,"Introduction Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States ""by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate."" The method by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, referred to broadly as the confirmation process, serves several purposes.
In addition, at the start of each Congress, the Senate adopts a standing order, by unanimous consent, that allows the Senate to receive nominations from the President and for them to be referred to committees even on days when the Senate does not meet in executive session.
Cloture may be moved only on a question that is pending before the Senate; therefore, absent unanimous consent, the Senate must be in executive session and considering the nomination when the motion is filed.
Instead, Senators typically debated the nomination for some time post-cloture, but also usually entered into unanimous consent agreements that affected when the vote would occur."
135,"DOI defines its mission as to protect and manage the nation's natural resources and cultural heritage for the benefit of the American people; to provide scientific and scholarly information about those resources and natural hazards; and to exercise the country's trust responsibilities and special commitments to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and island territories under U.S. administration.
Initially conceived as a ""home department"" in 1849 to oversee a broad array of internal affairs, DOI has evolved to become the nation's principal land management agency, charged with administering the use of more than 480 million acres of public lands, 700 million acres of subsurface minerals, and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf (OCS).
DOI Today: Leadership, Structure, and Functions Overview DOI is a Cabinet-level department that employs approximately 65,000 full-time employees across nine technical bureaus and various administrative and programmatic offices.
Similar to other DOI agencies, the BIA has a three-tiered organizational structure, with leadership and senior executives operating from headquarters in Washington, DC, and 12 regional offices that oversee 53 field offices (referred to as agencies by the BIA); these agencies deliver program services directly to tribal communities."
136,"Should such a post be established, potential candidates include the deputy prime minister for cabinet affairs, Fahd bin Mahmud Al Said (who Omanis already widely refer to as ""Prime Minister""); the secretary general of the Foreign Ministry, Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi; Salim bin Nasir al-Ismaily, a businessman and economic adviser to the Sultan who reportedly brokered 2013 U.S.-Iran meetings; and Royal Office head General Sultan bin Mohammad al-Naamani.
Representative Institutions, Election History, and Unrest Many Omanis, U.S. officials, and international observers credit Sultan Qaboos for establishing consultative institutions and electoral processes before there was evident public pressure to do so.
By mid-2012, the government had calmed the unrest through a combination of reforms and punishments, including expanding the powers of the Oman Council; appointing several members of the Consultative Council as ministers; giving the office of the public prosecutor autonomy and consumers additional protections; naming an additional woman minister; ordering that additional public sector jobs be created; increasing the minimum wage; making grants to unemployed job seekers; and arresting journalists, bloggers, and other activists for ""defaming the Sultan,"" ""illegal gathering,"" or violating the country's cyber laws.
In July 2017, during a visit by Oman's de-facto Foreign Minister Yusuf Alawi to Tehran, Iran and Oman announced plans to strengthen their ties—a statement interpreted as an Omani signal of disagreement with the Saudi-led move to isolate Qatar.

As the only GCC state that has not joined the Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting to restore the Hadi government and with its ties to Iran, Oman has become a mediator of the Yemen conflict.
Days after the signing, the United States used Oman's Masirah Island air base to launch the failed attempt to rescue the U.S. Embassy hostages in Iran, although Omani officials assert that they were not informed of that operation in advance.

137,"Introduction The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program provides long-term, low-interest loans and other types of credit assistance for the construction of surface transportation projects.
These limits include the number of projects that can take advantage of credit assistance, the difficulties of developing revenue mechanisms to service loans, the typical need for grant funding to make up a portion of the capital, and the difficulties of attracting private investment to risky projects, particularly those for which demand is uncertain or hard to predict.
Despite the higher limit established in law, DOT has generally limited loans and loan guarantees to no more than 33% of project costs, so as ""to ensure that the DOT shares the credit risk with other participants."" Projects eligible for TIFIA assistance include highways and bridges, public transportation, transit-oriented development, intercity passenger bus and rail, intermodal connectors, intermodal freight facilities, and the capitalization of a rural projects fund."

In September 2018, Prime Minister Hun Sen, in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, stated, ""We are heartedly regretful to highlight the fact that human rights nowadays have become 'a mission to impose civilization' for some powerful nations or, perhaps, as their operating standards as the pretext for interference under the name of political right protection."" U.S.-Cambodia Cooperation U.S.-Cambodian relations expanded after 2007, when political and human rights conditions in the Kingdom improved and the U.S. government lifted some restrictions on U.S. assistance."
140,"Section 103H(g) permitted lawful disclosures to the IGIC, but lacked the specificity of later whistleblower protection legislation and directives:  (3) The Inspector General [of the Intelligence Community] is authorized to receive and investigate, pursuant to subsection (h), complaints or information from any person concerning the existence of an activity within the authorities and responsibilities of the Director of National Intelligence constituting a violation of laws, rules, or regulations, or mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety."
141,"the individual who considers himself injured[] has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy."" Naturally, Congress and its Members have an interest in litigating in federal court, for example, to vindicate their institutional priorities, to argue that the Executive is violating their legislative prerogatives, or to advance their legislative policy interests.
Americans United for Separation of Church and State , the Supreme Court held that a public interest organization lacked standing to challenge the transfer of federal land to a religiously affiliated school, as the only injuries identified by the plaintiffs were the ""psychological consequence[s] presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees."" A claim based only on this sort of psychological discomfort will generally not support an injury-in-fact.
He argued that so-called ""intra-parliamentary disputes"" should be left to parliaments, and that the injuries suffered here ""pertain[ed] to legislators not as individuals but as political representatives executing the legislative process."" If these interests were recognized, Frankfurter feared that the courts would end up ""sit[ting] in judgment on the manifold disputes engendered by procedures for voting in legislative assemblies."" Despite these arguments, Justice Frankfurter's view did not control, and Coleman is recognized as the first case in which the Supreme Court acknowledged that legislators' interest in their votes may constitute an injury that could be vindicated in federal court.
The Members argued that their injury was more severe than the injury at stake in Raines because the President's action had ""denied Members of Congress any opportunity to vote for or against the AHRI."" The D.C. Circuit disagreed, concluding instead that the injury asserted by the plaintiffs in Chenoweth was fundamentally the same as that asserted in Raines —that their injury was an ""alter[ation] [in] the constitutional balance of powers between the Legislative and Executive Branches."" Further, the court observed that here, as in Raines , it was ""uncontested that the Congress could terminate the AHRI were a sufficient number in each House so inclined,"" meaning that, as in Raines , Congress had a legislative remedy.
The court concluded that the availability of these alternate remedies, combined with the fact that Congress as a whole had not authorized these individual Members to represent its interests in federal litigation, demonstrated that the plaintiffs could not assert the institutional injury alleged.
The court therefore ultimately concluded ""that the Committee ha[d] standing to enforce its duly issued subpoena through a civil suit."" According to the court, the fact that the committee had ""been expressly authorized by House Resolution to proceed on behalf of the House of Representatives as an institution "" distinguished Miers from cases like Raines in which individual legislators had invalidly attempted to assert injuries to their respective institutions as a whole rather than to themselves personally.
The Supreme Court has periodically considered how the adversity and standing doctrines apply in the congressional intervention context and has ultimately concluded that cases in which the executive branch declines to defend a federal statute and Congress steps in to defend the law may potentially be justiciable."
142,"The Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2019, as part of an overall budget that the Office of Management and Budget estimated to be $74.88 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not annually appropriated or does not score against discretionary budget limits).
The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the BCA, and in the budget request for the Department of Defense, $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding (OCO), to be transferred to the Coast Guard.
Division A, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.69 billion (3.5%) more than had been provided for FY2018, and $2.04 billion more than had been requested by the Administration in February 2018.
Following the methodology used by the appropriations committees, totals of ""appropriations"" do not include resources provided by transfer or under adjustments to discretionary spending limits (i.e., for emergency requirements, overseas contingency operations for the Coast Guard or the cost of major disasters under the Stafford Act for the Federal Emergency Management Agency)."
143,"Any proposed on-the-ground activities or projects must be consistent with those plans and must be planned, evaluated, and implemented using BLM's procedures for ensuring compliance with the laws that apply broadly to any federal agency action (e.g., NEPA, ESA, NHPA).
For example, within the framework of determining the resources affected and level of effects of a given proposal, the agency's NEPA process would identify project impacts that may trigger additional environmental review and consultation requirements under ESA and NHPA, among other laws.
Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) HFRA, among other purposes, was intended to expedite the planning and review process for hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands.
Sage Grouse/Mule Deer CE Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, for NFS lands, and the Secretary of the Interior, for BLM lands, to establish a CE for specified projects to protect, restore, or improve greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat within one year of enactment.
This included reauthorizing the use of procedures intended to expedite the priority projects in NFS areas designated as I&D areas and expanding the definition of an authorized fuel reduction project, as discussed previously in the "" Planning and Project Implementation Requirements "" section.
Section 103 of the FY2018 omnibus requires the applicable Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to ""promptly"" submit a request to Congress for supplemental appropriations if the amount provided for wildfire suppression operations for a fiscal year is estimated to be exhausted within 30 days.
Specifically, Section 210 directs FS to consult with federal and state partners, and relevant colleges and universities to develop, within two years, web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for use at the community level to inform risk management decisions for at-risk communities adjacent to NFS lands or affected by wildland fire.
Forest Service Communication Uses Fee Schedules and Processes Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process to issue special use authorizations for communications uses on NFS lands within one year of enactment, defined relevant terms, and identified specific requirements for the process.
The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution ROWs and identified specific requirements for those processes."
144,"The FY2019 appropriations act included a decrease from FY2018 levels for discretionary conservation programs and redirected funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center (see Table 1 and Figure 1 ).
The enacted level is more than the Administration's request and directs a transfer of funds from other accounts into the Business Center, including mandatory conservation programs and farm loan accounts."
145,"As a consequence, even with the additional scope provided by the language of the separate order, it would likely not be in order to include broad legislative provisions in, or amendments to, a specific appropriation bill that would apply to the salary or number of federal employees funded through appropriations in other measures."
146,"The Dodd-Frank Act automatically subjected all bank holding companies and foreign banks with more than $50 billion in assets to enhanced prudential regulation (EPR).
In addition, Basel III (a nonbinding international agreement that U.S. banking regulators implemented through rulemaking after the financial crisis) included several capital requirements that only apply to large banks.
Banks that have been designated as Global-Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) by the Financial Stability Board (an international, intergovernmental forum) or have more than $250 billion in assets automatically remain subject to all EPR requirements, as modified.
Although THCs are also regulated by the Fed, the EPR statute does not mention THCs. To date, enhanced prudential regulatory requirements have not been applied to large thrift (savings and loan) holding companies, with the exception of company-run stress tests.
U.S. Institutions Subject to EPR Under P.L. 115-174 The proposed rule that would implement P.L. 115-174 's changes to the $50 billion asset threshold creates four categories of banks based on their asset size and systemic importance, with increasingly stringent EPR requirements applied to each category as these characteristics increase.
In addition, over 80 foreign banks (including those in Table 2 ) would be required to submit resolution plans (or living wills) under a proposed rule, because they had more than $250 billion in worldwide assets and operate in the United States, regardless of the extent of their U.S. assets.
The banking regulators also issued a final rule implementing a Basel III countercyclical capital buffer applied to banks with more than $250 billion in assets or more $10 billion in foreign exposure."

1857 , the Senate companion bill, would have increased the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $5 million to $6 million, increased the program's repayment terms from not more than 6 years to not more than 10 years for loans greater than $10,000, and required the SBA Administrator to establish a rule enabling intermediaries to apply for a waiver of the requirement that no more than 25% of Microloan technical assistance grant funds may be used to provide information and technical assistance to prospective borrowers.
S. 2850 , the Microloan Program Modernization Act of 2016, would have increased the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $5 million to $6 million and, among other provisions, eliminated the requirements that intermediaries spend no more than 25% of Microloan technical assistance grant funds on technical assistance to prospective borrowers and no more than 25% of those funds on third party contracts for technical assistance.

148,"The OASDI Trust Funds' Board of Trustees (the trustees) manages the trust funds according to requirements set forth in the Social Security Act. Under current law, the trust funds' assets may be invested only in U.S. government securities issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.
If this equity premium persists, it would be possible to maintain Social Security benefits for all income groups of workers, greatly improving the money's worth for younger workers without incurring the risks that could accompany individual investment.… As a matter of financial theory, the diversification achieved by investing in both stocks and government bonds should also reduce portfolio risk for the OASDI Trust Fund.
Some critics of this approach are concerned that by investing in private companies and gaining some control over their activities, the federal government would be intervening in the market, resulting in what some have described as ""socialism by the backdoor method."" The advisory council reasoned as follows:  Another practical disadvantage would be the need for a far-reaching and deep-searching investment policy that would permit the trust funds to obtain an adequate rate of interest with reasonable security of principal.
Table 1 shows that under current law, the long-range actuarial balance is -2.84% of taxable payroll, indicating that under intermediate assumptions provided in T he 2018 Annual Report , an approximately 2.84-percentage-point increase in payroll tax rate (from current the 12.40% to 15.24%) or a comparable reduction in benefits would be needed to maintain program solvency throughout the projection period and result in a trust funds ratio of 100% at the end of the projection period."
149,"The issue of regulation of and access to broadband networks is currently being addressed in three venues at the FCC, where the commissioners on December 14, 2017, adopted (3-2) an Order that went into effect on June 11, 2018, that revokes the 2015 regulatory framework in favor of one that reverses the 2015 classification of broadband internet access services as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act, provides for a less regulatory approach, and shifts much of the oversight from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ); in the courts, where consolidated petitions for review of the 2017 Order are under consideration in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit; and a suit filed in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of California by the DOJ and various trade groups, challenging the legality of a California internet regulation law, is pending; in the 116 th Congress, where debate over what the appropriate regulatory framework should be for broadband access continues.
Additional provisions in the order included those which provided for ongoing monitoring of the mobile broadband sector and created an Open Internet Advisory Committee to track and evaluate the effects of the rules and provide recommendations to the FCC regarding open internet policies and practices; while not banning paid prioritization, stated that it was unlikely to satisfy the ""no unreasonable discrimination"" rule; raised concerns about specialized services and while not ""adopting policies specific to such services at this time,"" would closely monitor such services; called for review, and possible adjustment, of all rules in the order no later than two years from their effective date; and detailed a formal and informal complaint process.
The Federal Communications Commission Response In response to the court remand, then FCC Chairman Wheeler issued, on February 19, 2014, a statement outlining the steps proposed ""to ensure that the Internet remains a platform for innovation, economic growth, and free expression."" Chairman Wheeler proposed that the FCC establish new rules under its Section 706 authority that enforce and enhance the transparency rule that was upheld by the court; fulfill the ""no blocking"" goal; fulfill the goals of the nondiscrimination rule; leave open as an option the possible reclassification of internet access service as telecommunications service subject to Title II authority; forgo judicial review of the appeals court decision; solicit public comment; hold internet service providers to their commitment to honor the safeguards articulated in the 2010 Open Internet Order; and seek opportunities to enhance competition in the internet access market.
The order includes among its provisions the following: reclassifies ""broadband Internet access service"" (that is the retail broadband service Americans buy from cable, phone, and wireless providers) as a telecommunications service under Title II; bans blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization; creates a general conduct standard that internet service providers cannot harm consumers or edge providers (e.g., Google, Netflix) and gives the FCC the authority to address questionable practices on a case-by-case basis (reasonable network management will not be considered a violation of this rule); enhances existing transparency rules for both end users and edge providers (a temporary exemption from the transparency enhancements is given for small fixed and mobile providers) and creates a ""safe harbor"" process for the format and nature of the required disclosure for consumers; permits an internet service provider to engage in ""reasonable network management"" (other than paid prioritization) and will take into account the specific network management needs of mobile networks and other technologies such as unlicensed Wi-Fi networks; does not apply the open internet rules to ""non-BIAS data services,"" (aka, specialized services) a category of services defined by the FCC as those that ""do not provide access to the Internet generally"" (e.g., heart monitors or energy consumption sensors); does not apply the open internet rules to interconnection but does gives the FCC authority to hear complaints and take enforcement action, if necessary, on a case-by-case basis, under Sections 201 and 202, regarding interconnection activities of internet service providers if deemed unjust and unreasonable; applies major provisions of Title II such as no unjust and unreasonable practices or discrimination, consumer privacy, disability access, consumer complaint and enforcement processes, and fair access to poles and conduits; and forbears, without any further proceedings, from various Title II provisions (e.g., cost accounting rules, tariffs, and last-mile unbundling) resulting in forbearance from 30 statutory provisions and over 700 codified rules.
More specifically, the NPR proposed to reinstate the information service classification of broadband internet access service (both fixed and mobile), thereby removing the service from the Title II, common carrier classification imposed by the 2015 Open Internet Order and placing it under Title I; reinstate that mobile broadband internet access service is not a commercial mobile service; eliminate the general conduct standard; seek comment on the need to ""keep, modify, or eliminate"" the ""bright line"" (no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization) and transparency rules; return authority to the Federal Trade Commission to oversee and enforce the privacy practices of internet service providers; reevaluate the FCC's enforcement regime with respect to the necessity for ex ante regulatory intervention; and conduct a cost-benefit analysis as part of the proceeding.
H.R. 1096 , introduced on February 7, 2019, by Representative Rodgers, amends Title I of the Communications Act to require rules applicable to BIAS providers that establish transparency requirements; prohibit blocking and degrading (throttling) lawful traffic, subject to reasonable network management; prohibit paid prioritization; and contain a savings clause relating to emergency communications, law enforcement, public safety or national security, copyright infringement or other unlawful activity.
More specifically, provisions contained in both measures included those which prohibited broadband internet access service (BIAS) providers from blocking lawful content or degrading (throttling) lawful internet traffic, subject to reasonable network management; granted FCC enforcement authority and required the FCC to establish formal complaint procedures to address alleged violations; preserved the ability of BIAS providers to offer, with a prohibition on certain practices, specialized services; established BIAS as an information service; and preempted state and local authority over ""internet openness obligations"" for the provision of BIAS with exceptions for emergency communications or law enforcement, public safety, or national security obligations."
150,"The windfall elimination provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula designed to remove the unintended advantage, or ""windfall,"" of the regular benefit formula for certain retired or disabled workers who spent less than full careers in covered employment and who are also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs not covered by Social Security."
151,"Trade promotion authority (TPA), sometimes called ""fast track,"" refers to the process Congress has made available to the President for limited periods to enable legislation to approve and implement certain international trade agreements to be considered under expedited legislative procedures.
Certain trade agreements negotiated by the President, such as agreements that reduce barriers to trade in ways that require changes in U.S. law, must be approved and implemented by Congress through legislation.
Because an implementing bill faced potential amendment by Members of Congress that could alter a long-negotiated agreement, Congress adopted fast track authority in the Trade Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-618 ) to ensure that the implementing bill could receive floor consideration and to provide a procedure under which it could not be amended.
No. If the United States enters into (signs) a trade agreement within a period for which TPA is provided, the President may submit the implementing bill to Congress a day on which both the House and the Senate are in session, regardless of whether TPA expired before that date.
The principal trade negotiating objective concerning trade remedies in TPA-2015 and previous TPA legislation has been to ""preserve the ability of the United States to rigorously enforce its trade laws"" and to avoid concluding ""agreements that weaken the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade."" Trade remedies have usually been addressed in the context of multilateral WTO negotiations, though some FTAs have included commitments related to trade remedies.
TPA-2015 also maintains past notification provisions that require the President to notify Congress about any proposals advanced in a negotiation that involve potential changes to U.S. trade remedy laws 180 days before signing (entering into) a trade agreement.
To support this statement, the President submits an explanation of how the implementing bill and administrative action will ""change or affect U.S. law."" The President is also to submit with the draft implementing bill a statement explaining how the agreement makes progress in achieving the ""purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives"" of the TPA, whether it changes an agreement previously negotiated, and how it ""serves the interests of United States commerce,"" as well as how the implementing bill meets the requirement that its provisions altering existing law are ""strictly necessary or appropriate."" Must Congress consider covered trade agreements under the expedited legislative procedures?
TPA-2015 retains a procedural mechanism from the 2002 authority, under which either house can adopt a simple resolution (H.Res. or S.Res.) finding that changes to U.S. trade remedy laws provided for in a trade agreement implementing bill submitted by the President are inconsistent with statutory negotiating objectives on that subject."
152,"First, the Court declared that possessing weapons for self-defense is ""central to the Second Amendment right,"" yet the District's handgun ban prohibits ""an entire class of 'arms' that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose."" Moreover, the handgun prohibition extended into the home, where, the Court added, ""the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute."" Additionally, the requirement that firearms in the home be kept inoperable is unconstitutional because, the Court concluded, that requirement ""makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense."" Thus, the Court ruled, the District's handgun ban could not survive under any level of scrutiny that a court typically would apply to a constitutional challenge of an enumerated right.
warrant[s] characterizing it as 'fundamental' insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes."" Additionally, he asserted that the Constitution provides no authority for ""transferring ultimate regulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from democratically elected legislators to courts or from the States to the Federal Government."" Justice Stevens authored another dissenting opinion, arguing that the question before the Court was not whether the Second Amendment, as a whole, applies to the states, but rather whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the liberty interest asserted—""the right to possess a functional, personal firearm, including a handgun, within the home""—be enforceable against the states.
It is also worth noting that, although the D.C. Circuit has applied the two-step approach when evaluating firearm legislation, the newest member of the Supreme Court bench—Justice Kavanaugh—advocated for a different approach while serving as a judge on the D.C. Circuit, arguing that: ""In my view,"" he stated, "" Heller and McDonald leave little doubt that courts are to assess gun bans and regulations based on text, history, and tradition, not by a balancing test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny.""  Step One: Scope of Second Amendment Protection The first question in the two-part framework asks whether the challenged law targets conduct within the scope of the Second Amendment's protections.
At step two, the court applied intermediate scrutiny, concluding that the age-based restriction does not burden the Second Amendment's core protections of law-abiding, responsible citizens, because ""Congress found that persons under 21 tend to be relatively irresponsible and can be prone to violent crime, especially when they have easy access to handguns."" Nor does the restriction prevent 18- to 21-year-olds from possessing handguns for self-defense in the home because, the court added, these persons may lawfully acquire handguns from responsible parents or guardians.
White reasoned that § 922(g)(9) was passed, in part, because Congress had recognized that domestic violence with firearms had not been remedied by ""longstanding felon-in-possession laws,"" and thus the court ""s[aw] no reason to exclude § 922(g)(9) from the list of longstanding prohibitions on which Heller does not cast doubt."" Additionally, the Seventh Circuit sitting en banc and using its unique approach upheld § 922(g)(9) as constitutional after concluding that the government made a ""strong showing"" that § 922(g)(9) is substantially related to an important governmental objective.
Intermediate scrutiny was appropriate because, the court reasoned, a person subject to a domestic violence restraining order is not entitled to the benefit of the ""core right identified in Heller —the right of a law-abiding, responsible citizen to possess and carry a weapon for self-defense."" In applying intermediate scrutiny the Fourth Circuit concluded that the government established a reasonable fit between § 922(g)(8) and the government's substantial interest in reducing domestic gun violence.
to leave the premises and use [a firearm] against those that sought the protections of the protective order."" The court did not find it relevant that the defendant did not actually leave the shooting range with the handgun and incite violence, because the intermediate scrutiny standard of review applicable to the challenged restriction, in the court's view, ""has never been held to require a perfect end-means fit."" Accordingly, the court concluded that ""[i]t is sufficient that § 922(g)(8) rests on an established link between domestic abuse, recidivism, and gun violence and applies to persons already individually adjudged in prior protective order to pose a future threat of abuse."" Unlawful Drug Users and Addicts 18 U.S.C.
Huitron-Guizar assumed that unlawfully present aliens, like the defendant—who also had been in the United States for decades and was brought to the country as a young child—could assert a Second Amendment right, noting that ""we hesitate to infer from Heller a rule that the right to bear arms is categorically inapplicable to non-citizens."" Applying intermediate scrutiny to § 922(g)(5), the court concluded that the law is constitutional, deferring to Congress's ""constitutional power to distinguish between citizens and non-citizens, or between lawful and unlawful aliens, and to ensure safety and order."" Ultimately, the court found a substantial fit between the government's interests in crime control and public safety, and its desire to keep firearms out of the hands of those it deems as ""irresponsible or dangerous.""  What Categories of Firearms May Be Subject to Government Regulation?"
153,"Introduction Social Security is a self-financing program that provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers.
For illustration purposes, the trustees point out that the following cha nges would be needed for the trust funds to remain solvent throughout the 75-year projection period: (1) an immediate 2.70-percentage-point increase in the payroll tax rate (from 12.40% to 15.10%); or (2) an immediate 17% reduction in benefits for all current and future beneficiaries; or (3) some combination of these approaches.
Rather, the program relies on revenues collected for Social Security purposes in previous years that were used by the federal government at the time for other (non-Social Security) spending needs and interest income earned on trust fund investments."

155,"The federal budget is constructed in a manner that provides for lower net deficits in more robust economic conditions, attributable to higher revenues (from taxes on increased output) and, to a smaller degree, lower spending levels (from reduced demand for programs like unemployment insurance).
From FY1969 to FY2018, annual nominal budget deficits and surpluses of the federal government summed to $13.745 trillion; over the same period, total debt held by the public increased by $15.473 trillion.
(3) ΔY= f(ΔL, ΔK, ΔA) Assuming that the stock of labor is insensitive to fiscal policy choices, the effect of federal debt on economic growth depends on how the additional government activity affects the capital stock and productivity of labor and capital relative to what would have happened had amounts borrowed been invested privately or increased net exports."
156,"The report closes with considerations for Congress in conducting its oversight role over U.S. funded anti-corruption efforts in the region and pursuing the policy objective of broadening the rule of law and encouraging good government.
The number of grand-scale scandals exposed in recent years in the region, such as payoff schemes involving high court justices and top-level officials, has led some voters to conclude that all parties and politicians are corrupt, resulting in presidents and vice presidents being pushed from office and traditional political parties being viewed as corrupt and illegitimate.
Early Anti-corruption Approaches  U.S. foreign assistance programs to bolster rule of law, encourage good governance, and eliminate bribery, extortion, and graft have been common in Latin America for about three decades.
Anti-corruption programming sponsored by the United States and major international financial institutions grew out of ferment in the 1970s, when the long-time practice of businesses and foreign corporations paying bribes to gain contracts in developing countries was exposed (see textbox on Select International Efforts to Combat Corruption).
In 1997, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with strong support from the United States, adopted the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
For several years, U.S. foreign assistance has been provided to fight corruption and enhance the rule of law in Latin America (including judicial training), to improve law-enforcement techniques to conduct investigations, make arrests and properly handle evidence, and enhance oversight of civil society for better accountability.
In Mexico, the United States has supported rule of law reforms to increase judicial independence, reduce impunity, and protect journalists in the context of a strong central government.
U.S. efforts have included programs aimed at supporting the country's transition to an accusatorial justice system, establishing a National Anti-corruption System (NAS), bolstering transparency and oversight of government programs, and supporting investigative journalism.
National Anticorruption System and Related Efforts to Improve Transparency  In 2015, the Mexican congress approved and President Peña Nieto signed constitutional reforms creating a system to prevent and punish corruption following intense and sustained lobbying by civil society and the private sector.
USAID has provided support to Mexican government (federal and state) anti-corruption and public administration entities, as well as efforts organized by private sector and civil society groups.
In its annual report on drug policy, the U.S. State Department highlighted these accomplishments and concerns in March 2019:  Guatemala's Attorney General and the UN-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) have investigated hundreds of government officials suspected of corruption.
In Mexico, the United States has worked for years to strengthen the Mexican justice system and help to reform it, and also to support an integrated anti-corruption system, although both new systems have only partially been put into practice."
157,"Temporary Protected Status (TPS), codified by INA Section 244, provides temporary relief from removal and work authorization to foreign nationals in the United States from countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances that prevent their safe return.
In December 1997, President Bill Clinton instructed the Attorney General to grant DED to Haitian nationals in the United States for one year, providing time for the Administration to work with Congress on long-term legislative relief for Haitians.
At the time, then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano stated: ""Providing a temporary refuge for Haitian nationals who are currently in the United States and whose personal safety would be endangered by returning to Haiti is part of this Administration's continuing efforts to support Haiti's recovery."" On July 13, 2010, DHS announced an extension of the TPS registration period for Haitian nationals, citing difficulties nationals were experiencing in obtaining documents to establish identity and nationality, and in gathering funds required to apply for TPS."
158,"In devising a 30-year shipbuilding plan to move the Navy toward its ship force-structure goal, key assumptions and planning factors include but are not limited to ship construction times and service lives, estimated ship procurement costs, projected shipbuilding funding levels, and industrial-base considerations.
Potential for Cost Growth on Navy Ships If one or more Navy ship designs turn out to be more expensive to build than the Navy estimates, then the projected funding levels shown in Figure 3 would not be sufficient to procure all the ships shown in the 30-year shipbuilding plan.
Previous Navy force structure plans, such as those shown in Table B-1 , might provide some insight into the potential adequacy of a proposed new force-structure plan, but changes over time in mission requirements, technologies available to ships for performing missions, and other force-planning factors, as well as the possibility that earlier force-structure plans might not have been appropriate for meeting the mission demands of their times, suggest that some caution should be applied in using past force structure plans for this purpose, particularly if those past force structure plans are more than a few years old.
""In fact, if you talked to industry, they would say we're underutilizing the facilities that we have."" The areas where the Navy would likely have to adjust ""tooling"" to answer demand for a larger fleet would likely be in Virginia-class attack submarines and large surface combatants, the DDG-51 guided missile destroyers—two ship classes likely to surge if the Navy gets funding to build to 355 ships, he said.
So we have hot production lines that will take us to that 355-ship Navy.""

A January 12, 2017, press report states the following: Brian Cuccias, president of Ingalls Shipbuilding [a shipyard owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) that builds Navy destroyers and amphibious ships as well as Coast Guard cutters], said Ingalls, which is currently building 10 ships for four Navy and Coast Guard programs at its 800-acre facility in Pascagoula, Miss., could build more because it is using only 70 to 75 percent of its capacity.
The entire submarine industrial base at all levels of the supply chain will likely need to recapitalize some portion of its facilities, workforce, and supply chain just to support the current plan to build the Columbia Class SSBN program, while concurrently building Virginia Class SSNs.

159,"Aside from funding, other potential issues of for many in Congress and the research community may include allocating funding across disease types, areas of human health, and types of research; addressing congressional priorities and concerns, while ensuring the scientific merit and quality of NIH-funded research; helping new and early-stage investigators obtain their first independent research grants; maintaining the United States' role as a leader in biomedical research; balancing the public and private sectors' relative roles in biomedical research.
Through continued pressure, offices may then be elevated to centers and, in some cases, to institute status."" The 2003 NAS report noted challenges with NIH's large and decentralized organizational structure, but said that any proposals for changing the number of ICs or OD program offices should be subject to a public evaluation process.
Information from the tracking system assists the Director and DPCPSI in planning trans-NIH research initiatives that cannot be handled within individual ICs. The reporting system, called Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT), ""provides access to reports, data, and analyses of NIH research activities, including information on NIH expenditures and the results of NIH-supported research."" The Reform Act did not contain any provisions on specific diseases or fields of research, nor did it eliminate or consolidate any existing ICs. However, it did provide certain authorities to HHS and NIH officials for making organizational changes to NIH.
The Strategic Plan is expected to provide direction to the biomedical investments made by NIH, facilitate IC collaboration, leverage scientific opportunity, and advance biomedicine (for more information about the 2016-20 NIH-Wide Strategic Plan, see "" NIH Process in Setting Research Priorities ."") The act also changed the biennial report of the NIH Director to Congress to a triennial requirement.
Section 2033 of the 21 st Century Cures Act ( P.L. 115-255 ) added a new requirement that the IC Director weigh the Advisory Board or Council's advice against the IC's mission and research priorities, the NIH-Wide Strategic Plan, and programs or projects funded by other ICs on similar topics before awarding a research grant.
The total NIH budget is called the ""program level."" Discretionary funding for NIH comes primarily from the annual Labor-HHS-Education (LHHS) appropriations bill, which funds the agency through 27 separate accounts, including the 24 ICs with research grant-awarding authority.
The presentations and discussions allow NIH management to develop the budget request it will submit to HHS, taking into account the estimated funding amount needed to support the ""commitment base"" of continuing awards, the funding desired for unsolicited new research proposals, the new initiatives that the Director wants to incorporate, and guidance from the department about the request (e.g., there might be an instruction to pay no inflation increases on grants).
Cures Acceleration Network The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) allows NIH to award large grants of up to $15 million per year (that require a 1:3 matching ratio), and other flexible awards, to ""advance the development of high-need cures and reduce significant barriers between research discovery and clinical trials."" CAN grant recipients can be public or private entities, including institutions of higher education, pharmaceutical companies, and disease advocacy organizations.
The IC strategic planning processes are conducted pursuant to PHSA Section 402(b)(5), which specifies that the NIH Director ""shall ensure that scientifically based strategic planning is implemented in support of research priorities as determined by the agencies of the National Institutes of Health.""  The Cures Act ( P.L. 114-255 ) amended PHSA Section 402 to require an NIH-Wide Strategic Plan, in part to facilitate IC collaboration and coordination.
The report stated, ""The Committee requests an analysis of the projected impact of such a policy change on the number and average cost of NIH grants, as well as on academic institutions, in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Justification""  The FY2020 budget request, again, included the proposal to cap the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds at 90%.
In addition, the FY2020 budget request would provide $100 million in dedicated funding for NGRI, and the request stated:  in response to an advisory committee recommendation and a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences, NIH is creating a new pathway for applications from early-stage investigators that does not require preliminary data and continues to provide a separate review of applications."
160,"President Trump's recently imposed tariff increases are of note because they are significantly higher than average U.S. tariffs (most of the increases are in the range of 10-25%), and have resulted in retaliation of a similar magnitude by some of the countries whose exports to the United States have been subject to the tariff increases; they affect approximately 12% of annual U.S. imports and 8% of U.S. exports, magnitudes that could grow if additional proposed or pending actions are carried out, or decrease if additional negotiated solutions are achieved; they represent a significant shift from recent U.S. trade policy as no President has imposed tariffs under these authorities in nearly two decades; and they have potentially significant implications for U.S. economic activity, the U.S. role in the global trading system, and future U.S. trade negotiations.
Described by the White House as a response to China's ""economic aggression,"" the memorandum identified four broad Chinese IP-related policies to justify U.S. action under Section 301, stating China uses joint venture requirements, foreign investment restrictions, and administrative review and licensing processes to force or pressure technology transfers from American companies; China uses discriminatory licensing processes to transfer technologies from U.S. companies to Chinese companies; China directs and facilitates investments and acquisitions, which generate large-scale technology transfer; and China conducts and supports cyber intrusions into U.S. computer networks to gain access to valuable business information.
These goods are among the top U.S. imports supplied by a number of U.S. trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and the EU, making an increase in U.S. tariffs that applies to these countries economically significant and likely to result in retaliatory action.
As noted, President Trump has warned that he will follow through with his threat to increase Section 301 tariffs on $200 billion worth of products from China from 10% to 25% if a trade agreement is not reached by March 1, 2019, or potentially soon thereafter.
Retaliatory tariffs imposed by China in response to U.S. Section 301 actions affect approximately $101 billion of U.S. annual exports, accounting for about 80% of U.S. exports subject to retaliatory tariffs currently in effect ( Figure 6 ).
Some factors that may create greater pressure for U.S. policy change include (1) demand for the targeted product is price sensitive (i.e., demand is price elastic), therefore a small tariff increase will lead to a sharper decline in exports; (2) the retaliating country is a major world market for the product, in which case the exports may not be easily diverted to other markets; and (3) the producers of the targeted products in the United States (i.e., those negatively affected by the tariffs) have high levels of political influence (e.g., the product is made in congressional districts with Members on key committees).
The Members' letter included specific recommendations, such as allowing for broader product ranges to be included in a single request, allowing trade associations to petition, grandfathering existing contracts to avoid disruptions, and regularly reviewing the tariffs' effects and sunsetting them if they have a ""significant negative impact."" In September 2018, during an oversight hearing, multiple Senators raised concerns directly to the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security at Commerce, about agency management of the Section 232 exclusion process, including staffing and funding levels, and the need for greater transparency, among other issues.
The extent of the price change and its impact on trade flows, employment, and production in the United States and abroad depend on resource constraints and how various economic actors (foreign producers of the goods subject to the tariffs, producers of domestic substitutes, producers in downstream industries, and consumers) respond as the effects of the increased tariffs reverberate throughout the economy.
On July 16, 2018, the United States filed its own WTO complaints over the retaliatory tariffs imposed by five countries (Canada, China, the EU, Mexico, and Turkey) in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports under Section 232."
161,"This treatment occurred because U.S. corporations could defer U.S. tax on active income earned abroad in foreign subsidiaries until it was paid, or repatriated, to the U.S. parent company as a dividend.
The new system also allows U.S. firms a deduction for foreign derived intangible income, or FDII, which was designed to reduce tax rates on foreign earnings from the use of intangible assets held in the United States.
Income from certain foreign sources earned by subsidiaries—which generally includes passive types of income, such as interest, dividends, annuities, rents, and royalties, and is referred to as Subpart F income—is generally taxed in the year it is earned and was retained by the Act. Subpart F applies only to shareholders who may be able to influence location decisions at the corporate level.
Post-2004 Inversions and Treasury Regulations of 2012 Although the 2004 act largely eliminated the generic naked inversions, two alternatives remained that allowed a firm to shift headquarters and retain control of the business: the naked inversion via the business activity exemption, and merger with a smaller company.
The regulations do not prevent inversions via merger and do not address earnings stripping by shifting debt to the U.S. firm, although Treasury has indicated future action in this area.
Treasury Regulations, April 4, 2016 On April 4, 2016, the Treasury Department issued temporary and proposed regulations formalizing rules contained in Notices 2014-52 and 2015-79 limiting corporate tax inversions, as well as adding new rules addressing inversions and earnings-stripping transactions.
Legislative proposals were also under discussion in 2014 by Representative Levin (announced July 31, 2014) and by Senator Schumer (announced August 14, 2014) to address earnings stripping, where foreign parent companies borrow from the U.S. subsidiary to increase interest deductions and reduce taxable income in the United States."
162,"Data Sources  The analysis presented in this report relies on two data sources: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC).
This section of the report explores changes in the income distribution of students enrolled in postsecondary education over time using the NPSAS variable for income as a percentage of the poverty guidelines.
Income Distribution of the National Population and the Undergraduate Population The NPSAS data suggest that low-income students have enrolled in postsecondary education at higher levels in more recent years."
163,"The program has a significant impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders as well as on the economy in general through its coverage of important health care benefits for the aged and disabled, the payment of premiums and other cost sharing by those beneficiaries, its payments to providers who supply those health care services, and its interaction with other insurance coverage.
P.L. 92-603, enacted in 1972, expanded program coverage to certain individuals under 65 (the disabled and persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)), and introduced managed care into Medicare by allowing private insurance entities to provide Medicare benefits in exchange for a monthly capitated payment.
During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of laws were enacted that included provisions designed to further stem the rapid increase in program spending through modifications to the way payments to providers were determined, and to postpone the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund.
The MMA included provisions that (1) created a new voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit to be administered by private entities; (2) replaced the Medicare+Choice program with the Medicare Advantage (MA) program and raised payments to plans in order to increase their availability for beneficiaries; (3) introduced the concept of income testing into Medicare, with higher-income persons paying larger Part B premiums beginning in 2007; (4) modified some provider payment rules; (5) expanded covered preventive services; and (6) created a specific process for overall program review if general revenue spending exceeded a specified threshold.
Included in the ACA, as amended, are provisions that (1) constrain Medicare's annual payment increases for certain providers; (2) change payment rates in the MA program so that they more closely resemble those in fee-for-service; (3) reduce payments to hospitals that serve a large number of low-income patients; (4) create an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make recommendations to adjust Medicare payment rates; (5) phase out the Part D prescription drug benefit ""doughnut hole""; (6) increase resources and enhance activities to prevent fraud and abuse; and (7) provide incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, such as creating value-based purchasing programs for certain types of providers, allowing accountable care organizations (ACOs) that meet certain quality and efficiency standards to share in the savings, creating a voluntary pilot program that bundles payments for physician, hospital, and post-acute care services, and adjusting payments to hospitals for readmissions related to certain potentially preventable conditions.
Additionally, MACRA reduced updates to hospital and post-acute care provider payments, extended several expiring provider payment adjustments, made adjustments to income-related premiums in Parts B and D, and prohibited using Social Security numbers on beneficiaries' Medicare cards.
For example, BBA 18 included provisions designed to expand care for beneficiaries with chronic health conditions, such as promoting team-based care by providers, increasing the use of telehealth services, and expanding certain MA supplemental benefits.
In addition, BBA 18 extended for five years a number of existing Medicare provisions that were set to expire (or that had temporarily expired), including the Medicare dependent hospital program and add-on payments for low-volume hospitals, rural home health services, and certain ambulance services.
MACRA made several fundamental changes to how Medicare pays for physician and practitioner services by (1) changing the methodology for determining the annual updates to the conversion factor, (2) establishing a merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) to consolidate and replace several existing incentive programs and to apply value and quality adjustments to the MPFS, and (3) establishing the development of, and participation in, alternative payment models (APMs).
Additional Insurance Coverage While Medicare provides broad protection against the costs of many, primarily acute care, services, the program does not cover all services that may be used by its aged and disabled beneficiaries."
164,"The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 ( P.L. 102-325 ) limited the eligibility of incarcerated students to HEA Title IV aid in several ways: Individuals who were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and those who were sentenced to death were prohibited from receiving a Pell Grant.
Current Pell Grant Eligibility  Under Department of Education (ED) regulations for HEA Title IV, an incarcerated student is defined as any ""student who is serving a criminal sentence in a federal, state, or local penitentiary, prison, jail, reformatory, work farm, or other similar correctional institution."" The definition does not include an individual who is confined in a correctional facility prior to the imposition of any criminal sentence or juvenile disposition, such as an individual confined in a local jail while awaiting trial.
Specific eligibility requirements for the Pell Grant program that may be germane to criminal justice involved individuals include, but are not limited to, the following: Students must not be incarcerated in a federal or state penal institution.
However, there are several issues policymakers might consider before expanding access to Pell Grants, including overall program costs, whether the federal government should support more research on the effects of postsecondary education in correctional institutions, obstacles to providing access to postsecondary education in a correctional environment, and barriers returning prisoners might face when trying to find post-release employment related to their education."
165,"The provision in the 2018 farm bill is similar to the original version of CREP in that it authorizes USDA to enter into agreements with states to target designated project areas with continuous CRP enrollment contracts.
Projects are designed to address specific environmental objectives through targeted continuous, noncompetitive, CRP enrollment that typically provides additional financial incentives beyond annual rental payments and cost-share assistance.
Other CRP Initiatives CLEAR 30 The 2018 farm bill creates a new pilot program referred to as CLEAR 30, which enrolls expiring CRP land into 30-year contracts devoted to practices that improve water quality.
The new EQIP incentive contracts exhibit some similarities with CSP contracts, including addressing priority resource concerns; and providing annual payments for adopting, maintaining, and improving practices."
166,"similar approval."" The Court inferred this purpose from the principle that ""normally Congress would not want States to forbid, or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly granted.""  Lower courts have followed Barnett Bank 's rule that absent indications to the contrary, federal statutes and regulations that grant national banks the power to engage in specific activities preempt state laws that prohibit or ""significantly interfere"" with those activities.
Finally, Section 1044 abrogated the Supreme Court's decision in Watters , providing that ""State consumer financial laws"" apply to the subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks ""to the same extent"" that they apply ""to any person, corporation, or other entity subject to such State law."" The OCC's 2011 Preemption Rules After Dodd-Frank's enactment, commentators debated the meaning of Section 1044's general preemption standard.
As discussed, Section 1044's preemption standard provides that federal law preempts ""State consumer financial laws"" that ""prevent[] or significantly interfere[]"" with the powers of national banks ""in accordance with the legal standard for preemption in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in [ Barnett Bank ]."" Some commentators have argued that this language simply codifies the Barnett Bank standard and was not intended to significantly modify pre-existing law.
However, others have argued that Section 1044 was intended to pare back the OCC's 2004 preemption rules, which interpreted the NBA as preempting state laws that ""obstruct, impair, or condition"" the powers of national banks."
167,"They include the Bureau of Land Management, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, Land and Water Conservation Fund, National Park Service, Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program, Smithsonian Institution, U.S. Geological Survey, and Wildland Fire Management.
Relative to the FY2018 appropriations in Title II only ($8.06 billion), the EPA would have received a decrease under the Administration's request (23.2%) and under the House-passed bill (1.6%), but it would have received level funding under the Senate-passed bill.
Similar to the House-passed and Senate-passed bills, the FY2019 enacted appropriation did not fund the Special Diabetes Program for Indians through discretionary appropriations, and provided level funding for most Indian Health Facilities programs except for facilities and environmental health support, which received an increase.
U.S. Geological Survey Relative to FY2018 appropriations ($1.15 billion), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) would have received a decrease (25.1%) under the Administration's request, an increase (2.1%) under the House-passed bill, and level funding under the Senate-passed bill."
168,"(The Navy calculated that the unit target cost of $2.0 billion in constant FY2005 dollars for each submarine translated into about $2.6 billion for a boat procured in FY2012.) Schedule and Cost Performance on Deliveries Earlier Record As noted in CRS testimony in 2014, the Virginia (SSN-774) class attack program has been cited as an example of a successful acquisition program.
The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the remaining $7,155.9 million in procurement funding needed to complete the boats' estimated combined procurement cost, as well as $1,887.6 million in ""regular"" AP funding for Virginia-class boats to be procured in future fiscal years and $882.0 million in additional EOQ AP funding for components of boats to be procured under the FY2019-FY2023 MYP contract, bringing the total amount of procurement and AP funding requested for the program in FY2020 to $9,925.5 million (i.e., about $9.9 billion), excluding outfitting and post-delivery costs.
A November 2018 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the issue stated: The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures.
The root cause of submarine idle time and associated loss of operational availability, as discussed in the recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report 19-229, ""Actions Needed to Address Costly Maintenance Delays Facing the Attack Submarine Fleet"" (issued November 2018), is largely due to public shipyard capacity not keeping pace with growing maintenance requirements that have been building for a number of years prior to the USS BOISE (SSN 764) FY 2016 Engineered Overhaul (EOH)."
169,"In charging the defendants for failing to register their business, prosecutors alleged that e-Gold operated as an ""unlicensed money transmitting business"" in each of the three ways identified by Section 1960—the provision criminalizing the operation of ""unlicensed money transmitting businesses."" Specifically, the prosecutors alleged that e-Gold (1) lacked a required state money transmitter license, (2) failed to comply with the BSA's federal registration requirements for ""money transmitting businesses"" (requirements set forth in Section 5330 of Title 31), and (3) was involved in the transmission of funds that were ""known to have been derived from a criminal offense"" or that were ""intended to be used to promote and support unlawful activity."" In defending these charges, the defendants presented an intricate argument for the proposition that Section 1960 applies only to businesses that facilitate cash (as opposed to virtual currency) transactions."

In October 2015, 10 Members of Congress wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to ""work with our Saudi partners to limit civilian casualties to the fullest extent possible."" In October 2015, Senator Markey stated that ""I fear that our failure to strongly advocate diplomacy in Yemen over the past two years, coupled with our failure to urge restraint in the face of the crisis last spring, may put the viability of this critical [U.S.-Saudi] partnership at risk.""  By the fall of 2015, as the Obama Administration tried to balance its concern for adhering to the laws of armed conflict with its support for Gulf partners, lawmakers began to express their concern over U.S. involvement in the coalition's intervention by scrutinizing U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia."
172,"Overview of Unemployment Insurance Programs In general, when eligible workers lose their jobs, the joint federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program may provide up to 26 weeks of income support through regular UC benefit payments.
However, according to guidance from U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), excepted federal employees who are performing services (but working without pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of ""unemployment."" Private-sector workers who are furloughed or laid off due to the partial government shutdown because they were employed by government contractors or other businesses may be eligible for regular UC benefits."
173,"Introduction A variety of issues related to housing were active during the 115 th Congress, including issues related to housing finance, housing-related tax provisions, housing assistance and grant programs (including in response to presidentially declared major disasters), and actions undertaken by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as part of its efforts to review existing department regulations.
Despite concerns about the affordability of owner-occupied housing, many metrics suggest that homeownership is currently relatively affordable by historical standards; however, such measures generally focus on the ability of households to afford monthly mortgage payments and do not consider other costs of purchasing a home, such as saving for a down payment.
Therefore, rising incomes and, especially, interest rates that are still low by historical standards contribute to homes, and borrowers' monthly mortgage payments in particular, being considered affordable despite recent house price increases.
Although new rental housing units have also been created, both through new construction and as some formerly owner-occupied homes are converted to rentals, in many markets the rise in the number of renters increased competition for rental housing, leading to lower rental vacancy rates and higher rents in recent years.
Provisions of the act that modify mortgage-related requirements that were put in place after the housing market turmoil include the following:  allowing certain mortgages originated and held in portfolio by small depository institutions to be considered ""qualified mortgages"" for the purposes of complying with the ability-to-repay rule; making changes to requirements related to certain property appraisals; exempting some banks and credit unions that make fewer than a particular number of mortgage loans from specified new reporting requirements under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA); providing grace periods for individuals working as mortgage originators to obtain the proper licensing to originate mortgages in their new positions when they move from banks to nonbanks or across state lines; expanding the circumstances under which manufactured home retailers and their employees can be excluded from the definition of mortgage originators, and therefore exempt from certain requirements that apply to mortgage originators, subject to specified conditions; and waiving the waiting period between receipt of particular mortgage-related disclosures and the mortgage closing when a borrower is offered a lower interest rate after initial receipt of the disclosures.
These include the following: requirements intended to address concerns about certain refinancing practices related to some mortgages guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs; making permanent specified protections for renters in foreclosed properties that had been put in place by the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (Title VII of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, P.L. 111-22 ) in 2009 but had since expired; making permanent a one-year protection against foreclosure for active duty servicemembers under particular circumstances; requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider alternative credit scoring models for mortgages purchased by those institutions; making Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loans, which allow some homeowners to finance specified energy improvements through property tax assessments, subject to the ability-to-repay requirements that apply to most mortgages; certain changes related to small public housing agencies; changes to HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency program, an asset-building program for residents of public and assisted housing; and requiring certain reports, including a report by HUD on lead paint hazards and abatement and a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on foreclosures in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
These provisions directed the HUD Secretary to (1) streamline the recertification process for FHA approval of condominium buildings to make it less burdensome, (2) make changes to the process for granting exceptions for exceeding FHA's limits on commercial space, (3) adopt Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regulations related to transfer fees and condominiums, and (4) issue new guidance, and a justification, addressing the required percentage of owner-occupied units in the building.
The increase in tax credits included in P.L. 115-141 may help to alleviate concerns about the potential impact of the tax revision law on the price for LIHTCs. A dditional information: For more information on the low-income housing tax credit in general, and these recent changes to the program, see CRS Report RS22389, An Introduction to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit .
This legislation was not enacted before the end of the 115 th Congress.H.R. 1511 , the Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2017, ordered to be reported by the House Financial Services Committee in July 2018 (on a vote of 39-18), would have expanded the definition of homelessness governing the HUD homeless programs, while maintaining existing resources for the programs, to include homeless families with children and youth certified as homeless under other federal programs that have less-restrictive definitions."
174,"For example, ED receives both mandatory and discretionary appropriations; ED is annually provided forward funds and advance appropriations for some—but not all—discretionary programs; ED awards both formula and competitive grants; and a portion of ED's budget subsidizes student loan costs (through both direct loans and loan guarantees).
That is, ED had legal authority to spend up to $16.805 billion in federal funds for the purposes associated with this account (which consists primarily of grants allocated to local educational agencies).
Appropriations measures, on the other hand, are typically enacted annually and provide new budget authority for agencies, programs, policies, and activities that are already authorized and are under the jurisdiction of the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee.
For example, P.L. 115-245 provided budget authority that was available for one year for ED's Indian Education account, a year-and-a-quarter for Special Education, and two years for Impact Aid. In general, during a calendar year Congress may consider the following: 12 regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that begins on October 1 (often referred to as the budget year) to provide the annual funding for the agencies, projects, and activities funded therein; one or more continuing resolutions for that same fiscal year, to provide temporary funding if all 12 regular appropriations bills are not enacted by the start of the fiscal year; and one or more supplemental appropriations measures for the current fiscal year, to provide additional funding for selected activities over and above the amount provided through annual or continuing appropriations.
For example, Section 1002 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended and reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, P.L. 114-95 ), includes an authorization of appropriations provision effectively recommending a specific funding level ($15.9 billion) for the Title I-A program in a certain fiscal year (FY2019).

175,"The report next covers the following crosscutting topics: funding and financing aging and new water resource projects, changing from federal infrastructure projects to federal partnerships, protecting and restoring the environment, flood resilience and natural and nature-based infrastructure, and recharging groundwater.
Such issues may include, for example, the status of new and proposed water storage projects; dam safety issues at existing federal reclamation projects; and efforts to address the agency's aging infrastructure and transition projects to nonfederal ownership.
The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) is an international agreement between the United States and Canada for the cooperative development and operation of the water resources of the Columbia River basin to provide for flood control and power.
Under the WIIN Act, Congress provided general authority for Reclamation to support new and enhanced federal and state surface and groundwater storage projects under certain, limited circumstances."
176,"Across these decades, the breadth of policy areas addressed through such farm bills has expanded beyond providing support for a limited number of agricultural commodities to include establishing programs and policies that address a broad spectrum of related areas.
These titles cover commodity support programs, agricultural conservation, trade and international food aid, domestic nutrition assistance, credit, rural development, research and extension, forestry, horticulture, crop insurance, and a variety of other policies and initiatives.
The 2018 farm bill expands these SNAP incentive programs, increasing mandatory funding, and, within FINI's funding, establishes grants for produce prescription projects to serve individuals eligible for SNAP or Medicaid in households with or at risk of developing a diet-related health condition.
The law adds a new section to the Rural Development Act of 1972 authorizing the Secretary to temporarily prioritize assistance under certain USDA Rural Development loan and grant programs to respond to a public health emergency.
Research22 USDA is authorized under four major laws to conduct agricultural research at the federal level and to provide support for cooperative research, extension, and postsecondary agricultural education programs in the states through formula funds and competitive grants to land-grant universities (see Table 11 ).
Forestry23 Similar to previous farm bills, the forestry title in the enacted 2018 farm bill ( P.L. 115-334 , Title VIII) includes provisions related to forestry research and establishes, modifies, or repeals several programs to provide financial and technical assistance to nonfederal forest landowners (see Table 12 ).
The House-passed version would have established 10 other categorical exclusions for various activities and would have also changed some of the consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The enacted farm bill also includes provisions from the House bill related to the Forest Service's authority to designate insect and disease treatment areas on NFS lands and procedures intended to expedite the environmental analysis for specified priority projects within those areas.

Crucially, Article II also empowers the President to hold executive branch officers accountable, through removal if necessary, which the Supreme Court in Myers v.
1735 , introduced in the 115 th Congress, would have provided that in order to remove a special counsel, the Attorney General must first file an action with a three-judge court; if that panel issues a finding of ""misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause, including violation of policies of the Department of Justice,"" then a special counsel may be removed.
Olson , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a federal prosecutor can be insulated from executive control in the context of the now-expired Independent Counsel Act. Morrison upheld the independent counsel statute, which, as discussed above, vested the appointment of an independent counsel outside of the executive branch and limited the removal authority of the President.
As noted above, in Morrison , the Court examined whether Congress had impermissibly interfered with the President's constitutional duties; it approved of the independent counsel statute's provisions that, among other things, (1) required good cause to remove the independent counsel; (2) largely restricted the Attorney General's discretion in deciding to request the appointment of an independent counsel; and (3) placed the actual power of appointment with a panel of Article III judges.
That bill would bar the removal of a special counsel unless the Attorney General first files a petition with a three-judge court, and that court itself finds ""misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause, including violation of policies of the Department of Justice."" Inserting the judiciary into a removal decision, by requiring a court to determine in the first instance the grounds for the dismissal of an executive branch official before he may be removed, appears to go beyond the restrictions on the President's removal power previously approved by the Supreme Court in Humphrey ' s Executor and Morrison ."
178,"President Trump announced a new policy approach toward Cuba in June 2017 that partially rolled back efforts to normalize relations and imposed new sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on the permissible category of people-to-people educational travel to Cuba and on transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military.
It is divided into three major sections analyzing: (1) Cuba's political and economic environment; (2) U.S. policy toward Cuba; and (3) selected issues in U.S.-Cuban relations, including restrictions on travel and trade, democracy and human rights funding for Cuba, U.S. government-sponsored radio and television broadcasting to Cuba (Radio and T Martí), migration issues, antidrug cooperation, property claims, and U.S. fugitives from justice in Cuba.
In 2008, Cuba lifted a ban on Cubans staying in hotels that previously had been restricted to foreign tourists in a policy that had been pejoratively referred to as ""tourist apartheid."" In recent years, as the government has enacted limited economic reforms, it has been much more open to debate on economic issues.
In October 2018, the State Department's U.S. Mission to the United Nations launched a campaign to call attention to the plight of Cuba's ""estimated 130 political prisoners."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote an open letter to Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in December 2018, asking for a substantive explanation for the continued detention of eight specific political prisoners and an explanation of the charges and evidence against other individuals held as political prisoners.
According to the State Department's human rights report on Cuba covering 2018, issued in March 2019, the government refused international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations access to its prisons and detention centers, and closely monitored and often harassed domestic human rights organizations.
Key sectors of the economy that generate foreign exchange include the export of professional services (largely medical personnel to Venezuela); tourism, which has grown significantly since the mid-1990s, with an estimated 4.75 million tourists visiting Cuba in 2018; nickel mining, with the Canadian mining company Sherritt International involved in a joint investment project; and a biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector that supplies the domestic health care system and has fostered a significant export industry.
The CACR, which include a prohibition on most financial transactions with Cuba and a freeze of Cuban government assets in the United States, remain the main body of Cuba embargo regulations and have been amended many times over the years to reflect changes in policy.
President Obama said that his Administration would ""end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests."" He maintained that the United States would continue to raise concerns about democracy and human rights in Cuba but stated that ""we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement.""  The policy change included three major steps: (1) the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism in May 2015; (2) the restoration of diplomatic relations in July 2015 (relations had been severed in January 1961 by the Eisenhower Administration); and (3) steps to increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to Cuba.
He stated that ""any changes to the relationship between the United States and Cuba will depend on real progress toward these and other goals."" Once Cuba takes concrete steps in these areas, President Trump said ""we will be ready, willing and able to come to the table to negotiate that much better deal for Cubans, for Americans."" The new policy leaves many of the Obama-era policy changes in place, including the reestablishment of diplomatic relations and a variety of eased sanctions to increase travel and commerce with Cuba.
The new policy also keeps in place the Obama Administration's action ending the so-called wet foot/dry foot policy toward Cuban migrants, which, according to the NSPM, had ""encouraged untold thousands of Cuban nationals to risk their lives to travel unlawfully to the United States."" The most significant policy changes set forth in President Trump's NSPM include (1) restrictions on financial transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel and (2) the elimination of people-to-people educational travel by individuals.
(For further background, see "" U.S. Response to Health Injuries of U.S. Personnel in Havana "" below.) ""Troika of Tyranny."" In a November 2018 address in Miami, FL, National Security Adviser John Bolton strongly criticized the Cuban government on human rights, stating that ""we will only engage with a Cuban government that is willing to undertake necessary and tangible reforms—a government that respects the interests of the Cuban people."" Bolton's speech, full of anti-communist political discourse reminiscent of the Cold War era, referred to Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a ""troika of tyranny"" and the ""cause of immense human suffering, the impetus of enormous regional instability, and the genesis of a sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere."" He referred to the three countries' leaders as ""three stooges of socialism"" and as ""clownish pitiful figures."" Bolton asserted that the Venezuelan regime's repression has been ""enabled by the Cuban dictatorship."" In 2019, as the political situation in Venezuela has deteriorated and the United States has ramped up sanctions on the Maduro regime, the Trump Administration has increased its criticism of Cuba's support for the regime.
Then, on March 4, Secretary Pompeo partially suspended the right to file lawsuits for an additional 30 days (through April 17) but allowed lawsuits, beginning March 19, against an entity or subentity on the State Department's ""Cuba Restricted List"" controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services.
The Trump Administration's policy of rolling back some of the Obama-era changes and introducing new sanctions on Cuba also has highlighted divisions in Congress over Cuba policy, with some Members supporting the President's action because of Cuba's lack of progress on human rights and others opposing it because of the potential negative effect on the Cuban people and U.S. business interests.
According to the State Department's 2019 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), issued in March 2019, Cuba has 40 bilateral agreements for antidrug cooperation with countries worldwide, including the 2016 U.S.-Cuban agreement noted above."
179,"After meeting with President Kagame in Davos in January 2018, President Trump praised the United States' ""great relationships"" with Rwanda, including bilateral trade, and stated that ""the job they've done is absolutely terrific."" In September 2017 congressional testimony, then Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Yamamoto praised Rwanda's ""remarkable gains"" in health and development and characterized the country as ""a major contributor to regional peace and security,"" while asserting that ""Rwanda's record in the areas of human rights and democracy, while improved in some areas, remains a concern."" He called on the government ""to take steps toward a democratic transition of power.""  Regarding Rwanda's 2017 presidential election, the State Department stated that ""we are disturbed by irregularities observed during voting and reiterate long-standing concerns over the integrity of the vote-tabulation process."" In response to Member questions at the September 2017 hearing, Ambassador Yamamoto affirmed that ""we are unable to assess this election as free and fair."" At his Senate confirmation hearing in late 2017, the U.S. Ambassador-designate to Rwanda described his four top policy goals as the following: continuing the United States' ""development partnership"" with Rwanda, promoting U.S. business and economic ties, supporting Rwanda's continued peacekeeping role, and advancing ""democratic ideals."" President Trump suspended duty-free treatment of Rwandan apparel exports to the United States under AGOA in 2018, as noted above, citing Rwandan protectionist policies.
FY2014: The Obama Administration continued to suspend FMF, consistent with a provision in that year's appropriations act ( P.L. 113-76 , §7042(l) of Division K) restricting such funds unless Rwanda was ""taking steps to cease"" support to certain armed groups in DRC."
180,"Terrorism Loss Sharing Criteria To meet the first goal, the TRIA program creates a mechanism through which the federal government could share insured commercial property and casualty losses with the private insurance market.
7. In the years following the federal sharing of insurer losses, but prior to September 30, 2024, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to establish surcharges on TRIA-eligible property and casualty insurance policies to recoup 140% of some or all of the outlays to insurers under the program.
The general result of the recoupment provisions is that, for attacks that result in under $37.5 billion in insured losses, the Treasury Secretary is required to recoup 140% of the government outlays through surcharges on property and casualty insurance policies."
181,"Later, multilevel government responses to disasters such as Hurricane Katrina expanded the concept of homeland security to include disasters, public health emergencies, and other events that threaten the United States, its economy, the rule of law, and government operations.
the protection of U.S. sovereignty, territory, domestic population, and critical defense infrastructure against external threats and aggression, or other threats as directed by the President."" Homeland security, on the other hand, is a more broadly coordinated effort, involving not only military activities, but the operations of civilian agencies at all levels of government.
Analyzing Costs Across Government Section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 required the President's annual budget request to include an analysis of homeland security funding across the federal government—not just DHS.
The resulting data series, which included agency-reported data on spending in three categories—preventing and disrupting terrorist attacks; protecting the American people, critical infrastructure, and key resources; and responding to and recovering from incidents—provides a limited snapshot of the scope of the federal government's investment in homeland security.
OIA combines information collected by DHS components as part of their operational activities (i.e., those conducted at airports, seaports, and the border) with foreign intelligence from the IC; law enforcement information from federal, state, local, territorial and tribal sources; and private sector data about critical infrastructure and strategic resources.
In December 2015, the joint explanatory statement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ) stated that DHS ""lacks a mechanism for capturing and understanding research and development (R&D) activities conducted across DHS, as well as coordinating R&D to reflect departmental priorities."" A challenge for external coordination is that the majority of homeland security-related R&D is conducted by other agencies, most notably the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.
Potential Issues for Congress The Administration's proposal appears to authorize the USMS to staff all protective details of executive branch officials (excluding the USSS and the Departments of State and Defense) deemed to need security, even protective security details that presently are staffed by agencies' employees.
As authorized in part by the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA; P.L. 109-295 ), the President, acting through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator, is directed to create a ""national preparedness goal"" (NPG) and develop a ""national preparedness system"" (NPS) that will help ""ensure the Nation's ability to prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters"" (6 U.S.C.
Congress may have interest in overseeing a variety of factors related to the NPS, such as whether the NPS conforms to the objectives of Congress, as outlined in the PKEMRA statute; the NPS is properly informed by quantitative and qualitative data and outcome metrics, such as those gathered by the THIRA and SPR, as has been regularly recommended by the Government Accountability Office; federal roles and responsibilities have, in Congress's opinion, been properly assigned and resourced to execute the core capabilities needed to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from the greatest risks; nonfederal resources and stakeholders are efficiently incorporated into NPS policies; and federal, state, and local government officials are allocating the appropriate amount of resources to the disaster preparedness mission relative to other homeland security missions.
§§5121 et seq.), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may provide various temporary housing assistance programs to meet disaster survivors' needs.
The NFIP has two main policy goals: (1) to provide access to primary flood insurance, thereby allowing for the transfer of some of the financial risk from property owners to the federal government, and (2) to mitigate and reduce the nation's comprehensive flood risk through the development and implementation of floodplain management standards.
In response, Congress established firefighter assistance grant programs within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide additional support for local fire departments.
Congress may also focus on the activities of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB), which administers FCC policies related to emergency communications, including rules for carriers supporting 911 services; state and local use of 911 fees; public safety spectrum; public alerts, including rules for carriers delivering wireless alerts to mobile phones; disaster management and reporting of private network outages; and restoration efforts."
182,"Service of Indicted Members on Committees H.Res. 6 amended clause 10 of Rule XXIII, adding a provision that calls on any Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner who has been indicted or formally charged with a felony offense that is punishable by at least two years in prison to resign from committee assignments and party caucus or conference leadership positions.
According to the Rules Committee's summary of H.Res. 6, the ""change is intended to grant committees adequate time to organize, as some committees do not have a full complement of members at the start of a Congress."" Hearing and Markup Procedure Requiring Committee Hearing and Markup on Bills and Joint Resolutions In a separate order, the rules package requires that, during the 116 th Congress, after March 1, 2019, certain lawmaking measures must be reported and be subject to related committee hearings and a markup prior to floor consideration."
183,"The Ford -class design uses the basic Nimitz -class hull form but incorporates several improvements, including features permitting the ship to generate more aircraft sorties per day, more electrical power for supporting ship systems, and features permitting the ship to be operated by several hundred fewer sailors than a Nimitz -class ship, reducing 50-year life-cycle operating and support (O&S) costs for each ship by about $4 billion compared to the Nimitz -class design, the Navy estimates.
1356 / P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015) further amended the cost cap for the CVN-78 program to provide a revised cap of $11,398.0 million for each follow-on ship in the program, plus adjustment for inflation and other factors, and with a new provision stating that, if during construction of CVN-79, the Chief of Naval Operations determines that measures required to complete the ship within the revised cost cap shall result in an unacceptable reduction to the ship's operational capability, the Secretary of the Navy may increase the CVN-79 cost cap by up to $100 million (i.e., to $11.498 billion).
In an August 2, 2017, letter to the congressional defense committees, then-Acting Secretary of the Navy Sean Stackley notified the committees that under subsection (b)(7) of Section 122 of P.L. 114-92 as amended by Section 121 of P.L. 113-66 —a subsection allowing increases to the cost cap for CVN-78 for ""the amounts of increases or decreases in costs of that ship that are attributable solely to an urgent and unforeseen requirement identified as a result of the shipboard test program""—he had increased the cost cap for CVN-78 by $20 million, to $12,907.0 million.
McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 ( H.R. 5515 / P.L. 115-232 of August 13, 2018)—the provision that authorized the two-ship block buy contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81—subsection (a)(1) specifically authorizes a contract for the procurement of CVN-81 ""beginning with the fiscal year 2019 program year."" The header for subsection (a)(1) is ""Procurement Authorized."" Consistent with Section 121(a)(1), the funding table for the Navy's shipbuilding account in the conference report ( H.Rept.
This paragraph also states that ""the funds made available by this Act for the Carrier Replacement Program (CVN-80) may be available to modify or enter into a new contract for the procurement of a Ford-class aircraft carrier designated CVN–81 pursuant to section 121 of the John S.
At a November 27, 2018, hearing on Navy shipbuilding programs before the Seapower subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the following exchange occurred: SENATOR TIM KAINE (continuing):  There have been challenges with the advanced weapons elevators on the CVN, some of the technical difficult[ies] seem similar to those that were experienced earlier on both the [aircraft] launch and arresting systems.
As noted in previous annual reports, the CVN 78 test schedule has been aggressive, and the development of EMALS [Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System], AAG [Advanced Arresting gear], AWE [Advanced Weapons Elevator], DBR [Dual Band Radar], and the Integrated Warfare System delayed the ship's first deployment to FY22.
Other Program Issues CVN 78's procurement costs increased by 23 percent over its initial cost cap and as a result of continuing technical deficiencies, the Navy may still require more funding to complete this ship.
The program also stated that, with CVN 79 construction 55 percent complete, shipbuilder cost performance remains stable, but slightly below the level needed to achieve production labor hour reduction targets.
Ford-class aircraft carriers while saving money it is starting to look at future carrier procurement, which might be very different.… Modly said Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer sees $13 billion carriers as not sustainable going forward and the service will be looking at ways to further reduce costs or keep the carrier capabilities more affordable in future ship procurements.
Until it was withdrawn, the proposal in the Navy's FY2020 budget submission to not fund CVN-75's RCOH and instead decommission the ship (and a carrier air wing) raised a number of potential oversight issues for Congress, including the following: Compliance with congressional direction.
Compared to DOD's estimate that the two-ship block buy contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81 would produce savings of $3.9 billion (as measured from estimated costs for the two ships in the December 2017 Navy business case analysis), DOD states that ""the Department of Defense's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) developed an Independent Estimate of Savings for the two-ship procurement and forecast savings of $3.1 billion ([in] Then-Year [dollars]), or approximately 11 percent....
September 2017 Press Report A September 26, 2017, press report states the following: Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. is falling short of a U.S. Navy goal to reduce hours of labor on the second ship in the new Ford class of aircraft carriers in a drive to reduce costs, according to service documents.
June 2017 GAO Report A June 2017 GAO report states the following: The cost estimate for the second Ford-Class aircraft carrier, CVN 79, is not reliable and does not address lessons learned from the performance of the lead ship, CVN 78.
Navy analysis shows that the CVN 79 cost estimate may not sufficiently account for program risks, with the current budget likely insufficient to complete ship construction.
Based on lessons learned on CVN 78, the approach to carrier construction has undergone an extensive affordability review and the Navy and the shipbuilder have made significant changes on CVN 79 to reduce the cost to build the ship.
Low or unknown reliability and performance of the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), the Dual Band Radar (DBR), and the Advanced Weapons Elevators (AWE) are significant risks to a successful IOT&E and first deployment, as well as to achieving the life-cycle cost reductions the Navy has estimated will accrue for the Ford-class carriers.
The Secretary of the Navy directed a detailed review of the CVN 78 program build plan to improve end-to-end aircraft carrier design, material procurement, production planning, build and test, the results of which are providing benefit across all carriers.
July 2015 Press Report A July 2, 2015, press report states the following: The Navy plans to spend $25 million per year beginning in 2017 as a way to invest in lowering the cost of building the services' new Ford-class aircraft carriers, service officials said.
As a result of lessons learned on CVN 78, the approach to carrier construction has undergone an extensive affordability review; and the Navy and the shipbuilder have made significant changes on CVN 79 that will reduce the cost to build the ship.
The Navy continues implementing actions from the 2012 detailed review of the FORD-Class build plan to control cost and improve performance across lead and follow ship contracts.
At that time, I reported the current estimate for the Navy's share of the shipbuilder's construction overrun, $690 million, and described that I had directed an end-to-end review to identify the changes necessary to improve cost for carrier design, material procurement, planning, build and test."
184,"In addition to the Twenty-Second Amendment cited above, the Twelfth, ratified in 1804, set the same qualifications for the Vice President; the Twentieth, ratified in 1933, set January 20 of every year following a presidential election as the date on which the chief executive's term begins; and the Twenty-Fifth Amendment clarified the question of vice-presidential succession to the presidency and authorized the President to nominate persons to fill vacancies in the vice presidency, subject to approval by vote of both houses of Congress.
Since that time, most proposed amendments related to the President's term and tenure have (1) called either for a six-year presidential term, usually without the possibility of reelection; or (2) proposed repeal of the Twenty-Second Amendment, allowing individuals to be elected President more than twice.
In addition, most contained a variant of the existing Twenty-Second Amendment provision for Vice Presidents who succeed to the highest office: they would be eligible for election in their own right to a term as President provided they had served less than three years of the term to which their predecessor was elected.
History of Congressional Activity As noted earlier, the proposal to establish a single six-year term for the President and Vice President was a hardy perennial from the early days of the republic: 212 such amendments were introduced between the 19 th through 104 th Congresses.
Beyond the immediate ambit of legislative proposals, the idea, if not the reality, of repealing the Twenty-Second Amendment does appear to gain publicity and a level of at least theoretical support when term-limited Presidents approach the end of their time in office.
Supporters of presidential term limits in general and the Twenty-Second Amendment in particular argue that eight years is time enough for any individual in a position of such great power as the presidency of the United States.
The Democratic National Convention responded to Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid by adopting a plank in its 1912 platform that called for ""an amendment to the Constitution making the President of the United States ineligible to reelection."" Following the election, the Democratic-controlled 62 nd Congress moved to implement the proposal, and a single-term amendment passed the Senate by the requisite two-thirds majority in February 1913, even before Wilson's inauguration.
The amendment, which was proposed to the states on March 2, 1932, included the following provisions: Terms of the President and Vice President would end on January 20 of the year following a presidential election.
The Senate version of the amendment, as agreed to in the House and proposed to the states, included the following provisions: No person could be elected to the office of President more than twice."
185,"In general, employees of state and local governments are covered by the overtime provisions of the FLSA and thus are affected by EAP rulemaking updating the salary level threshold for the EAP exemptions.
The main changes to the EAP exemptions in the 2019 proposed rule, as summarized in Table 1 , include the following: an increase in the salary level test from the current $455 per week ($23,660 annually) to $679 per week ($35,308 annually); an increase in the annual salary threshold for the HCE exemption from $100,000 to $147,414; an allowance that up to 10% of the standard salary level may be comprised of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions; a salary level of $455 per week for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and of $380 in American Samoa; and an increase in the ""base rate"" weekly salary level for employees in the motion picture industry from $695 per week to $1,036 per week."
186,"In contrast, standing program authorizations provide project funding for other agencies, including the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Most recently, amendments to Title XVI enacted in December 2016 in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act, P.L. 114-322 ) made changes to the program, including authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to accept and review nonfederal feasibility studies for potential planning, design, and construction projects.
The WIIN Act provided DOI with additional authority to accept nonfederal feasibility studies and approve and consider these projects for construction funding if they meet Title XVI program criteria, including that (1) the study complies with federal laws and regulations applicable to water reuse and recycling studies, and (2) the project is technically and financially feasible and provides a federal benefit in accordance with Reclamation laws.
Since 1992, Congress has enacted more than 400 authorizations allowing USACE to provide designated communities, counties, and states with design and construction assistance for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure (including treatment, and distribution/collection facilities) and source water protection and development; these activities are known as environmental infrastructure projects.
The law directs that USDA make grants of 1% to 3% of total grant funding to qualified nonprofits to provide technical assistance and training to help communities in preparing applications for grants and loans and to help problem solving operation and maintenance of existing water and waste disposal facilities in rural areas.
The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) authorized $5 million per year through FY2018 for USDA to make grants to private nonprofit organizations for the purpose of providing loans to eligible individuals for construction, refurbishing, and servicing of individually owned household water well systems.
Title VII (Section 780) provided an additional $500 million for the grant and loan program ""of which not to exceed $495,000,000 shall be for grants."" Out of the total FY2018 funds, USDA has appropriations of $1.0 million for grants to capitalize revolving loans for water and waste disposal systems and $68 million to support water and waste disposal projects in the colonias, Alaskan Native communities, and Hawaiian Native communities.
To help communities meet these federal mandates and to meet the act's public health objectives, Congress amended the SDWA in 1996 to establish a drinking water state revolving fund (DWSRF) loan program.
Eligibility Requirements There are three categories of recipients eligible for direct allocations of CDBG program funds: entitlement communities (including insular areas), states, and Section 107 special project grants.

187,"As Rule XV states, ""the Speaker may not entertain a motion that the House suspend the rules except on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays and during the last six days of a session of Congress."" Suspension measures, however, may be considered on other days by unanimous consent or under the terms of a special order of business (special rule) reported by the Committee on Rules and agreed to by the House.
Members of the House or Senate minority parties sponsored 31% of all suspension measures originating in either chamber, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and special rules (one Senate bill)."
188,"To do this, the report first examines historical trends in federal spending and revenue policy to illustrate both the challenges and trade-offs inherent to making choices between (1) limiting the provision of defense and domestic public goods, (2) reducing transfers to persons including entitlements for the elderly and those with low income, (3) reducing support for state and local governments, and (4) raising taxes.
Therefore, to address the budget shortfalls facing the country over the long run, it is likely that (1) transfer payments, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, to or on behalf of individuals (which already account for half of federal spending and are growing) must be reduced; (2) transfers to state and local governments must be reduced (which would shift the budget decisions to a different level of government); (3) taxes must be raised; or some combination of the three.
Reductions in discretionary spending are insufficient to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level; thus, limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in mandatory spending, including entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
Federal Spending: Patterns over Time The objectives of government spending and taxes are generally viewed as providing for public and quasi-public goods, such as defense, law enforcement, infrastructure, and education; correcting market failures, including externalities (both negative, such as pollution, and positive, such as research and development); achieving distributive justice; and managing business cycles.
Nondefense discretionary funding, although small as a share of the budget and of GDP, is largely the spending that many people think of when they think of the direct provision of goods and services by the federal government.
(This table does not include earnings from interest on government securities held by the funds and transfers of income taxes collected on Social Security benefits; it also does not reflect administrative costs.) As indicated in the table, OASI payroll tax revenue (as a percentage of GDP) has declined over the past 11 years, while payments have increased substantially.
The Solutions Initiative III proposals all choose to raise additional revenue, which reduces the required cutbacks in Social Security and health spending to address the long-run deficit."

190,"2008 Department of Defense (DOD) Policy on Cluster Munitions25 The Barack Obama Administration announced on November 25, 2011, that the United States would continue to implement the DOD policy on cluster munitions issued June 19, 2008, which recognized the need to minimize harm to civilians and infrastructure but also reaffirmed that ""cluster munitions are legitimate weapons with clear military utility."" The central directive in the Pentagon's policy was the unwaiverable requirement that cluster munitions used after 2018 must leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield."
191,"Background and Historical Context The United States has cultivated intelligence liaison relations with foreign partners through (1) the exchange of information, raw data, or finished intelligence; (2) basing rights for conducting intelligence operations, or privileges to host technical intelligence equipment; (3) burden sharing in the collection and reporting on issues of mutual interest; (4) joint covert action, collection, or exploitation operations; and (5) training.
U.S. intelligence exchange relationships with foreign partners, therefore, often reflect the high level of trust and professional confidence the U.S. IC places in partnerships with particular foreign allies' intelligence services, involving a broad range of overlapping national security, political, and economic interests.
A fundamental assumption, supported by decades of experience, is that building and maintaining these partnerships enhances U.S. national security by providing some benefit that the U.S. would otherwise lack: access to otherwise inaccessible or hostile targets, corroboration of sources, cultural or linguistic expertise, the capacity to conduct joint assessments, providing indications and warning of an attack, obtaining basing rights, or jointly planning and conducting covert operations or intelligence collection.
Early Years The earliest efforts by the United States to formally cooperate with foreign partners in intelligence took place during World War I, when the British and French provided training, advice, and tactical intelligence exchanges with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) under General John Pershing.
Counterintelligence collected by a foreign intelligence partner (to support its own internal national security) and shared with the United States that includes information on U.S. persons requires special handling."
192,"The stated purposes of NVRA are to establish procedures to increase the number of eligible citizens registered to vote in federal elections; enable enhanced voter participation in federal elections; protect the integrity of the electoral process; and ensure accurate voter registration records.
Major Provisions of NVRA NVRA's shorthand name, the motor-voter bill, refers to one of its more well-known provisions—the requirement that states establish procedures for eligible individuals to register to vote in federal elections, or to update their voter registration records, simultaneously with their applications for motor vehicle driver's licenses or for any other form of personal identification provided by the state's department of motor vehicles (DMVs).
Maintenance and Updates to State Voter Lists As noted above, agencies providing voter registration forms, including DMVs, are required by NVRA to accept completed forms from applicants and transmit the forms to the appropriate state election official within 10 days of receipt.
The FEC was responsible for providing information to states about their responsibilities under NVRA; developing a mail-based federal voter registration form; and producing a biennial report to Congress, in consultation with states' chief election officers."
193,"Although the agreements rarely forced either side to accept significant changes in i ts planned nuclear forces, the arms control process, and the formal negotiations, were often one of the few channels for communication between the United States and Soviet Union.
In a speech in Prague in April 2009, the President outlined an agenda that included the pursuit of a new strategic arms control treaty with Russia, efforts to secure the ratification and entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the eventual negotiation of a Fissile Material Control Treaty.
The United States and Russia signed the 2010 New START Treaty, and have completed the implementation of its modest reductions, but there was little evidence of progress toward discussions on further reductions on nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, in 2015, the United States, Russia, and other nations reached an agreement with Iran that restricted Iran's nuclear program and introduced new, extensive international monitoring mechanisms to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.
Moreover, while some would argue that growing tensions between the United States and Russia strengthen the case for further negotiated limits on U.S. and Russian forces, the Trump Administration, and the Obama Administration in its later years, notes that Russia is not, at this time, willing to pursue such agreements.
Because these arms control arrangements affect U.S. national security, military programs, force levels, and defense spending, Congress has shown a continuing interest in the implementation of existing agreements and the prospects for further negotiations.
However, the U.S. Senate's rejection of the CTBT, the Bush Administration's withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002, and the U.S. rejection of a verification protocol for the Biological Weapons Convention led many nations to question the U.S. commitment to the arms control process.
During the Bush Administration, the United States outlined new initiatives in nonproliferation policy that took a far less formal approach, with voluntary guidelines and voluntary participation replacing treaties and multilateral conventions.
And, where the Bush Administration focused its efforts on denying these weapons to specific nations or groups who might threaten the United States, the Obama Administration adopted the more general goals of establishing and supporting international norms and regimes to control these weapons, regardless of which nations might seek them.
For example, in a speech in Moscow in July 2009, President Obama noted that ""the notion that prestige comes from holding these weapons, or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have these weapons, is an illusion."" He went on to state that stopping the spread of nuclear weapons ""is not about singling out individual nations—it's about the responsibilities of all nations."" The Trump Administration has offered some support for existing arms control and nonproliferation tools; it noted, in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, that the United States continues to support the goals of the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and that it would continue to abide by the terms of the 2010 New START Treaty, although it had not decided whether to extend it past 2021.
These provide a list of treaties and agreements that the United States is a party to, a description of the treaty ratification process, and a list of the bilateral and international organizations tasked with implementation of arms control efforts.
Other analysts argued that the Treaty would allow the Soviet Union to maintain strategic superiority over the United States because the Soviet force of large, land-based ballistic missiles would be able to carry far greater numbers of warheads, even within the equal limits on delivery vehicles, than U.S. ballistic missiles.
The Bush Administration rejected that approach; it noted that the new Moscow Treaty (described below) called for further reductions in offensive nuclear weapons and it argued that many of the detailed provisions in START were no longer needed because the United States and Russia were no longer enemies.
These changes would have brought Russian forces below the 3,500 limit because so many of Russia's warheads are deployed on MIRVed ICBMs. As a result, many Russian officials and Duma members insisted that the United States and Russia negotiate a START III Treaty, with lower warhead numbers, so that Russia would not have to produce hundreds of new missiles to maintain START II levels.
The United States sought to address the Duma's concerns during 1997, by negotiating a Protocol that would extend the elimination deadlines in START II, and, therefore, reduce the annual costs of implementation, and by agreeing to negotiate a START III Treaty after START II entered into force.
The Clinton and Bush Years: Moving Past START and the ABM Treaty The arms control process between the United States and Russia essentially stalled during the 1990s, as efforts to ratify and implement START II dragged on.
The Department of Defense concluded that there was no military requirement for the deployment of such a system after intelligence estimates found that no additional nations (beyond China, Russia, France, and Great Britain) were likely to develop missiles that could threaten the continental United States for at least the next 10-15 years.
President Putin indicated that Russia wanted to use the formal arms control process, emphasizing that the two sides should focus on ""reaching a reliable and verifiable agreement."" Russia sought a ""legally binding document"" that would provide ""predictability and transparency"" and ensure for the ""irreversibilty of the reduction of nuclear forces."" The United States wanted to maintain the flexibility to size and structure its nuclear forces in response to its own needs.
The Bush Administration noted that the United States and Russia already collected information about strategic nuclear forces under START I and during implementation of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.
During hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Powell both agreed that the disposition of nonstrategic nuclear weapons should be on the agenda for future meetings between the United States and Russia, although neither supported a formal arms control regime to limit or contain these weapons.
Russia indicated that it might exercise its right to withdraw from the treaty if the United States increased the capabilities of its missile defenses ""in such a way that threatens the potential of the strategic nuclear forces of the Russian Federation.
Moreover, an increasing proportion of CTR funding has been allocated to projects outside the former Soviet Union, as the United States seeks to engage a greater number of nations as partners in the effort to secure vulnerable nuclear materials and other weapons of mass destruction.
CTR Program Areas The United States has provided Russia and the other former Soviet states with extensive assistance with projects designed to help with the elimination of nuclear, chemical, and other weapons and their delivery vehicles.
The State Department's Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) program helps the former Soviet states and other nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and their ability to stop the illicit trafficking of all materials for weapons of mass destruction, along with dual-use goods and technologies.
Treaty … On Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START), 2010: Obligates the United States and Russia to reduce strategic nuclear forces to 1,550 warheads on up to 700 deployed delivery vehicles, within a total of 800 deployed and nondeployed delivery vehicles."
194,"Table 1 reveals that most of the discrepancy between the trade data from the two nations stems from significantly different figures for China's exports to the United States.
Roughly half of the ""eastbound trade"" data discrepancy can be attributed to goods that ""leave China, enter the commerce of intermediate countries or regions, and then [are] re-exported to the United States.""  Implications for Congress The release of the official U.S. annual trade figures has been frequently followed by expressions of concern about the size of U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China."
195,"P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) ($4.0 billion was issued) to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses; $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs; numerous changes to the SBA's loan guaranty and contracting programs; funding to continue the fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010; and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses (see Table A-1 in the Appendix for a list of its key provisions).
The end result is that the agency helped put more than $42 billion in the hands of small businesses through the Recovery Act and Jobs Act combined."" During the 112 th Congress, several bills were introduced to enhance small business access to capital through the SBA, including bills to extend the SBA's temporary fee subsidies and increase the 7(a) program's loan guaranty percentage to 90%.
Recent Laws Designed to Enhance the Demand for Small Business Loans ARRA provided the SBA $375 million to subsidize fees for the SBA's 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs and to increase the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage from up to 85% of loans of $150,000 or less and up to 75% of loans exceeding $150,000 to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans through September 30, 2010, or when appropriated funding for the subsidies and loan modification was exhausted.
P.L. 111-150 , an act to extend the Small Business Loan Guarantee Program, and for other purposes, provided the SBA authority to reprogram $40 million in previously appropriated funds to continue the fee subsides and 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through April 30, 2010."
196,"However, the agency determined that 64,716 was the most appropriate maximum number of additional H-2B visas authorized under the special FY2017 provision, this being ""the number of beneficiaries covered by H–2B returning worker petitions that were approved for FY 2007.""  The supplementary information to the rule included the following explanation for limiting the FY2017 numerical increase to 15,000: Most recently, in FY 2016, 18,090 returning workers were approved for H–2B petitions, despite Congress having reauthorized the returning worker program with more than three-quarters of the fiscal year remaining.
Under the FY2019 rule, an employer may request supplemental visas only for H-2B workers ""who have been issued an H–2B visa or otherwise granted H–2B status in Fiscal Years 2016, 2017, or 2018."" DHS offers the following rationale for limiting the additional visas to H-2B returning workers: Such workers (i.e., those who recently participated in the H–2B program) have previously obtained H– 2B visas and therefore been vetted by DOS, would have departed the United States after their authorized period of stay as generally required by the terms of their nonimmigrant admission, and therefore may obtain their new visas through DOS and begin work more expeditiously."
197,"The Good Friday Agreement set out a framework for devolved government—the transfer of specified powers over local governance from London to Belfast—and called for establishing a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee in which unionist and nationalist parties would share power.
The harder-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), despite its continued opposition to many parts of the Good Friday Agreement, won 20 seats; Sinn Fein, the associated political party of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), won 18; and a number of smaller parties claimed the rest of the Assembly seats.
Following the suspension of Northern Ireland's devolved institutions in October 2002, Sinn Fein asserted that its acceptance of the PSNI and the Policing Board hinged on a deal to revive the devolved government and the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to a restored Assembly and Executive.
In late 2017, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar appeared to support this idea, but also noted that reviving the intergovernmental conference should not be construed as ""joint rule."" Initiatives to Further the Peace Process Over the past few years, the Northern Ireland political parties and the British and Irish governments have made several attempts to resolve outstanding issues related to the peace process, reduce tensions between the unionist and nationalist communities, and promote reconciliation.
(The specifics of the Haass proposals are discussed below in "" Ongoing Challenges ."") The Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Problems During the summer of 2014, the devolved government was tested by financial pressures and disagreement over UK-wide welfare reforms (passed by the UK parliament in February 2013 but which Sinn Fein and the SDLP opposed implementing in Northern Ireland).
As part of the resulting ""Stormont House Agreement,"" the five main political parties agreed to support welfare reform (with certain mitigating measures), balance the budget, address Northern Ireland's heavy economic reliance on the public sector, and reduce the number of Executive departments and Assembly members over the next few years to improve efficiency and cut costs.
Many Northern Ireland political leaders and human rights groups were dismayed that negotiators failed to reach final agreement on establishing new institutions to deal with the past, as called for in the Stormont House Agreement.
The December 2014 Stormont House Agreement essentially endorsed this idea and asserted that a new Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition would be set up, composed of 15 members (with 7 to be appointed by Northern Ireland's main political parties and 8 drawn from outside the government)."
198,"This report opens with an examination of the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program's legislative origin and provides a historical summary of the major issues that have influenced the program's development, including  the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with a Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB program) that initially provided SBA-approved sureties a lower guarantee rate (not to exceed 70%) than those participating in the Prior Approval Program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed bonds to small businesses without the SBA's prior approval; P.L. 114-92 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the PSB program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses; and the decision to increase the program's bond limit.
The SBA also was authorized to ""obligate the surety to pay the Administration such portions of the bond fee as the Administration determines to be reasonable in light of the relative risks and costs involved."" The program's sponsors argued in 1970 that ""there is widespread evidence that a significant number of construction contracting organizations find varying degrees of difficulty in obtaining surety bonds"" and that ""the major share of these organizations are small businesses, and many of them are headed by minority groups."" They argued that the Surety Bond Guarantee Program would ""facilitate the entry and advancement of small and minority contractors in the construction business."" At that time, witnesses at congressional hearings testified that surety bonds were not necessarily required for most private sector construction contracts, but they were required for most public sector construction contracts.
During the 111 th Congress, P.L. 111-5 provided the Revolving Fund a separate appropriation of $15 million to support a temporary increase in the program's bond limit to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certified in writing that a guarantee in excess of $5 million was necessary, from $2 million.
One possible contributing factor to the decline in SBA-guaranteed surety bonds during that period was the continuing reluctance of many surety companies to participate in the program, either because they did not view the program as particularly profitable or they ""had developed alternative methods to the program, such as requiring collateral or funds controls and underwriting programs based in part on credit scores, in order to write small and emerging contractors."" Another possible contributing factor was a change in the way the program was perceived by congressional leaders and their reluctance to provide additional resources to continue the program's expansion.
For example, in 1982, the chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business indicted that the program was subject to ""the most insidious types of fraud,"" including ""evidence of involvement of organized crime figures."" In addition, reports by both GAO and the SBA's inspector general questioned the SBA's management of the program, arguing, among other things, that the SBA lacked useful underwriting guidelines for surety companies and adequate procedures for verifying applicants' information."
199,"This report also provides total available funding (which includes carryover from the prior fiscal year, carryover into the next fiscal year, account transfers, rescissions, and sequestration) and, for comparative purposes, actual and anticipated expenditures for the SBA's entrepreneurial development noncredit programs.
SBA appropriations, as a whole, have varied significantly from year to year since FY2000 and across all three major SBA spending categories: appropriations for disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and ""other programs,"" a spending category that includes appropriations for salaries and expenses, business loan administration, the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Advocacy, and entrepreneurial development noncredit programs.
As mentioned previously, prior to FY2012, the SBA reported Advocacy's total program cost, which includes funding provided through the salaries and expenses' executive direction subaccount, agency-wide overhead costs (rent, telecommunications, etc.), and other support costs (e.g., management and administrative support, including human resources support)."
200,"In addition, new payment methods (e.g., PayPal's Venmo app and Square's point-of-sale hardware, among others) use underlying traditional banking and payments systems to make electronic payments less expensive and more available to individuals and small businesses.
Proponents of reducing the use of physical currency (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society ) argue that it will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy.
In traditional noncash payment systems like those that are prevalent today, participants hold their money in an account at a bank or other financial intermediary that maintains accurate ledgers of how much money each customer has available.
As discussed in an earlier section, traditional electronic payment systems involve a number of intermediaries, such as government central banks and private financial institutions.
In addition, opening a bank account or otherwise using traditional electronic payment systems generally requires an individual to divulge to a financial institution certain basic personal information, such as name, Social Security number, and birthdate.
Proponents of CBDCs generally argue they could provide efficiency gains over traditional legacy systems and contend that central banks could use the technologies underlying digital currencies to deploy a faster, less costly government-supported payment system.
Privacy Concerns Opening a bank account or otherwise using traditional noncash payment systems generally requires an individual to divulge certain basic personal information, such as name, Social Security number, and birthdate, to a financial institution."
201,"Responding to concerns from some groups that WIFIA could impair and diminish support for clean water and drinking water SRF programs under the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act (see discussion below), the act requires the EPA Administrator, when the agency receives applications for WIFIA assistance, to notify state infrastructure financing authorities and give them the opportunity to commit funds to the project.
Projects must also comply with the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act in the same manner that they would under the SRF provisions of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the act directed EPA and the Corps to provide information on a website concerning applications and projects that have received assistance, and the Government Accountability Office must report to Congress (four years after enactment, i.e., June 10, 2018) on the program and provide recommendations for continuing, changing, or terminating the WIFIA program.
CBO cited the JCT estimate that enactment of the bill would reduce revenues by $135 million over 10 years, because states would be expected to issue tax-exempt bonds for water projects in order to acquire additional funds not covered by WIFIA assistance."
202,"The provisions contain three separate waivers—a general waiver, a cellulosic biofuel waiver, and a biomass-based diesel waiver—that the EPA Administrator may use to waive, in whole or in part, the volume of renewable fuel mandated by statute."
203,"The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, FL, is a functional combatant command responsible for training, doctrine, and equipping for all U.S. SOF units.
Army Special Operations Command U.S. Army SOF (ARSOF) includes approximately 33,000 soldiers from the active Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve organized into Special Forces, Ranger, and special operations aviation units, along with civil affairs units, military information units, and special operations support units."
204,"It includes general information concerning Africa's economic and development challenges, governance and human rights trends on the continent, and key issues related to peace and security.
This report is intended to serve as a primer to help inform deliberations on key enduring issues for Congress, which include the authorization and appropriation of funding for U.S. foreign aid programs and U.S. military activities in the region and oversight of U.S. programs and policies.
He identified three core U.S. interests in Africa: expanding U.S. trade and commercial ties with African countries, ""countering the threat from Radical Islamic Terrorism and violent conflict,"" and imposing more stringent conditions on U.S. aid and U.N. peacekeeping missions in the region.
Bolton indicated that the Administration would prioritize efforts to counter ""Great power competitors, namely China and Russia, [which] are rapidly expanding their financial and political influence across Africa."" The new policy framework appears to respond to criticism from some observers suggesting that the United States seems less engaged on the continent than in previous years, at a time when other foreign actors, including China and Russia, are seeking to expand their roles.
An accompanying White House fact sheet echoed such aims while emphasizing, among other ends, the Administration's intention to promote the use of nonreciprocal U.S. trade preferences provided under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA, discussed below), respond to deadly infectious diseases, advance democracy in the region, ""strengthen states where failure to do so would threaten our homeland,"" and take unilateral action when doing so is in the interest of U.S. national security.
In addition to the Administration's proposals to reduce overall aid to Africa (discussed below), National Security Advisor Bolton suggested in his December 2018 remarks that the Administration would curtail aid to countries whose governments are ""corrupt,"" or ""repeatedly vote against the United States in international forums, or take action counter to U.S. interests."" He also noted that the Administration would direct U.S. assistance to governments that pursue democratic, accountable, and transparent governance, as well as fiscal transparency, the rule of law, and growth-centered economic reforms.
Such comments align with the Administration's National Security Strategy, which portrays Chinese influence as undermining African development ""by corrupting elites, dominating extractive industries, and locking countries into unsustainable and opaque debts and commitments."" Executive branch policy documents and statements also cite rising ""great power competition"" globally, including in Africa."

The directive, among other things, states that the United States is an Arctic nation, with varied and compelling interests in the region; sets forth a six-element overall U.S. policy for the region; describes U.S. national security and homeland security interests in the Arctic; and discusses a number of issues as they relate to the Arctic, including international governance; the extended continental shelf and boundary issues; promotion of international scientific cooperation; maritime transportation; economic issues, including energy; and environmental protection and conservation of natural resources.
May 2010 National Security Strategy In May 2010, the Obama Administration released a national security strategy document that states the following: The United States is an Arctic Nation with broad and fundamental interests in the Arctic region, where we seek to meet our national security needs, protect the environment, responsibly manage resources, account for indigenous communities, support scientific research, and strengthen international cooperation on a wide range of issues.
This strategy is intended to position the United States to respond effectively to challenges and emerging opportunities arising from significant increases in Arctic activity due to the diminishment of sea ice and the emergence of a new Arctic environment.
It defines U.S. national security interests in the Arctic region and identifies prioritized lines of effort, building upon existing initiatives by Federal, state, local, and tribal authorities, the private sector, and international partners, and aims to focus efforts where opportunities exist and action is needed.
Advance United States Security Interests – We will enable our vessels and aircraft to operate, consistent with international law, through, under, and over the airspace and waters of the Arctic, support lawful commerce, achieve a greater awareness of activity in the region, and intelligently evolve our Arctic infrastructure and capabilities, including ice-capable platforms as needed.
3. Strengthen International Cooperation – Working through bilateral relationships and multilateral bodies, including the Arctic Council, we will pursue arrangements that advance collective interests, promote shared Arctic state prosperity, protect the Arctic environment, and enhance regional security, and we will work toward U.S. accession to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Law of the Sea Convention).
The lines of effort of the Strategy and the Implementation Plan are as follows: • Advance United States Security Interests • Pursue Responsible Arctic Region Stewardship • Strengthen International Cooperation These lines of effort and guiding principles are meant to be implemented as a coherent whole.
Federal agencies, the State of Alaska, tribal communities, local governments, and academia will work with other nations, industry stakeholders, non-governmental organizations, and research partners to address emerging challenges and opportunities in the Arctic environment.
The Steering Committee, in coordination with the heads of relevant agencies and under the direction of the Chair, shall: (a) provide guidance and coordinate efforts to implement the priorities, objectives, activities, and responsibilities identified in National Security Presidential Directive 66/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 25, Arctic Region Policy, the National Strategy for the Arctic Region and its Implementation Plan, and related agency plans; (b) provide guidance on prioritizing Federal activities, consistent with agency authorities, while the United States is Chair of the Arctic Council, including, where appropriate, recommendations for resources to use in carrying out those activities; and (c) establish a working group to provide a report to the Steering Committee by May 1, 2015, that: (i) identifies potential areas of overlap between and within agencies with respect to implementation of Arctic policy and strategic priorities and provides recommendations to increase coordination and reduce any duplication of effort, which may include ways to increase the effectiveness of existing groups; and (ii) provides recommendations to address any potential gaps in implementation....
This process shall ensure meaningful consultation and collaboration with Alaska Native tribal governments and similar Alaska Native organizations in the development of Federal policies that have Alaska Native implications, as applicable, and provide feedback and recommendations to the Steering Committee; (c) identify an appropriate Federal entity to be the point of contact for Arctic matters with the State of Alaska and with Alaska Native tribal governments and similar Alaska Native organizations to support collaboration and communication; and (d) invite members of State, local, and Alaska Native tribal governments and similar Alaska Native organizations, and academic and research institutions to consult on issues or participate in discussions, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.
As stated in the above-quoted passage, Executive Order 13689, among other things, established an Arctic Executive Steering Committee (AESC) to ""provide guidance to executive departments and agencies (agencies) and enhance coordination of Federal Arctic policies across agencies and offices, and, where applicable, with State, local, and Alaska Native tribal governments and similar Alaska Native organizations, academic and research institutions, and the private and nonprofit sectors."" Regarding the AESC, a February 28, 2019, press report states the following: ""Although the [executive] order has not been rescinded, the Trump administration has left the committee dormant for the past two years."" U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic (Currently Vacant) On July 16, 2014, during the Obama Administration, then-Secretary of State John Kerry announced the appointment of retired Coast Guard Admiral Robert J.
The council is ""the leading intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States, Arctic indigenous communities and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular on issues of sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic."" Specific issues addressed by the council include regional development, the environment, emergency response, climate change, and natural resource extraction.
The Obama Administration's January 2014 implementation plan for its national strategy for the Arctic region (see discussion above) includes, as one of its 36 or so initiatives, one entitled ""Accede to the Law of the Sea Convention."" Under this initiative, the State Department and other federal agencies are to ""continue to seek the Senate's advice and consent to accede to the Law of the Sea Convention."" The document states that ""the [Obama] Administration is committed, like the last three Administrations, to pursuing accession to the Convention on the Law of the Sea and will continue to place a priority on attaining Senate advice and consent to accession."" Senate Arctic Caucus On March 4 and 5, 2015, Senator Lisa Murkowski and Senator Angus King announced the formation of a Senate Arctic Caucus ""to spotlight this region and open up a wider conversation about the nation's future in the region as America prepares to accede to the Chair of the Arctic Council."" Issues for Congress Climate Change and Loss of Arctic Sea Ice64 Record low extents of Arctic sea ice in 2012 and 2007 have focused scientific and policy attention on climate changes in the high north, and on the implications of projected ice-free seasons in the Arctic within decades.
(For further discussion, see "" Extent of the Continental Margin "" in "" Oil, Gas, and Mineral Exploration ."") Territorial Disputes and Sovereignty Issues In addition to this process, there are four unresolved Arctic territorial disputes: Scientists have forecast that in coming decades, global warming will reduce the ice pack in Canada's northern archipelago sufficiently to permit ships to use the trans-Arctic shipping route known as the Northwest Passage during the summer months (see "" Commercial Sea Transportation "").
The declaration includes the following interim measures: to authorize our vessels to conduct commercial fishing in the high seas area only pursuant to one or more marine regional or subregional fisheries management organizations or arrangements that are or may be established to manage such fishing in accordance with recognized international standards; to establish a joint program of scientific research with the aim of improving understanding of the ecosystems of this area and promote cooperation with relevant scientific bodies; to promote compliance with these interim measures and with relevant international law, including by coordinating our monitoring, control, and surveillance activities in this area; and to ensure that any noncommercial fishing in this area does not undermine the purpose of the interim measures, is based on scientific advice and is monitored, and that data obtained through any such fishing is shared.
In April 2009, the Inuit Circumpolar Council (an organization of Inuit in the Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia) hosted in Alaska the worldwide ""Indigenous Peoples Global Summit on Climate Change."" The conference report, forwarded to the Copenhagen Conference of the Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (December 2009), noted ""accelerating"" climate change caused by ""unsustainable development"" and, among several recommendations, called for a greater indigenous role in national and international decisions on climate change, including a greater role for indigenous knowledge in climate change research, monitoring, and mitigation.
The roles of U.S. polar icebreakers can be summarized as follows: conducting and supporting scientific research in the Arctic and Antarctic; defending U.S. sovereignty in the Arctic by helping to maintain a U.S. presence in U.S. territorial waters in the region; defending other U.S. interests in polar regions, including economic interests in waters that are within the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) north of Alaska; monitoring sea traffic in the Arctic, including ships bound for the United States; and conducting other typical Coast Guard missions (such as search and rescue, law enforcement, and protection of marine resources) in Arctic waters, including U.S. territorial waters north of Alaska.
2017 Arctic SAR Capabilities Survey A 2017 survey of Arctic SAR capabilities conducted as part of the Finnish Border Guard's Arctic Maritime Safety Cooperation project in cooperation with the Arctic Coast Guard Forum stated the following: The key challenges for Arctic search and rescue identified in this survey include long distances, severe weather, ice and cold conditions, a poor communications network, lack of infrastructure and lack of resource presence in the region.
The committee notes that the Department of Defense's Report to Congress on Strategy to Protect United States National Security Interests in the Arctic Region, a report required in section 1068 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public-Law 114–92), identified the need for additional personnel recovery capability in this region.
In considering this question, geographic points that can be noted include the following: Russia, according to one assessment, ""has at least half of the Arctic in terms of area, coastline, population and probably mineral wealth."" Russia has numerous cities and towns in its Arctic, uses its coastal Arctic waters as a maritime highway for supporting its Arctic communities, is promoting the Northern Sea Route that runs along Russia's Arctic coast for use by others, and is keen to capitalize on natural resource development in the region, both onshore and offshore.
On the other hand, as discussed later in this report, a significant increase in Russian military capabilities and operations in the Arctic in recent years has prompted growing concerns among U.S., Canadian, and Nordic observers that the Arctic might once again become a region of military tension and competition, as well as concerns about whether the United States, Canada, and the Nordic countries are adequately prepared militarily to defend their interests in the region.
In that effort, DoD must work with the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security to address gaps in Arctic communications, domain awareness, search and rescue, and environmental observation and forecasting capabilities to support both current and future planning and operations.
Increased sea levels and storm surges threaten coastal regions, infrastructure, and property."" It also states that ""we seek to build on the unprecedented international cooperation of the last few years, especially in the Arctic as well as in combatting piracy off the Horn of Africa and drug-smuggling in the Caribbean Sea and across Southeast Asia,"" and that ""we will also stay engaged with global suppliers and our partners to reduce the potential for energy-related conflict in places like the Arctic and Asia."" June 2015 GAO Report A June 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report states the following: Recent strategic guidance on the Arctic issued by the [Obama] administration and the Department of Defense (DOD) establish a supporting role for the department relative to other federal agencies, based on a low level of military threat expected in the region.
June 2016 DOD Report on Funding for 2013 Arctic Strategy A June 2016 DOD report to Congress on resourcing the Arctic Strategy states that DOD is making investments in research, military infrastructure, and capabilities to execute the 2013 Arctic Strategy and support the development of the Arctic as a secure and stable region where U.S. national interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is protected, and nations work cooperatively to address challenges.
These include --Enhance the capability of U.S. forces to defend the homeland and exercise sovereignty; --Strengthen deterrence at home and abroad; --Strengthen alliances and partnerships; --Preserve freedom of the seas in the Arctic; --Engage public, private, and international partners to improve domain awareness in the Arctic; --Evolve DoD Arctic infrastructure and capabilities consistent with changing conditions and needs; --Provide support to civil authorities, as directed; --Partner with other departments, agencies, and nations to support human and environmental security; and --Support international institutions that promote regional cooperation and the rule of law.
(a) The Congress finds and declares that- (1) the Arctic, onshore and offshore, contains vital energy resources that can reduce the Nation's dependence on foreign oil and improve the national balance of payments; (2) as the Nation's only common border with the Soviet Union, the Arctic is critical to national defense; (3) the renewable resources of the Arctic, specifically fish and other seafood, represent one of the Nation's greatest commercial assets; (4) Arctic conditions directly affect global weather patterns and must be understood in order to promote better agricultural management throughout the United States; (5) industrial pollution not originating in the Arctic region collects in the polar air mass, has the potential to disrupt global weather patterns, and must be controlled through international cooperation and consultation; (6) the Arctic is a natural laboratory for research into human health and adaptation, physical and psychological, to climates of extreme cold and isolation and may provide information crucial for future defense needs; (7) atmospheric conditions peculiar to the Arctic make the Arctic a unique testing ground for research into high latitude communications, which is likely to be crucial for future defense needs; (8) Arctic marine technology is critical to cost-effective recovery and transportation of energy resources and to the national defense; (9) the United States has important security, economic, and environmental interests in developing and maintaining a fleet of icebreaking vessels capable of operating effectively in the heavy ice regions of the Arctic; (10) most Arctic-rim countries, particularly the Soviet Union, possess Arctic technologies far more advanced than those currently available in the United States; (11) Federal Arctic research is fragmented and uncoordinated at the present time, leading to the neglect of certain areas of research and to unnecessary duplication of effort in other areas of research; (12) improved logistical coordination and support for Arctic research and better dissemination of research data and information is necessary to increase the efficiency and utility of national Arctic research efforts; (13) a comprehensive national policy and program plan to organize and fund currently neglected scientific research with respect to the Arctic is necessary to fulfill national objectives in Arctic research; (14) the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local governments, should focus its efforts on the collection and characterization of basic data related to biological, materials, geophysical, social, and behavioral phenomena in the Arctic; (15) research into the long-range health, environmental, and social effects of development in the Arctic is necessary to mitigate the adverse consequences of that development to the land and its residents; (16) Arctic research expands knowledge of the Arctic, which can enhance the lives of Arctic residents, increase opportunities for international cooperation among Arctic-rim countries, and facilitate the formulation of national policy for the Arctic; and (17) the Alaskan Arctic provides an essential habitat for marine mammals, migratory waterfowl, and other forms of wildlife which are important to the Nation and which are essential to Arctic residents.
4. United States platforms capable of supporting forefront research in the Arctic Ocean, including portions expected to be ice-covered for the foreseeable future, as well as seasonally ice-free regions, should work with those of other nations through the establishment of an Arctic circumpolar observing network.
2. Safe, secure, and environmentally sound maritime commerce in the Arctic region depends on infrastructure to support shipping activity, search and rescue capabilities, short- and long-range aids to navigation, high-risk area vessel-traffic management, iceberg warnings and other sea ice information, effective shipping standards, and measures to protect the marine environment.
3. Working through the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United States promotes strengthening existing measures and, as necessary, developing new measures to improve the safety and security of maritime transportation, as well as to protect the marine environment in the Arctic region.
To accomplish this line of effort, the United States Government will seek to: • Evolve Arctic Infrastructure and Strategic Capabilities – Working cooperatively with the State of Alaska, local, and tribal authorities, as well as public and private sector partners, we will develop, maintain, and exercise the capacity to execute Federal responsibilities in our Arctic waters, airspace, and coastal regions, including the capacity to respond to natural or man-made disasters.
The United States will endeavor to appropriately enhance sea, air, and space capabilities as Arctic conditions change, and to promote maritime-related information sharing with international, public, and private sector partners, to support implementation of activities such as the search-and-rescue agreement signed by Arctic states."
209,"Navy IW Operations Elsewhere In addition to participating in U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan, Navy IW operations in the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2011, have also included the following: security force assistance operations , in which forward-deployed Navy ships have exercised and worked with foreign navies, coast guards, and maritime police forces, so as to improve their abilities to conduct maritime security operations; civic assistance operations , in which forward-deployed Navy units, including Navy hospital ships, expeditionary medical teams, fleet surgical teams, and naval construction units have provided medical and construction services in foreign countries as a complement to other U.S. diplomatic and development activities in those countries; disaster relief operations , of which Navy forces have performed several in recent years; and counter-piracy operations , particularly off the Horn of Africa.
Navy Counterterrorism (CT) Operations In General Navy CT operations (and anti-terrorism/force protection activities) at various points since the late 1990s, and particularly in the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have included the following: Operations by Navy special operations forces, known as SEALs (an acronym standing for Sea, Air, and Land), that have been directed against terrorists; Tomahawk cruise missile attacks on suspected terrorist training camps and facilities, such as those reportedly conducted in Somalia on March 3 and May 1, 2008, and those conducted in 1998 in response to the 1998 terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa; surveillance by Navy ships and aircraft of suspected terrorists overseas; maritime intercept operations (MIO) that were aimed at identifying and intercepting terrorists or weapons of mass destruction at sea, or potentially threatening ships or aircraft that are in or approaching U.S. territorial waters—an activity that has included Navy participation in the multilateral Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI); protection of forward-deployed Navy ships, an activity that was intensified following the terrorist attack on the Navy Aegis destroyer Cole (DDG-67) in October 2000 in the port of Aden, Yemen; protection of domestic and overseas Navy bases and facilities; working with the Coast Guard to build maritime domain awareness (or MDA, meaning a real-time understanding of activities on the world's oceans), and engaging with the U.S. Coast Guard to use the National Strategy for Maritime Security to more rapidly develop capabilities for Homeland Security, particularly in the area of MDA; assisting the Coast Guard in port-security operations; developing Global Maritime Intelligence Integration (GMII) as part of Joint Force Maritime Component Command (JFMCC) and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA); and operations by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), for which combating terrorism is a core mission area.
Press reports in July 2010 stated that U.S. forces in Afghanistan included at that time a special unit called Task Force 373, composed of Navy SEALs and Army Delta Force personnel, whose mission is ""the deactivation of top Taliban and terrorists by either killing or capturing them.""  A July 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report and a separate CRS report provide additional background information on the SEALs. Another CRS report provides further discussion of the operation that killed Osama bin Laden.
Navy Irregular Warfare Office (NIWO)/Navy Warfare Group (NWG) The Navy in July 2008 established the Navy Irregular Warfare Office (NIWO) so as to ""institutionalize current ad hoc efforts in IW missions of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency and the supporting missions of information operations, intelligence operations, foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare as they apply to [CT] and [counterinsurgency]."" In January 2013, the Navy directed the establishment of a Navy Warfare Group (NWG) ""to provide a dedicated organization to systematically evaluate, develop, and implement new strategic concepts deemed useful to the service...."" NIWO was disbanded, and its responsibilities were transferred to NWG, which is to ""[s]erve as the Navy lead for irregular warfare (IW) to incorporate IW into Navy capstone documents and to inform the PPBE [Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution] process."" 2010 Navy Vision Statement for Countering Irregular Challenges The Navy in January 2010 published a vision statement for countering irregular challenges, which stated the following in part: The U.S. Navy will meet irregular challenges through a flexible, agile, and broad array of multi-mission capabilities.
The Navy Reserve trains and equips over half of the Sailors supporting NECC missions, including naval construction and explosive ordnance disposal in the CENTCOM region, as well as maritime expeditionary security, expeditionary logistics (cargo handling battalions), maritime civil affairs, expeditionary intelligence, and other mission capabilities seamlessly integrated with operational forces around the world.
DON stated in 2014 that ""through partnerships with a growing number of nations, including those in Africa and Latin America, we will strive for a common vision of freedom, stability, and prosperity."" Partnership Stations The Southern Partnership Station (SPS) and the Africa Partnership Station (APS) were Navy ships, such as amphibious ships or high-speed sealift ships, that deployed to the Caribbean and to waters off Africa, respectively, to support U.S. Navy engagement with countries in those regions, particularly for purposes of building security partnerships with those countries, and for increasing the capabilities of those countries for performing maritime-security operations.
The Navy stated that CORIVFOR ""performs core maritime expeditionary security missions in the green and brown waters, bridging the gap between traditional Navy blue water operations and land-based forces, providing port and harbor security for vital waterways and protection of high value assets and maritime infrastructure."" The Navy stated that CORIVFOR was scheduled to reach initial operating capability (IOC) in October 2012 and full operational capability (FOC) in October 2014, and that ""all current and scheduled routine deployments will continue as normal."" A July 14, 2014, news report states the following: In 2012, the Navy merged Riverine Forces and Maritime Expeditionary Security Forces to form the Coastal Riverine Force.
FY2020 Funding Request Overview DON states that the proposed FY2020 budget ""continues funding to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and for operations in Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and other locations in theater, as well as for the European Deterrence Initiative,"" and ""supports building a more experienced, better trained, and more capable force by increasing the number of Marines with special skills, like those required for special operations, intelligence operations, electronic, information, and cyber warfare."" Special Operations Command's (SOCOM's) proposed FY2020 budget requests, among other things, $72.6 million in the FY2020 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Defense-Wide (RDT&EDW) account for Program Element (PE) 1160483BB, maritime systems (line 263 in the FY2020 RDT&EDW account), including $45.2 million for Project S0417: Underwater Systems, and $27.4 million for S1684: Surface Craft; and $59.0 million in the FY2020 Procurement, Defense-Wide (PDW) appropriation account for procurement of underwater systems for SOCOM (line 63 in the FY2020 PDW account).
In that connection, the following points were provided to CRS by the Joint Staff J-7 Irregular Warfare office in August 2016: ""US Navy IW funding and force structure have declined over the last few years."" ""NIWO's responsibilities now belong to OPNAV N515 [i.e., the office within the Chief of Naval Operations that oversees the NWG], with dedicated IW staff decreasing from 13 government/military personnel along with 6 contractors led by a RDML [rear admiral] to 2 contractors and one O-5 [an officer that in the Navy is a commander] under O-6 [an officer that in the Navy is a captain] oversight."" In May 2014, the Navy closed its Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command (MCAST), an action ""which reduced civil affairs (CA) and security force assistance (SFA) capacity.
The training, in a location relatively near to and similar in climate to the South China Sea, where China continues to assert its dominance, is necessary to enhance the Navy Special Warfare Command's traditional skill sets, including diving and swimming; operating with submersibles and unmanned aircraft systems; insertion and extraction; reconnaissance and parachuting; and rope suspension training activities, according to the report.
NSW RESOURCING After nearly 17 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are focused on reasserting our capabilities as the maritime component to Special Operations, properly postured to meet the threats of the future, enhancing our partnership with the Navy and exploring opportunities for increased integration and interoperability, while building capabilities and capacity with fleet, submarine, aviation and cyber forces.
The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.

211,"The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-224 ) authorized new federal spending for the program primarily through more generous premium subsidies to help make the program more affordable to farmers and enhance farmer participation levels in an effort to preclude the need for ad hoc emergency disaster payments.
Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) LFP makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses on drought-affected pastureland (including cropland planted specifically for grazing), or on rangeland managed by a federal agency due to a qualifying fire.
In addition to the programmatic changes discussed in the "" Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance Programs "" section of this report, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also authorized $2.36 billion for production losses not covered under NAP or crop insurance."
212,"However, considerable uncertainty remains concerning whether the United States will achieve a resolution to its trade dispute with China and other major trading partners, what crops U.S. producers will decide to plant across the major growing regions of the United States ( Figure 3 ), whether farmers and ranchers will continue to expand livestock production ( Figure 8 ), what weather and growing conditions will prevail during the principal plant-growth season, and how domestic and international demand will evolve during the year.
U.S. Agriculture Outlook: 2019 Overview Farm production choices in 2019 will largely be determined by producers' expectations for relative net returns from both the market and government programs across the various crops and livestock activities.
Despite the near-record production, USDA predicts that record large domestic usage (including for livestock feed, ethanol production, other industrial processing, and seed) plus large exports will result in a small reduction in corn ending stocks, a decline in the ending stocks-to-use ratio to 14.0% (down from 14.5%) and a slightly higher season average farm price of $3.55/bushel."
213,"A former rule of the House (known as the ''Gephardt rule'' after Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri) provided for a measure to amend the debt to automatically be engrossed and deemed to have been passed by the House by the same vote as the adoption by the House of a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget setting forth a level of the public debt different from the existing statutory limit, thereby avoiding the need for a separate vote on the debt limit."
214,"The county poverty rates for 1999 and previous years are measured using decennial census data, and for more recent years, either the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) or the American Community Survey (ACS).
Currently, the only data sources that provide poverty estimates for all U.S. counties are the American Community Survey (ACS) and the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program (SAIPE)."
215,"The United States imports for several reasons: some goods cannot be produced domestically in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand or would be costly to produce relative to other economic activities; other products and services are imported because they can be produced less expensively or more efficiently by foreign firms.
Economists continue to examine to what extent comparative advantage explains the increasingly complex trade patterns in the 21 st century with the rise of global value chains—where different stages of production of a single good take place in several countries—and with the rise of services and digital trade, and cross-border flows of data and technology.
More direct influence can include policies (such as subsidies or tariffs) that promote and protect certain industries considered to have significant strategic and economic potential but that require initial government support to help a country reach its economic targets.
Some economists contend that protectionist policies that arise through direct policy interventions can potentially distort a country's trade and investment flows, reduce economic efficiency, or undermine the development of competitive industries that do not receive support.
In one study, the OECD concluded that ""in advanced economies, at least 10% of the decline of the labour share [in total national income] is accounted for by increasing globalisation—and in particular by the pressures from the delocalisation of some parts of the production chain as well as from import competition from firms producing in countries with low labour cost."" A range of studies suggests that within the United States, globalization has contributed marginally to rising U.S. wage inequality at a factor ranging from 10% to 20%.
Amid several downside risks, including rising trade tensions between major economies like the United States and China, and heightened trade policy uncertainty, the IMF and WTO now expect global trade growth to slow.
The broadest measure of a country's trade balance is the current account, which includes trade in goods, services, net income (payments and receipts on foreign investments), and some official, or government, flows.
In 2017, the United States exported $1.3 trillion in manufactured goods and imported $2.0 trillion, creating a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion (see Figure 9 ).
Historically, U.S. trade policy has focused on supporting economic growth and jobs through trade, liberalizing markets by reducing trade and investment barriers through trade agreements and negotiations, enforcing trade commitments and related laws, and providing time-limited relief to companies and workers facing unfair or injurious import competition.
Cases may involve, for example, customs classification decisions, agency determinations in antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) proceedings, Section 201 safeguards, Section 232 national security investigations (see "" Tariffs and Trade Remedies ""), or the constitutionality of state economic sanctions.
The United States negotiates trade liberalizing agreements for economic and commercial reasons, as well as foreign policy and national security reasons.
Objectives include:  encourage trade partners to reduce or eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers and increase market access for U.S. exporters; gain competitive advantages for U.S. firms over foreign competitors in third country markets; increase access to lower-cost imports that offer domestic and industrial consumers a wider choice of products; encourage trading partners, especially developing countries, to liberalize their trade and investment regimes, and thereby improve the efficiency of their economies and their integration with the global economy; and strengthen alliances, forge new strategic relationships, and deepen U.S. presence and influence in a geographic region.
Nearly all U.S. FTAs include not only the elimination of the majority of tariffs on trade in goods, but also reduction of barriers to services trade, rules on foreign investment, intellectual property rights protection, commitments on opening government procurement markets, and enforceable provisions on labor standards and the environment.
The WTO is a 164-member international organization that administers the trade rules and agreements negotiated by its members, including the United States, to eliminate barriers and create nondiscriminatory rules to govern trade.
The U.S. government has viewed TCB as an important way to help developing countries ""negotiate and implement market opening and reform-oriented trade agreements and improve their capacity to benefit from increased trade."" Examples include U.S. assistance to implement customs reforms required by the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, improve labor and environment protections, and meet export standards and phyto-sanitary rules."
216,"Recent Developments On January 2, 2019, for the second year in a row, the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN) reported a significant decline in the annual number of short-term detentions for political reasons.
(See discussion on constitutional changes in "" Cuba's Transition to a New President ,"" below.) On December 20, 2018, President Trump signed into law the 2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334 ( H.R. 2 ), with a provision that permits funding for two export promotion programs—the Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Cooperation Program—for U.S. agricultural products in Cuba.
(See "" Human Rights ,"" below.) On October 6, 2018, President Trump signed into law the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-254 ) with a provision requiring the Transportation Security Administration to brief Congress on certain aspects of Cuban airport security, develop and implement a mechanism to better track public air charter flights between the United States and Cuba, and direct public air charters to provide updated data on such flights.
It is divided into three major sections analyzing Cuba's political and economic environment; U.S. policy toward Cuba; and selected issues in U.S.-Cuban relations, including restrictions on travel and trade, funding for democracy and human rights projects in Cuba and for U.S. government-sponsored radio and television broadcasting, migration, antidrug cooperation, U.S. property claims, and U.S. fugitives from justice in Cuba.
The video shows him speaking at a closed Communist Party meeting earlier in the year in which he strongly criticized dissidents and independent voices (including those arguing for reform of the socialist system), criticized the expansion of Cuba's private sector, and characterized U.S. efforts toward normalization under President Obama as an attempt to destroy the Cuban revolution.
These organizations include the Ladies in White ( Las Damas de Blanco ), currently led by Berta Soler, formed in 2003 by the female relatives of the ""group of 75"" dissidents arrested that year, and the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), led by José Daniel Ferrer García, established in 2011 by several dissident groups with the goal of fighting peacefully for civil liberties and human rights; in August 2018, the Cuban government imprisoned Ferrer arbitrarily for 11 days with no access to his family, according to Amnesty International.
In 2008, Cuba lifted a ban on Cubans staying in hotels that previously had been restricted to foreign tourists in a policy that had been pejoratively referred to as ""tourist apartheid."" In recent years, as the government has enacted limited economic reforms, it has been much more open to debate on economic issues.
On October 16, 2018, the State Department's U.S. Mission to the United Nations launched a campaign to call attention to the plight of Cuba's ""estimated 130 political prisoners."" Cuban diplomats attempted to disrupt the event by making noise and shouting, although their actions appeared to call more attention to the event and, for some observers, demonstrated the Cuban government's disdain for freedom of expression.
The CACR, which include a prohibition on most financial transactions with Cuba and a freeze of Cuban government assets in the United States, remain the main body of Cuba embargo regulations and have been amended many times over the years to reflect changes in policy.
In addition to these acts, Congress enacted numerous other provisions of law over the years that impose sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on trade, foreign aid, and support from international financial institutions.
The President said that ""the United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba."" While recognizing that it would take time to ""overcome decades of mistrust,"" the President said ""there are critical steps we can take toward a new day."" He stated that he was prepared to have his Administration ""engage with the Cuban government on a wide range of issues—from drugs, migration, and economic issues, to human rights, free speech, and democratic reform."" In 2011, the Obama Administration introduced new measures to further reach out to the Cuban people through increased purposeful travel (including people-to-people educational travel) and an easing of restrictions on nonfamily remittances.
The President said that his Administration would ""end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests."" He maintained that the United States would continue to raise concerns about democracy and human rights in Cuba but stated that ""we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement."" President Obama outlined three major steps to move toward normalization: (1) a review of Cuba's designation by the Department of State as a state sponsor of international terrorism; (2) the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba; and (3) an increase in travel, commerce, and the flow of information to and from Cuba.
In May 2017, then-Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Francisco Palmieri emphasized that ""one of the areas that is going to be a high priority is ensuring that Cuba makes more substantive progress toward a greater respect for human rights inside the country."" On May 20, 2017, President Trump issued a statement to the Cuban American community and the people of Cuba in celebrating the anniversary of Cuban independence.
In the strongly worded statement, President Trump said, ""The Cuban people deserve a government that peacefully upholds democratic values, economic liberties, religious freedoms, and human rights, and my Administration is committed to achieving that vision."" Cuba's state television published an ""official note"" describing the statement as ""controversial and ridiculous."" Partial Rollback of Engagement and Increased Sanctions President Trump unveiled his Administration's policy on Cuba on June 16, 2017, which partially rolls back some of the Obama Administration's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba.
The new policy also keeps in place the Obama Administration's action ending the so-called wet foot/dry foot policy toward Cuban migrants, which, according to the NSPM, had ""encouraged untold thousands of Cuban nationals to risk their lives to travel unlawfully to the United States."" The most significant policy changes set forth in President Trump's NSPM included (1) restrictions on financial transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel and (2) the elimination of individual people-to-people travel.
In October 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained for the first time on the resolution, but U.S. officials also took the opportunity to express profound concerns about the Cuban government's Cuba's poor human rights record.
According to the State Department, ""the embassy will continue to operate with the minimum personnel necessary to perform core diplomatic and consular functions, similar to the level of emergency staffing maintained during ordered departure."" Although responsibility for injuries to U.S. personnel in Cuba is unknown, speculation by some observers has focused on such possibilities as a rogue faction of Cuba's security services or a third country, such as Russia, with the apparent motivation of wanting to disrupt U.S.-Cuban relations.
Major arguments in opposition to lifting the Cuba travel ban are that more American travel would support the Cuban government with potentially millions of dollars in hard currency; that legal provisions allowing travel to Cuba for humanitarian purposes exist and are used by thousands of Americans each year; and that the President should be free to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons.
In October 2018, Congress completed action on the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, signed into law as P.L. 115-254 ( H.R. 302 ), which includes a provision in Section 1957 (similar, although not identical, to a provision in H.R. 3328 noted above) requiring the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to provide Congress a briefing on certain aspects of security measures at airports in Cuba that have air service to the United States.
Note: The Trump Administration's policy changes on Cuba, as set forth by amended Commerce Department regulations issued in November 2017, stipulate that export licenses for exports to state-owned enterprises will generally be denied to export items for use by entities or subentities on the State Department's list of restricted entities associated with the Cuban military, police, intelligence, or security services.
A provision in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure (§211 of Division A, Title II, P.L. 105-277 , signed into law October 21, 1998) prevents the United States from accepting payment from Cuban nationals for trademark registrations and renewals that were used in connection with a business or assets in Cuba that were confiscated, unless the original owner of the trademark has consented.
The programs would ""provide humanitarian assistance to victims of political repression and their families, strengthen independent civil society, support the Cuban people's desire to freely determine their future, reduce their dependence on the Cuban state, and promote the flow of uncensored information to, from and within the island.""  In the 114 th Congress, the House version of the FY2017 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill, H.R. 5912 ( H.Rept.
In final action in March 2018, Congress provided $20 million for democracy programs in Cuba in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ; explanatory statement, Division K) without any of the directives in the House and Senate appropriations bills and reports noted above.
The House Appropriations Committee's State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, H.R. 6385 , would have provided $30 million to promote democracy and strengthen civil society in Cuba, with, according to the report to the bill ( H.Rept.
According to the State Department's 2018 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), issued in March 2018, Cuba has 40 bilateral agreements for antidrug cooperation with countries worldwide, including the 2016 U.S.-Cuban agreement noted above.
Division J (State Department and Foreign Operations), Section 7007, continued a long-standing provision prohibiting direct funding for the government of Cuba (including direct loans, credits, insurance, and guarantees of the Export-Import Bank).
Division K (State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs), Section 7007, continues a long-standing provision prohibiting direct funding for the government of Cuba, including direct loans, credits, insurance, and guarantees of the Export-Import Bank or its agents.
As approved by the Senate, H.R. 5515 had two Cuba-related provisions: Section 1024 would extend the prohibition on the use of funds in FY2019 to close or relinquish control of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Section 1027 would require the Defense Intelligence Agency to submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees within 180 days on security cooperation between Russia and Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela."
217,"For example, membership of the Commission to Recommend Individuals to the President for Appointment to the Office of Architect of the Capitol includes the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the House and the Senate, and the chairmen and the ranking minority members of the Committee on House Administration of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate, the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate."
218,"This report provides an overview of the Pittman-Robertson state and territory programs that support wildlife restoration and hunter education and safety activities, including a breakdown of the various apportionment formulas and an analysis of related issues that may be of interest to Congress.
The total amount of funding available for the Wildlife Restoration program for states is determined by deducting the amounts available for administration, the Basic and Enhanced Hunter Education and Safety programs (Sections 4(c) and 10, respectively), multistate conservation grants, and territorial allocations for wildlife restoration activities from the total amount of revenues generated from the excise taxes on pistols, revolvers, firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment in the previous year.
The amount of funding available for state and territorial apportionments for the Basic Hunter Education and Safety program fluctuates based on annual revenues deposited in the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund from excise taxes on pistols, revolvers, and archery equipment ( Figure 1 )."
219,"Less than two months later Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia's intent to pursue AI technologies, stating, ""[W]hoever becomes the leader in this field will rule the world."" Similarly, the U.S. National Defense Strategy, released in January 2018, identified artificial intelligence as one of the key technologies that will ""ensure [the United States] will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.""  The U.S. military is already integrating AI systems into combat via a spearhead initiative called Project Maven, which uses AI algorithms to identify insurgent targets in Iraq and Syria.
In the meantime, DOD has published a classified AI strategy and is carrying out multiple tasks directed by DOD guidance and the FY2019 NDAA, including establishing a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), which will ""coordinate the efforts of the Department to develop, mature, and transition artificial intelligence technologies into operational use""; publishing a strategic roadmap for AI development and fielding, as well as guidance on ""appropriate ethical, legal, and other policies for the Department governing the development and use of artificial intelligence enabled systems and technologies in operational situations""; establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence; and conducting a comprehensive assessment of militarily relevant AI technologies and providing recommendations for strengthening U.S. competitiveness.
Although DOD funding for AI has increased in 2018—to include the JAIC's $1.75 billion six-year budget and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) $2 billion multiyear investment in over 20 AI programs—some experts have argued that additional DOD funding will be required to keep pace with U.S. competitors and avoid an ""innovation deficit"" in military technology.
The 2017 National Security Strategy identifies a need to ""establish strategic partnerships to align private sector R&D resources to priority national security applications"" and to reward government agencies that ""take risks and rapidly field emerging commercial technologies."" In addition, the Office of Management and Budget directed DOD in preparing its FY2020 budget to ""seek to rapidly field innovative technologies from the private sector, where possible, that are easily adaptable to Federal needs, rather than reinventing solutions in parallel."" Some experts in the national security community also argue that it would not be a responsible use of taxpayer money to duplicate efforts devoted to AI R&D in the commercial sector when companies take products 90% of the way to a useable military application.
In order to combat deep fake technologies, DARPA has launched the Media Forensics (MediFor) project, which seeks to ""automatically detect manipulations, provide detailed information about how these manipulations were performed, and reason about the overall integrity of visual media."" MediFor has developed some initial tools for identifying AI-produced forgeries, but as one analyst has noted, ""a key problem … is that machine-learning systems can be trained to outmaneuver forensics tools."" For this reason, DARPA plans to host follow-on contests to ensure that forensic tools keep pace with deep fake technologies.
For example, in 2017 testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva stated, ""I do not think it is reasonable for us to put robots in charge of whether or not we take a human life."" Regardless, Selva explained that the military will be compelled to address the development of this class of technology in order to find its vulnerabilities, given the fact that potential U.S. adversaries are pursuing LAWS.
One study describes AI as a ""potentially disruptive technology that may create sharp discontinuities in the conduct of warfare,"" further asserting that the technology may ""produce dramatic improvements in military effectiveness and combat potential."" These analysts point to research projects to make existing weapon systems and processes faster and more efficient, as well as providing a means to cope with the proliferation of data that complicate intelligence assessments and decisionmaking."
220,The JJDPA as originally enacted had three main components: (1) it established OJJDP to coordinate and administer federal juvenile justice efforts; (2) it created grant programs to assist states with their juvenile justice systems; and (3) it promulgated core mandates to which states must adhere in order to be eligible for certain grant funding.
221,"That act appropriated $3 million ""for the remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam, and to support health programs in communities near those sites."" After more than a year of internal consultation, the State Department decided that the administration and obligation of the $3 million would be handled by USAID, setting a precedent for the handling of future appropriations for Agent Orange/dioxin assistance to Vietnam.
114-79 , which accompanied P.L. 114-113 , provided ""not less than $25 million"" for environmental remediation and $7 million for ""health/disability programs in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or otherwise contaminated by dioxin, to address the mobility, psycho-social, vocational, and other needs of persons with severe upper and lower body mobility impairment and/or cognitive or developmental disabilities."" The report continued with the statement, ""In order to minimize administrative costs and maximize impact in the field, the Committee intends that, to the maximum extent practicable, health/disability funds shall be implemented by Vietnamese organizations and entities."" Funding for FY2017 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ).
Disability Programs USAID has, in general, utilized the funds Congress appropriated for health/disability activities in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or otherwise contaminated with dioxin as part of its overall program to provide support for persons with disabilities in Vietnam, regardless of the cause of the disability or proximity to Agent Orange ""hot spots."" According to USAID, starting in 1989 with a program financed by the Leahy War Victims Fund, the U.S. government has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, regardless of the cause of the disability."
222,"The Jones Act has been an issue in recent Congresses, coming into prominence amid debates over Puerto Rico's economic challenges and recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017; in the investigation into the sinking of the 40-year-old ship El Faro with 33 fatalities during a hurricane in 2015; and in discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas.
Legislative Context The Jones Act of 1920 was not the first law requiring that vessels transporting cargo domestically be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed.
In 1817, Congress enacted a precursor to the Jones Act by disallowing any vessel wholly or partially foreign-owned from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports (3 Stat.
Shipbuilding Costs Debated The relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries was part of the debate leading up to passage of the Jones Act. Four years earlier, in the Shipping Act of 1916, Congress had requested annual reports on the subject from the federal agency in charge of maritime transportation.
The law stated the following: That it is necessary for the national defense and for the proper growth of its foreign and domestic commerce that the United States shall have a merchant marine of the best equipped and most suitable types of vessels sufficient to carry the greater portion of its commerce and serve as a naval or military auxiliary in times of war or national emergency, ultimately to be owned and operated privately by citizens of the United States; and it is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to do whatever may be necessary to develop and encourage the maintenance of such a merchant marine.
On two occasions, in 1996 ( P.L. 104-324 ) and again in 2011 ( P.L. 112-61 ), Congress has permitted certain foreign-flagged liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers to provide domestic service because none existed in the Jones Act fleet; no ship owners have made use of these exemptions (see Table A-1 ).
Congress has enacted Jones Act waivers for two innovations in vessel designs used in foreign trade but whose cargo operations included domestic legs that technically would otherwise fall under the Jones Act. One concerned a ship designed to carry river barges on international voyages, a technology known as Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH)."
223,"The purpose of the act is to provide for, strengthen, and expedite the national defense by protecting servicemembers, enabling them to ""devote their entire energy to the defense needs of the Nation."" The SCRA protects servicemembers by temporarily suspending certain judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect their legal rights during military service.
Other measures protect military families from being evicted from rental or mortgaged property ; from cancellation of life insurance ; from taxation in multiple jurisdictions ; from foreclosure of property to pay taxes that are due ; and from losing certain rights to public land.
The SCRA provides that no stay, postponement, or suspension of any tax, fine, penalty, insurance premium, or other civil obligation or liability applied for, or received by, a person in military service can be the sole basis for any of the following: 1.
The section applies not just to an action or proceeding in a court but also to any federal or state board, commission, or agency, and may be exercised by the servicemember's heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, regardless of whether the right or cause of action arose prior to or during the person's period of military service.
Title III: Rent, Installment Contracts, Mortgages, Liens, Assignments, Leases, Telephone Service Contracts Sections 301 through 308 provide protections from eviction and loss of other benefits or rights due to the failure of a servicemember to meet payments on rent, loans, mortgages, or insurance policies.
Property foreclosure or other similar action against a servicemember protected by this section taken without benefit of a court order is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year, a fine as provided by Title 18, U.S. Code , or both.
the policy is ""in force"" (premiums have to be paid on time before any benefit guaranteed by these sections of the law can be claimed) for at least 180 days before the insured enters military service.
Nothing in Title V of the SCRA prevents a person in military service from taking any action authorized by law or regulations of the Department of the Interior to assert, perfect, or protect the rights covered in those sections."
224,"DOJ is required to develop and release the system within 210 days of enactment of the First Step Act. The system is to be used to determine the risk of recidivism of each prisoner during the intake process and classify each prisoner as having a minimum, low, medium, or high risk; assess and determine, to the extent practicable, the risk of violent or serious prison misconduct of each prisoner; determine the type and amount of recidivism reduction programming that is appropriate for each prisoner and assign each prisoner to programming based on the prisoner's specific criminogenic needs ; periodically reassess the recidivism risk of each prisoner; reassign prisoners to appropriate recidivism reduction programs or productive activities based on their reassessed risk of recidivism to ensure that all prisoners have an opportunity to reduce their risk classification, that the programs address prisoners' criminogenic needs, and that all prisoners are able to successfully participate in such programs; determine when to provide incentives and rewards for successful participation in recidivism reduction programs or productive activities; determine when a prisoner is ready to transfer into prerelease custody or supervised release; and determine the appropriate use of audio technology for program course materials to accommodate prisoners with dyslexia.
When developing the system, the Attorney General is required to consult with the Director of BOP; the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts; the Director of the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services; the Director of the National Institute of Justice; the Director of the National Institute of Corrections; and the Independent Review Committee, which is established by the First Step Act. When developing the system, the Attorney General, with the assistance of the Independent Review Committee, is required to conduct a review of the existing risk and needs assessment systems; develop recommendations regarding recidivism reduction programs and productive activities; conduct ongoing research and data analysis on (1) evidence-based recidivism reduction programs related to the use of risk and needs assessment, (2) the most effective and efficient uses of such programs, (3) which programs are the most effective at reducing recidivism, and the type, amount, and intensity of programming that most effectively reduces the risk of recidivism, and (4) products purchased by federal agencies that are manufactured overseas and could be manufactured by prisoners participating in a prison work program without reducing job opportunities for other workers in the United States; annually review and validate the risk and needs assessment system, including an evaluation to ensure that assessments are based on dynamic risk factors (i.e., risk factors that can change); validate any tools that the system uses; and evaluate the recidivism rates among similarly classified prisoners to identify any unwarranted disparities, including disparities in such rates among similarly classified prisoners of different demographic groups, and make any changes to the system necessary to address any that are identified; and submit an annual report to Congress each year for five years starting in 2020 (see below).
Department of Justice Report to Congress Two years after the enactment of the First Step Act, and each year thereafter for the next five years, DOJ is required to submit a report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees and the House and Senate Subcommittees on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations that includes information on the types and effectiveness of recidivism reduction programs and productive activities provided by BOP, including the capacity of each program and activity at each prison and any gaps or shortages in capacity of such programs and activities; the recidivism rates of prisoners released from federal prison, based on the following criteria: (1) the primary offense of conviction; (2) the length of the sentence imposed and served; (3) the facility or facilities in which the prisoner's sentence was served; (4) the type of recidivism reduction programming; (5) prisoners' assessed and reassessed risk of recidivism; and (6) the type of productive activities; the status of prison work programs offered by BOP, including a strategy to expanding prison work opportunities for prisoners without reducing job opportunities for nonincarcerated U.S. workers; and any budgetary savings that have resulted from the implementation of the act, and a strategy for investing those savings in other federal, state, and local law enforcement activities and expanding recidivism reduction programs and productive activities at BOP facilities."
225,"The program is also credited with federal income taxes paid by some beneficiaries on a portion of their benefits, reimbursements from the General Fund of the Treasury for various purposes, and interest income from investments held by the Social Security trust funds.
If, in any year, costs are greater than revenues, the cash flow deficit is offset by selling some of the accumulated holdings of the trust funds (U.S. government securities) to help pay benefits and administrative expenses.
When the Social Security trust funds operate with annual cash flow deficits, the U.S. Treasury can continue to pay benefits scheduled under current law as long as the accumulated balance in the trust funds is sufficient to cover the costs."
226,"Introduction This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler shipbuilding program, a program to build a new class of 20 fleet oilers for the Navy.
Issues for Congress regarding the TAO-205 program include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the program; the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations; and whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy."
227,"Finally, patents on pharmaceutical drugs or biologics are subject to specialized patent dispute resolution procedures that can affect a manufacturer's ability to bring a follow-on product (i.e., a generic drug or biosimilar) to market.
Second, it overviews FDA requirements for obtaining approval to market a drug or biological product, the abbreviated pathways for generic drug approval under the Hatch-Waxman Act and biosimilar licensure under the BPCIA, and different regulatory exclusivities that FDA grants to certain types of approved pharmaceutical products.
Patent rights may also affect follow-on market entry indirectly , if a generic or biosimilar manufacturer declines to seek FDA approval because of the number of existing patents relating to a product or the costs of challenging them.
The first distortion affected new drug manufacturers: because obtaining FDA marketing approval could take years, the effective patent life (i.e., the period during which the patentee can derive profit from the invention) was shortened by FDA regulatory requirements.
In response, the Hatch-Waxman Act granted a patent term extension for certain inventions relating to drug products or medical devices based on delays in obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
The result was an ""effective extension of the patent term"" based on the ""combined effect of the patent law and the premarket regulatory approval requirement."" In response, the Hatch-Waxman Act created a ""safe harbor,"" providing that making, using, or selling an invention ""solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs"" is not patent infringement.
The proposed legislation would amend the FTCA to specifically authorize the FTC to initiate enforcement proceedings against parties to ""any agreement resolving or settling, on a final or interim basis, a patent infringement claim, in connection with the sale of a drug product or biological product."" Such agreements would be presumed to have anticompetitive effects and violate antitrust laws if the brand-name company agrees to provide the generic with ""anything of value,"" including monetary payments or distribution licenses, in exchange for the generic company agreeing ""to limit or forego research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales"" of the generic product ""for any period of time."" The presumption would not attach, however, to agreements where the only consideration from the brand-name company is the right to market the product before relevant patents or exclusivities expire, reasonable litigation expenses, or a covenant not to sue for infringement.
Accordingly, the bill would require FDA to expedite review of such applications and ""act within 8 months."" During the period between the Secretary's excessive price determination and follow-on product approval, the bill would prohibit the brand-name drug manufacturer from increasing the price of the drug or biologic."
228,"Introduction Issue for Congress This report provides background information and issues for Congress on three new ship-based weapons being developed by the Navy—solid state lasers (SSLs), the electromagnetic railgun (EMRG), and the gun-launched guided projectile (GLGP), also known as the hypervelocity projectile (HVP)—that could substantially improve the ability of Navy surface ships to defend themselves against surface craft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and eventually anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs).
Similarly, even though GLGPs fired from 5-inch powder guns might not be able to counter anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), they could indirectly improve a ship's ability to counter ASBMs by permitting the ship to use fewer of its SAMs for countering ASCMs and more of its SAMs for countering ASBMs. Navy Shipboard Lasers in Brief SSLs in General The Navy in recent years has leveraged both significant advancements in industrial SSLs and decades of research and development work on military lasers done by other parts of DOD to make substantial progress toward deploying high-energy SSLs on Navy surface ships.
This leveraged knowledge and new HELCAP technical solutions to the C-ASCM problem will enable a fully informed decision to rapidly field an integrated, fleet ready, HEL Weapon."" SSL-TM As a follow-on effort to LaWS and MLD, the Navy initiated the SSL Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) program, in which industry teams led by BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon, among others, competed to develop a shipboard laser with a beam power of up to 150 kW, which would provide increased effectiveness against small boats and UAVs. Technology developed in the SSL-TM effort will support development of the SNLWS Increment 2 system.
RHEL RHEL reportedly is ""a 150-kilowatt laser that will apparently employ 'different laser architectures' that will handle more powerful laser beams eventually."" The Navy's FY2020 budget submission states that Budget Activity 3 development (i.e., advanced technology development) associated with RHEL was completed in FY2019; that HELCAP, discussed below, was previously known as RHEL Phase II; and that HELCAP will leverage, among other things, ""Alternative Laser Sources for higher powers, also known as the Ruggedized High Energy Laser (RHEL) activities."" Congress added about $11.6 million in development funding for RHEL in FY2018; the funding was used for ""long lead procurement for the beam director required to support integrated laser weapons system testing, mission analysis, lethality and defeat of anti-ship cruise missile threats."" SNLWS Increment 1 (HELIOS) SNLWS Increment 1 is called HELIOS, an acronym meaning high energy laser with integrated optical dazzler and surveillance.
A February 27, 2017, press report states that The Navy has established programs for high-energy lasers and the electromagnetic railgun at Naval Sea Systems Command acquisition directorates, paving the way for technologies that have long been stuck in research and development to potentially be installed on the service's ships one day."
229,"Introduction The U.S. State Department welcomed opposition figure Felix Tshisekedi's victory in DRC's December 2018 presidential election, applauding the Congolese people ""for their insistence on a peaceful and democratic transfer of power."" Election day was indeed largely peaceful, and alternate scenarios that outgoing President Joseph Kabila might have preferred (e.g., his own reelection or the election of his chosen successor, former Interior Minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary) ultimately did not materialize.
Prior to the 2016-2018 impasse over the elections delay and Kabila's political future, international attention toward DRC was overwhelmingly focused on addressing long-running conflicts in the east and supporting the extension of state authority.
Ahead of a visit by Tshisekedi to Washington, DC in April 2019, the State Department pledged to work with the new president ""to advance his agenda to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, enhance security, protect human rights and promote economic growth through increased foreign investment and trade, particularly with the United States."" Enduring conflicts and humanitarian suffering in the east both reflect and contribute to regional instability.
Most recently, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, restricts International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds for any government in Africa's Great Lakes region until the Secretary of State reports that it is not involved in ""destabilizing activities in a neighboring country"" (§7042([a] of Division F, P.L. 116-6 ).
Members continue to debate the impact of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 111-203 ), requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the disclosure by U.S. firms of their use of designated ""conflict minerals"" originating in DRC or neighboring states."
230,"A 1986 CIA report went further, citing ""the advantage of long-range missiles to deliver warheads quickly, virtually without warning, and-unlike aircraft-without facing any defense"" as a ""factor"" that would incentivize Iranian development of nuclear weapons ""in the late 1990s."" A 1995 U.S. intelligence report stated that Iran was ""aggressively pursuing a nuclear weapons capability and, if significant foreign assistance were provided, could produce a weapon by the end of the decade."" Somewhat less urgently, an Arms Control and Disarmament Agency report covering 1995 observed that ""Iran's rudimentary program has apparently met with limited success so far, [but] we believe Iran has not abandoned its efforts to expand its nuclear capabilities with a view to supporting nuclear weapons development.""  In 1996 congressional testimony, then-Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch described Iranian efforts to acquire from the former Soviet Union fissile material for a nuclear weapon: In an attempt to shorten the timeline to a weapon, Iran has launched a parallel effort to purchase fissile material, mainly from sources in the former Soviet Union.
A Swedish official involved in that country's nuclear weapons program ""argued that the main aim should be the generation of nuclear energy, with plutonium production, which would make possible the manufacture of nuclear weapons as a side-effect."" Moreover, a 1975 U.S. intelligence assessment argued that countries might develop an ""unweaponized"" nuclear explosive device ""to further their political, and even military, objectives.""  The main source of proliferation concern generated by Iran's nuclear program has been Tehran's construction of gas centrifuge uranium-enrichment facilities.
German Minister of State Niels Annen argued in a February 19, 2019, speech that the JCPOA ""effectively prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon for as long as the agreement stands."" However, following the May 8, 2018, U.S. announcement that the United States would no longer participate in the JCPOA and would reimpose sanctions that had been suspended pursuant to the agreement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ordered the AEOI to ""go ahead with adequate preparations to resume enrichment at the industrial level without any limit."" A year later, Rouhani announced additional Iranian responses.
In a January 2018 letter, Iran informed the IAEA of the government's ""decision … to construct naval nuclear propulsion in future."" Tehran explained in an April 2018 letter to the agency that ""[f]or the first five years, no [nuclear] facility will be involved"" and the ""[n]uclear fuelled engines/reactors will be used for civilian purpose."" Salehi stated in early February 2019 that at the project will take ""at least 15 years"" to complete.
Consistent with ElBaradei's statement, IAEA Director-General Yukiya Amano explained in a 2012 interview that the IAEA did not claim that ""Iran [has] made a decision to obtain nuclear weapons."" Notably, Tehran has implemented various restrictions on, and provided the IAEA with additional information about, its uranium enrichment program and heavy-water reactor program pursuant to the JCPOA.
One group advocated engagement with the West, while others were proponents of resistance."" President Rouhani, who headed the 2003-2005 negotiations, explained during a July 2005 interview that certain parts of the Iranian government opposed the diplomatic track, adding that ""[t]he problems included both disharmony and sabotage."" Indeed, Rouhani later argued that Iran's Supreme National Security Council took charge of the diplomacy concerning the nuclear program because  the Foreign Ministry was not able to be responsible for this task in a good way because some organizations did not pay sufficient attention to this ministry's decisions, especially since there had been disagreements for months between the Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization.
According to this report, which provided the most detailed account to date of the IAEA's evidence regarding Iran's suspected nuclear weapons-related activities, the agency has ""credible"" information that Iran has carried out activities ""relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device,"" including acquisition of ""nuclear weapons development information and documentation,"" work to develop ""an indigenous design of a nuclear weapon including the testing of components,"" efforts ""to procure nuclear related and dual use equipment and materials by military related individuals and entities,"" and work to ""develop undeclared pathways for the production of nuclear material."" Although some of these activities have civilian applications, ""others are specific to nuclear weapons,"" the report notes.
Iran signed a joint statement with the IAEA on November 11, 2013, describing a ""Framework for Cooperation."" According to the statement, Iran and the IAEA agreed to ""strengthen their cooperation and dialogue aimed at ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme through the resolution of all outstanding issues that have not already been resolved by the IAEA."" Tehran subsequently provided the IAEA with information about several of the outstanding issues and later agreed in May 2014 to provide information to the agency by August 25, 2014, about five additional issues, including alleged Iranian research on high explosives and ""studies made and/or papers published in Iran in relation to neutron transport and associated modelling and calculations and their alleged application to compressed materials."" Iran subsequently provided information about four of these issues.
Road Map to Assessing Possible Military Dimensions The July 2015 JCPOA states that Tehran was to ""complete"" a series of steps set out in an Iran-IAEA ""Roadmap for Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues."" According to IAEA Director-General Amano, this road map, which the two sides concluded in July 2015, set out ""a process"" under the November 2013 JPA ""to enable the Agency, with the cooperation of Iran, to make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme."" According to a December 2, 2015, report to the IAEA Board of Governors from Amano, ""[a]ll the activities contained in the road-map were implemented in accordance with the agreed schedule."" The road map required Amano to present this report, which contains the agency's ""final assessment on the resolution"" of the aforementioned outstanding issues.
At that time, IAEA officials conducted and supervised verification activities, including ""visual observation and environmental sampling,"" but they ""did not observe a chamber or any associated equipment inside the building."" Iranian officials told their IAEA counterparts in October 2015 that the building in question ""had always been used for the storage of chemical material for the production of explosives,"" but the ""information available"" to the IAEA, ""does not support Iran's statements on the purpose of the building."" Beginning in February 2012, Iran apparently undertook efforts to remove evidence of past nuclear-related activities at the site.
ElBaradei's February 2008 report underscored the importance of full Iranian cooperation with the IAEA investigation, as well as Tehran's implementation of its Additional Protocol: Confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme requires that the Agency be able to provide assurances not only regarding declared nuclear material, but, equally importantly, regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran....
As noted above, Iran has said that it does not plan to engage in reprocessing, and IAEA Director-General Amano's November 2011 report described an ""absence of any indicators that Iran is currently considering reprocessing irradiated nuclear fuel to extract plutonium."" Amano's November 2015 report states that the agency could ""confirm that there are no ongoing reprocessing related activities"" at the Iranian facilities to which the agency has access.
A 2012 Department of Defense report described Amano's report as containing ""extensive evidence of past and possibly ongoing Iranian nuclear weapons-related research and development work."" (See Appendix E for more details about the IAEA's information regarding suspected military aspects of Iran's nuclear program.) Amano's November 2011 report states that, according to information available to the IAEA, Iranian activities related to building a nuclear explosive device ""took place under a structured programme"" prior to the end of 2003.
According to a 2011 International Institute for Strategic Studies report, ""the fabrication of an initial bomb would involve an amount of unavoidable wastage."" Then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl explained during a November 15, 2011, hearing that ""the time to actually complete a testable [Iranian nuclear] device could shrink over time.""  Then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta told 60 Minutes in 2012 that, if Iran were to decide to build a nuclear weapon, ""it would probably take them about a year to be able to produce a bomb and then possibly another one to two years in order to put it on a deliverable vehicle of some sort in order to deliver that weapon."" Although, as noted, the United States estimated that Iran's Fordow enrichment facility ""would be capable of producing approximately one weapon's worth"" of HEU per year, whether and how that assessment factored into the U.S. timelines for Iranian nuclear weapons development is unclear.
However, the 2007 NIE states that Iran ""probably would use covert facilities—rather than its declared nuclear sites—for the production of highly enriched uranium for a weapon."" Similarly, a CIA report covering 2004 concluded that ""inspections and safeguards will most likely prevent Tehran from using facilities declared to the IAEA directly for its weapons program as long as Iran remains a party to the NPT."" Director Clapper echoed this assessment in a March 2015 interview.
According to former Deputy Assistant Secretary Kahl, Tehran ""is unlikely to dash for a bomb in the near future because IAEA inspectors would probably detect Iranian efforts to divert low-enriched uranium and enrich it to weapons-grade level at declared facilities."" Similarly, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Media Operations John Kirby told reporters on December 21, 2011, that were Iran to begin producing a nuclear weapon, IAEA inspectors would likely give sufficient warning for the United States to take action.
According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the AEOI ""has operational and regulatory control over Iran's nuclear program,"" ""reports directly to the Iranian President,"" and is the ""main Iranian organization responsible for research and development activities in the field of nuclear technology."" Iran's Minister of Science, Research and Technology stated in January 2019 that ""the AEOI acts upon decisions made by the country's Supreme National Security Council."" The AEOI has been Tehran's main interlocutor with the IAEA."
231,"The result of the task force's work was the introduction of H.Res. 895 (110 th Congress) and the creation of the Office of Congressional Ethics to collect information from the public; investigate Members, officers, and staff of the House of Representatives; and provide that information to the House Committee on Ethics.
Mr. Wolfensberger further suggested that the House ethics process could be strengthened if the chair and ranking Member kept the full committee membership apprised of the status of all complaints filed with the committee; the full committee determined when an investigative subcommittee should be created; an investigative subcommittee was not allowed to enter into an agreement with a respondent, but instead recommended a proposed settlement that the full committee could finalize, modify, or reject; when an investigative subcommittee report did not adopt a statement of alleged violation, it should be sent to the House (and public) and not to the full committee; and the committee's authority to issue a letter of reproval or other appropriate action be available, as a matter of privilege, for possible House action.
The report recommended the creation of an Office of Congressional Ethics as an independent office within the House to ""review information on allegations of misconduct by members, officers, and employees of the House and make recommendations to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for the Committee's official consideration and action.""  The task force proposed a six-member entity to investigate possible violations of House rules.
The report stated that ""[t]he new Office of Congressional Ethics will act as an origination point for independent review of possible violations of standards of conduct, but will not prevent the Standards Committee from accepting complaints filed by members."" In a press release accompanying the report, Representative Capuano reported that the task force was recommending that a nonpartisan professional staff be hired by the panel, and current House Members and lobbyists not be permitted to serve on the panel; the OCE conduct preliminary reviews, then refer all matters subject to a second-phase review to the Committee on Standards for disposition; if no merit is found, the board may recommend dismissal; the OCE be given up to 30 calendar days or 5 legislative days, whichever was greater, to conduct a preliminary review, and 45 calendar days or 5 legislative days to review a matter in the second phase before referral to the Committee on Standards; the Committee on Standards be given up to 45 calendar or 5 legislative days, whichever was greater, to consider the matter as allowed pursuant to current Committee on Standards Rules 16b-16e; and the Committee on Standards be required to make a public statement, or finding, on referrals from the OCE by the end of the 45-calendar-day or 5-legislative-day period.

232,"The roles of U.S. polar icebreakers can be summarized as follows: conducting and supporting scientific research in the Arctic and Antarctic; defending U.S. sovereignty in the Arctic by helping to maintain a U.S. presence in U.S. territorial waters in the region; defending other U.S. interests in polar regions, including economic interests in waters that are within the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) north of Alaska; monitoring sea traffic in the Arctic, including ships bound for the United States; and conducting other typical Coast Guard missions (such as search and rescue, law enforcement, and protection of marine resources) in Arctic waters, including U.S. territorial waters north of Alaska.
The Coast Guard's strategy document for the Arctic region, released on May 21, 2013, states that ""The United States must have adequate icebreaking capability to support research that advances fundamental understanding of the region and its evolution,"" and that ""The Nation must also make a strategic investment in icebreaking capability to enable access to the high latitudes over the long-term."" Current U.S. Polar Icebreakers The operational U.S. polar icebreaking fleet currently consists of one heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Star , and one medium polar icebreaker, Healy .
An April 25, 2019, press report states that ""the Coast Guard and Navy said VT Halter Marine's winning design for the new Polar Security Cutter (PSC) 'meets or exceeds all threshold requirements' in the ship specification"" for the PSC program.
An April 15, 2019, press report states: The Coast Guard's fiscal year 2020 budget request of $35 million for its new heavy icebreaker is insufficient for the purchase of long-lead time materials to maintain the program schedule, Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) said April 9th in his opening remarks at a House Homeland Security Transportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee hearing with the heads of the Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration.
A September 2018 GAO report on the PSC program states that the Coast Guard did not have a sound business case in March 2018, when it established the cost, schedule, and performance baselines for its heavy polar icebreaker acquisition program, because of risks in four key areas: Design.
An April 12, 2018, press report states the following: As the Coast Guard prepares to review industry bids for a new heavy polar icebreaker, the service is keeping its options open for the right number and mix of polar icebreakers it will need in the future, Adm. Paul Zukunft, the [then-]commandant of the Coast Guard, said on Wednesday [April 11].
A September 25, 2017, GAO report on polar icebreakers states the following: While the Coast Guard considered various options to bridge this potential heavy icebreaker gap, in a January 2017 study the Coast Guard reported that it was planning for a limited service life extension of the Polar Star to keep it operational until fiscal year 2025, at an initial cost estimate of $75 million.
A July 2018 GAO report states the following: The Coast Guard is planning a SLEP on the Polar Star to keep it operational until the first and second new heavy polar icebreakers are delivered (planned for 2023 and 2025, according to current acquisition plans) in order to bridge a potential operational gap.
At a June 14, 2016, hearing on Coast Guard mission needs and resource allocation before the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation subcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the following exchange occurred: REPRESENTATIVE HUNTER (Chairman): How do you plan on—on filling the capability gap until you get a heavy icebreaker, which is 10 years at the least based on the best projections of Congress and everybody working together?
It can also be noted, as stated in the above-quoted passage from the MNS, that the MNS was informed by the High Latitude Mission Analysis Report (HILMAR), and that the HLMAR took into account not only Coast Guard statutory mission requirements, but additional Department of Defense (DOD) requirements for year-round presence in both polar regions as detailed in the 2010 Naval Operations Concept (NOC).
In briefings at its first meeting, the committee learned that the National Science Foundation and other agencies do not have budgets to support full-time heavy icebreaker access or the incremental cost of design, even though their science programs may require this capability.
In briefings at its first meeting, the committee learned that the National Science Foundation and other agencies do not have budgets to support full-time heavy icebreaker access or the incremental cost of design, even though their science programs may require this capability.
Regarding current polar icebreaking capabilities for performing Arctic missions, the report states the following: The Coast Guard's icebreaking resources are unlikely to meet future demands.
The report made the following conclusions and recommendations: Based on the current and future needs for icebreaking capabilities, the [study] committee concludes that the nation continues to require a polar icebreaking fleet that includes a minimum of three multimission ships [like the Coast Guard's three current polar icebreakers] and one single-mission [research] ship [like Palmer].
National interests in the polar regions require that the United States immediately program, budget, design, and construct two new polar icebreakers to be operated by the U.S. Coast Guard."
233,"Introduction The last several years have seen renewed debate over the role that race plays in higher education—a debate over ""affirmative action."" A high-profile lawsuit challenging Harvard University's consideration of race in admitting its incoming classes, and the recent withdrawal of Obama Administration-era guidance addressing similar race-conscious policies, have focused the debate on ""affirmative action"" in perhaps its more familiar sense: the voluntary consideration of student applicants' race as a way of increasing the participation of racial minorities in higher education.
Though the Supreme Court held decades ago that state-sanctioned racial segregation in higher education violates the Equal Protection Clause, such intentional segregation, or practices arising from formerly de jure segregated university systems and their discriminatory effects, may still persist.
The Supreme Court vacated the state court's decision, concluding that in the case of admitting a black student ""to a graduate professional school, there [wa]s no reason for delay"" and that he was ""entitled to prompt admission under the rules and regulations applicable to other qualified candidates."" The Affirmative Duty to Eliminate De Jure Segregation in Higher Education Following Brown I and Brown II , the Court's equal protection jurisprudence in the public education context expanded significantly to address questions regarding the scope and sufficiency of state actions to ""dismantle"" racially segregated systems in public school districts across the country, and various challenges to district court-ordered remedies.
First , the analysis examines whether the challenged policy or practice maintained by the state is ""traceable to its prior [ de jure ] system."" By way of example, the Court identified four policies that, in its view, were ""readily apparent"" vestiges of de jure segregation: admissions standards based on a test-score range originally adopted for discriminatory reasons; unnecessary program duplication throughout the university system (e.g., multiple institutions offering the same ""nonbasic"" courses); the state's academic mission assignments to its higher education institutions (e.g., assigning the broadest academic missions to only formerly white-only institutions and the narrowest academic mission to a formerly black-only institution); and the continued operation of all public universities established in the de jure segregated system.
Where traceability is not shown—that is, where the policies ""do not have such historical antecedents"" to de jure segregation—an equal protection challenge would then require ""a showing of discriminatory purpose."" In those instances, the Court explained, ""the question becomes whether the fact of racial separation establishes a new violation of the Fourteenth Amendment under traditional principles."" Second , once traceability is shown, the analysis turns to whether those traceable policies have continued discriminatory or ""segregative"" effects in student choice, enrollment, or other facets of the university system.
Regarding the fate of a state's historically black institutions, Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, did not read Fordice to ""forbid[]"" those institutions' continued operation or ""foreclose the possibility that there exists 'sound educational justification' for maintaining historically black colleges as such ."" Justice Thomas emphasized that ""[d]espite the shameful history of state-enforced segregation,"" historically black colleges and universities were and remain institutions critical to the academic flourishing and leadership development of many students, and observed that ""[i]t would be ironic, to say the least, if the institutions that sustained blacks during segregation were themselves destroyed in an effort to combat its vestiges."" In his view, though a state is not constitutionally required to maintain its historically black institutions as such, their continued operation is constitutionally permissible, so long as admission is open to all students ""on a race-neutral basis, but with established traditions and programs that might disproportionately appeal to one race or another."" Legal Challenges Following Fordice Following Fordice , plaintiffs, including the United States in Title VI enforcement actions, have brought suit challenging practices allegedly traceable to a state's de jure segregated university system."

Social Issues and Security Concerns Islamic Sharia Law Nigeria is home to one of the world's largest Muslim populations.
An estimate by the International Crisis Group suggests that over 2011-2016, roughly 2,000 Nigerians died annually in herder-farmer clashes, which surged in 2016 to claim some 2,500 lives—more than the total killed in Boko Haram-related violence that year.
A July 2018 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace concluded that ""decades of unchecked corruption have hollowed out the Nigerian military and security services and rendered them unable to effectively combat Boko Haram or address ethno-religious and communal conflict."" The State Department has also identified other dynamics limiting the response, including a lack of coordination and cooperation between Nigerian security agencies, limited database use, the slow pace of the judicial system with regard to charging and trying suspected militants, and a lack of sufficient training for prosecutors and judges to implement antiterrorism laws.
The International Crisis Group, among others, has called for comprehensive defense sector reform, including ""a drastic improvement in leadership, oversight, administration and accountability across the sector.""  Boko Haram's Fracture and the Emergence of Islamic State-West Africa Boko Haram currently appears to pose a threat primarily in northern Nigeria and surrounding areas in neighboring countries.
In a mid-2018 visit to the White House, President Buhari announced that Nigeria and the United States were collaborating to secure ""the return to Nigeria of over 500 million United States dollars of looted funds siphoned away in banks around the world."" Other governments are reportedly assisting in that repatriation effort.
Nigeria was one of four country recipients of a $40 million Global Security Contingency Fund regional program launched in 2014 to counter Boko Haram."
237,"Congress directs and oversees the specific navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration projects that USACE plans and constructs through authorization legislation, annual and supplemental appropriations legislation, and oversight efforts.
The report discusses the following topics: primer on the agency and its authorization legislation, typically titled as a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA); standard process for planning and construction of USACE water resource projects; interest in and authorities for alternative project delivery and innovative finance for water resource projects; and other USACE authorities, including its authorities for Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs) and technical assistance, emergency response, and reimbursable work.
Appendix B provides an overview of Water Resources Development Acts and other USACE civil works omnibus authorization bills enacted from 1986 through 2018, which are collectively referred to herein as WRDAs. Primer on the Agency and Its Authorization  The civil works program is led by a civilian Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, who reports to the Secretary of the Army.
In recent decades, Congress has legislated on most USACE authorizations through WRDAs. Congress uses WRDA legislation to authorize USACE water resource studies, projects, and programs and to establish policies (e.g., nonfederal cost-share requirements).
115-929 , stated the following: The conferees are opposed to the proposed reorganization as it could ultimately have detrimental impacts for implementation of the Civil Works program and for numerous non-federal entities that rely on the Corps' technical expertise, including in response to natural disasters.… Further, this type of proposal, as the Department of Defense and the Corps are well aware, will require enactment of legislation, which has neither been proposed nor requested to date.
In Section 1102 of WRDA 2018, Congress required that the Secretary of the Army to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the following: USACE's ability of carry out its mission and responsibilities and the potential effects of transferring functions and resources from the Department of Defense to a new or existing federal agency; and how to improve USACE's project delivery, taking into account the annual appropriations process, the leadership and geographic structure at the divisions and districts, and the rotation of senior USACE leaders.
In Section 1103 of WRDA 2018, Congress required that the Secretary of the Army contract with the NAS to do the following: review the economic principles and methods used by the USACE to formulate, evaluate, and budget for water resources development projects, and recommend changes to improve transparency, return on federal investment, cost savings, and prioritization in USACE budgeting of these projects.
(For more information on NEPA compliance and cost-benefit analyses, see the box ""USACE Feasibility Studies: National Environmental Policy Act Compliance and Economic Analyses."") The evaluation of USACE water resource projects is governed by the 1983 Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Resources Implementation Studies (often referred to as the P&G) and by policy direction provided in WRDA bills and other enacted legislation."
238,"When her predecessor, John Boehner, R-OH, was elected minority leader in the 110 th Congress (2007-2008), he had served in the House for 18 years including as majority leader, committee chair (Education and the Workforce), and, prior to that, chair of the Republican Conference.
Until the 61 st Congress (1909-1910), ""it was the custom to have the minority leader also serve as the ranking minority member on the two most powerful committees, Rules and Ways and Means."" Today, the minority leader no longer serves on these committees but does chair the Republican Steering Committee, a party leadership committee responsible for making recommendations to the Conference regarding the committee assignments of House Republicans.
Republican Conference rules also authorize the minority leader to appoint a ""Leadership Member"" to the Committee on the Budget who ""will serve as the second highest-ranking Republican on the committee,"" and to ""recommend to the House all Republican Members of such joint, select, and ad hoc committees as shall be created by the House, in accordance with law."" Beyond their formal responsibilities, minority leaders are expected to handle a wide range of informal party assignments."

240,"The 2008 and 2014 farm bills further expanded provisions governing how RMA administers and implements Section 508(h) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, which governs new policy development, including how it is contracted out and funded, how policy ratings are undertaken, and how a policy may start as a pilot and may (or may not) evolve to a full-fledged insurance policy.
WFRP is discussed further in "" Whole Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) Insurance ."" Despite expansion of the federal crop insurance program, coverage for specialty crops remains below that for traditional crops in terms of individual crop policies and covered acres.
In some cases, USDA has not pursued policies for particular commodities because producers have expressed concerns that offering insurance could adversely affect the market (i.e., because an insurance policy reduces producer risk, farmers may plant more acreage, which could drive down prices and total crop revenue).
Unlike many traditional commodity crops, specialty crops are generally not eligible for USDA farm revenue support programs—that is, programs such as the Agricultural Risk Loss Coverage (ARC), Price Loss Coverage (PLC), and Marketing Assistance Loans (MAL) programs."
241,"The OAA Reauthorization Act of 2016 Amendments ( P.L. 114-144 ) reduces state and U.S. territory hold harmless amounts (previously referenced to FY2006 funding levels) by 1% from the previous fiscal year as follows:  For FY2017, no state receives less than 99% of the annual amount allotted to the state in FY2016.
The OAA Amendments of 2000 and 2006 The Title III funding formula for supportive services and senior centers, the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, and disease prevention and health promotion services has been a point of controversy in recent congressional attempts to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. Initially, Congress was concerned that the method AOA used to distribute Title III funds was inconsistent with statutory requirements, thereby negatively affecting states experiencing faster growth in their older population.
The OAA 2006 Amendments ultimately resulted in changes to the law as follows: (1) Congress changed the formula to ensure that, provided sufficient funds, every state receives at least its FY2006 amount (creating a new fiscal year ""hold harmless"" amount); and (2) Congress phased out the ""guaranteed growth"" provision, reducing the share of any increase in appropriations from 20% to 0 by 5 percentage points annually beginning in FY2008.
It also made various amendments to existing OAA authorities, including changes to the statutory funding formula for the supportive services and senior centers, congregate nutrition, home-delivered nutrition, and disease prevention and health promotion services under Title III of the act, which lessens the effect of the hold harmless provision over time."
242,"The capital ratio is the ratio of capital to the total dollar amount of mortgages insured under the MMI Fund.) As will be discussed in more detail later in this report, the MMI Fund, like all federal loan and loan guarantee programs subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, has permanent and indefinite budget authority to receive funds from the Department of the Treasury to cover increases in the costs of loan guarantees made in prior years.
The capital ratio falling below 2%, and then turning negative, raised concerns that the MMI Fund would not have enough money to cover all of its expected future losses on the loans that it was currently insuring.
If FHA's single-family program were ever estimated to have a positive credit subsidy rate for the upcoming fiscal year, it would require an appropriation to cover the difference between the amount of money FHA expected to take in and pay out over the life of the loans.
In the years following the housing market turmoil that began around 2007, the credit subsidy rate re-estimates showed aggregate increases in expected losses on FHA-insured loans, requiring large transfers of funds from the Capital Reserve Account to the Financing Account to cover these additional expected future losses.
In contrast, the FY2018 economic value of positive $34.9 billion means that the MMI Fund would be estimated to have that amount left over after all of the expected future cash flows (including premium payments and insurance claims) on its currently insured mortgages were realized.
Table 3 shows the MMI Fund's financial position, including its economic value, dollar volume of insured mortgages, and capital ratio, as estimated by the independent actuary and FHA for each fiscal year between FY2006 and FY2018."
243,"The long-established rule of grand jury secrecy is enshrined in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which provides that government attorneys and the jurors themselves, among others, ""must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury."" Accordingly, as a general matter, persons and entities external to the grand jury process are precluded from obtaining transcripts of grand jury testimony or other documents or information that would reveal ""what took place"" in the proceedings, even if the grand jury has concluded its work and even if the information is sought pursuant to otherwise-valid legal processes.
First, such matters ""other than [the jury's] deliberations and the vote of any juror"" automatically could be disclosed to ""the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties."" Beyond this, ""a juror, attorney, interpreter or stenographer"" could disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only with court authorization (1) ""preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,"" or (2) ""at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury."" Amendments to Rule 6(e) from 1966 to 2014 have sought, among other things, to align the Rule's text with court-developed exceptions and clarifications that have sometimes extended beyond the literal terms of the version of the Rule in force at a given point in time.
In the second category of exceptions, the court under whose auspices the grand jury was empaneled may authorize disclosure of a grand jury matter (1) preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding; (2) to a defendant who shows grounds may exist to dismiss the indictment because of something that occurred before the grand jury; or (3) at the request of the government, to a foreign court or prosecutor or to an ""appropriate"" state, state-subdivision, Indian tribal, military, or foreign government official for the purpose of enforcing or investigating a violation of the respective jurisdiction's criminal law.
Conversely, courts have rejected the argument that a proceeding instituted primarily or solely to obtain grand jury materials can itself be considered the ""judicial proceeding"" needed to justify disclosure, recognizing that such a reading of the exception would be circular and ""rule-swallowing."" With respect to the ""preliminarily to or in connection with"" requirement, the Supreme Court has said that the relevant inquiry is the use for which the grand jury information is being requested: ""the Rule contemplates only uses related fairly directly to some identifiable litigation, pending or anticipated."" Thus, ""it is not enough to show that some litigation may emerge from the matter in which the material is to be used, or even that litigation is .
Disclosure is limited to grand jury testimony that ""relate[s] to the subject matter of the [trial] testimony of the witness."" The purpose of these limitations is to balance a defendant's right to confront his accusers using information that may impeach their testimony with the need to protect government files ""from unnecessary and vexatious fishing expeditions by defendants."" Disclosure Mechanics and Review Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(F) and (G) address the procedures for seeking court-authorized disclosure of grand jury materials for use in connection with another judicial proceeding."
244,"Compared with the request, the enacted bill cuts: $213 million to force DOD to deal with what House and Senate conferees labelled ""excess growth"" in the cost of pharmaceuticals; $215 million in anticipation that the funds will not be needed because the program will continue to exhibit its pattern of historical underexecution; and $597 million to correct what the House Appropriations Committee said was erroneous accounting for congressional action on the FY2018 DHP budget.
For dozens of additional cuts from the base budget O&M request, House-Senate conferees cited rationales that imply that the reductions need not have an adverse impact on DOD activities: Cuts totaling $1.3 billion were justified by the assumption that particular programs would underspend their budget requests by that amount, often on the basis of what the conferees called a pattern of historic al underexecution of their annual appropriations; Cuts totaling $1.3 billion were justified on grounds that DOD had not justified its request for those funds; and Cuts totaling $343 million were justified on grounds that the requests amounted to unrealistically large increases over the prior year's appropriation."

246,"National Guard and Reserve GFOs are not addressed in this report, unless they are serving on active duty in a manner that counts against the active duty caps on GFOs. Given the authority granted to general and flag officers, Congress has developed a statutory framework applicable to this elite group, and considers changes to these laws as it deems appropriate.
Responsibilities of General and Flag Officer Positions While Congress has specified functions or duties for some key positions—such as members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Combatant Commanders, the top two officers of each service, the Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau —the great majority of GFO positions are not defined in statute.
In these instances DOD uses the following criteria for determining whether a position should be filled by a general or flag officer: Nature, characteristics, and function of the position; Grade and position of superior, principal subordinates, and lateral points of coordination; Degree of independence of operation; Official relations with other U.S. and foreign governmental positions; Magnitude of responsibilities; Mission and special requirements; Number, type, and value of resources managed and employed; Forces, personnel, value of equipment, total obligation authority; Geographic area of responsibility; Authority to make decisions and commit resources; Development of policy; National commitment to international agreements; Impact on national security and other national interests; and Effect on the prestige of the nation or the armed force Historical Changes in General and Flag Officer Levels A summary of the number of active duty GFOs and the proportion of GFOs relative to the total force over the past five decades is provided in Table 3 ."
247,"First, the report examines how federal courts have understood Title IX's requirements in the context of private rights of actions brought by students directly against educational institutions seeking damages for sexual abuse or harassment.
""Actual"" Notice of Discrimination by ""An Appropriate Person"" Before reaching the issue of whether a funding recipient acted with ""deliberate indifference,"" Gebser requires that a plaintiff establish that ""an appropriate person"" at the funding recipient had ""actual knowledge of discrimination."" Failure to show either ""actual"" notice or that such notice was provided to ""an appropriate person"" of the funding recipient may constitute the sole basis for a court's dismissal of a Title IX claim seeking damages for sexual harassment or abuse.
As for ""substantial control"" over the environment, ""the harassment must take place in a context subject to the school district's control.""  As to the nature of the sexual harassment itself, Davis requires that the plaintiff show that the conduct ""is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and [] so undermines and detracts from the victims' educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities."" Whether the conduct rises to this level depends, as the Court stated in Davis , ""on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships,"" ""including, but not limited to, the ages of the harasser and the victim and the number of individuals involved."" Finally, for harassment to have sufficiently affected the victim's education, the Court in Davis made two additional observations.
Yet, the Court also concluded that harassment is actionable under Title IX only when it is ""serious enough to have the systemic effect of denying the victim equal access to an educational program or activity."" Without defining what might constitute a ""systemic effect,"" the Court offered one example of harassment that does not have such effect: ""a single instance"" of harassment, even when ""sufficiently severe."" Federal Courts' Application of Gebser and Davis to Title IX Claims for Sexual Harassment or Abuse The Supreme Court's Gebser and Davis decisions establish that a school or other educational program that receives federal funding will be liable under Title IX for damages for the sexual abuse or harassment of a student only if it acted with ""deliberate indifference"" in its response to known discrimination.
Some courts, for example, have interpreted Gebser and Davis to adopt a ""hostile environment"" analysis of Title IX claims alleging teacher-to-student harassment, in light of precedent analyzing harassment claims in the workplace context under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Meanwhile, other federal courts have focused their teacher-to-student analysis on whether a plaintiff has established the following elements:  ""actual"" notice of discrimination; by an ""appropriate person"" authorized to take corrective measures; and ""deliberate indifference"" by the funding recipient in response to known discrimination.
The Supreme Court's liability standard for Title IX not only requires actual notice, but also that this notice be made to ""an appropriate person""—that is, ""an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf."" Generally, federal appellate case law reflects that rather than treating an individual's title as dispositive, courts engage in fact-specific determinations that appear to focus principally on whether an individual had the ability to halt or address the misconduct or whether the individual occupied a position high enough within the hierarchy of the funding recipient to be fairly said to act in a representative capacity for the recipient.
Deliberate Indifference: A ""Clearly Unreasonable"" Response As discussed earlier, after establishing ""actual notice"" of the discrimination to an ""appropriate person,"" a plaintiff must additionally prove that the funding recipient acted with deliberate indifference in its response—that is, that the entity acted in a manner that was "" clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances."" Federal appellate courts interpret this standard to require more than a showing that the school or institution failed to respond or act reasonably, or was negligent."
248,"The Navy's annual 30-year shipbuilding plan, for example, groups the Navy's surface combatants into LSCs and SSCs. LSC Force Levels In December 2016, the Navy released a goal to achieve and maintain a Navy of 355 ships, including 104 LSCs. At the end of FY2018, the Navy's force of LSCs totaled 88 ships, including 22 Ticonderoga (CG-47) class cruisers and 66 Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class destroyers.
In FY2017, the Navy shifted DDG-51 procurement to the Flight III DDG-51 design, which incorporates a new and more capable radar called the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) or SPY-6 radar and associated changes to the ship's electrical power and cooling systems.
The Navy began exploring options for procuring a less expensive (and less capable) replacement munition for the AGSs. The Navy to date has not announced a replacement munition for the AGSs. In the meantime, it was reported in December 2017 that, due to shifts in the international security environment and resulting shifts in Navy mission needs, the mission orientation of the DDG-1000s will be shifted from an emphasis on NSFS to an emphasis on surface strike, meaning the use of missiles to attack surface ships and perhaps also land targets.
October 2018 CBO Report An October 2018 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report on the cost of the Navy's shipbuilding programs stated the following about the Flight III DDG-51: To meet combatant commanders' goal of improving future ballistic missile defense capabilities beyond those provided by existing DDG-51s—and to replace 15 Ticonderoga class cruisers when they are retired in the 2020s—the Navy plans to substantially modify the design of the DDG-51 Flight IIA destroyer to create a Flight III configuration.
DOT&E stated that the proposed test approach for the AMDR and DDG 51 Flight III programs does not provide realistic operational conditions without the use of an AMDR- and Aegis-equipped unmanned self-defense test ship."

250,"At the same time conventional reactors are facing an uncertain future, some in Congress contend that more nuclear power plants, not fewer, are needed to help reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and bring low-carbon power to the majority of the world that currently has little access to electricity.
Titled the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017 (NEICA), the law requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to take several actions to support advanced reactor development, including studying the need for a versatile fast neutron test reactor that could help develop fuels and materials for advanced reactors.
NEICA lists a number of potential advantages of advanced nuclear reactors over conventional LWRs, including ""inherent safety features, lower waste yields, greater fuel utilization, superior reliability, resistance to proliferation, increased thermal efficiency, and the ability to integrate into electric and non-electric applications."" Advanced reactors encompass a wide range of technologies, including next-generation water-cooled reactors (e.g., small modular light water reactors, supercritical water-cooled reactors), non-water-cooled reactors (e.g., lead or sodium fast reactors, molten salt reactors, and high temperature gas reactors), and fusion reactors.
Advanced Reactor Technologies  Advanced or unconventional reactor designs seek to use combinations of new and existing technologies and materials to improve upon earlier generations of nuclear reactors in one or more of the following areas: cost, safety, security, waste management, and versatility.
Advanced reactor technologies are often referred to as ""Generation IV"" nuclear reactors, with existing commercial reactors constituting ""Generation III"" or, for the most recently constructed reactors, ""Generation III+."" Advanced reactor designs may be grouped into three primary categories:  Advanced water-cooled reactors , which provide evolutionary improvements to proven water-based fission technologies through innovations such as simplified design, smaller size, or enhanced efficiency; Non-water-cooled reactors , which are fission reactors that use materials such as liquid metals (e.g., sodium and lead), gases (e.g., helium and carbon dioxide), or molten salts as coolants instead of water; and Fusion reactors , which seek to generate energy by joining small atomic nuclei, as opposed to fission reactors, which generate energy by splitting large atomic nuclei.
DOE defines SMRs as reactors with electric generating capacities of no more than 300 MW, which ""employ modular construction techniques, ship major components from factory fabrication locations to the plant site by rail or truck, and include designs that simplify plant site activities required for plant assembly."" Both advanced water-cooled reactors and non-water-cooled reactors may be configured as SMRs. Microreactors are relatively small-capacity SMRs, defined by DOE as producing 1-20 megawatts of thermal energy (MWt), which could be used directly as heat for industrial processes or to generate electricity.
The United States maintained SFRs as a high priority focus of its nuclear R&D program (primarily due to the technology's plutonium breeding capabilities) up until the cancellation of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor demonstration plant in 1983 amid public opposition, rising construction costs, and increased concern over weapons proliferation.
Many advanced reactor developers contend their designs would improve upon the thermal efficiencies of older generations of nuclear plants by operating at higher temperatures or through use of more efficient power conversion technologies.
Of that, Congress directed $319.5 million (42%) to be used specifically for advanced nuclear technology R&D within the following programs and activities: S upercritical Transformational Electric Power R&D : $5 million appropriated to develop a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle for thermal-to-electric energy conversion in sodium-cooled fast reactors; Advanced Small Modular Reactor R&D : $100 million appropriated for this new, one-year subprogram that is to support ""cost-shared public-private R&D partnerships"" to address technical challenges and accelerate development of SMR reactor designs and supply chains; Advanced Reactor Technologies : $111.5 million appropriated to conduct early-stage R&D on advanced reactor technologies, including SMRs; Versatile Fast Test Reactor : $65 million appropriated for R&D to support development of a versatile fast test reactor, also called the versatile test reactor; Material Recovery and Waste Form Development : $38 million appropriated to activities related to ""the improvement of the current back end of the nuclear cycle [waste management and reprocessing],"" of which $27 million were specifically directed towards activities supporting advanced nuclear technologies.
For nuclear energy technology development, major stages include research on fuels and materials, development of reactor concepts and designs, component testing and evaluation, licensing by NRC, demonstration, and commercialization."
251,"Airborne EW as a DOD Priority One potential oversight issue for Congress is whether DOD is giving too little, too much, or the right amount of priority to airborne EW programs in its planning and budgeting relative to other U.S. military EW programs (such as those for U.S. ground forces or Navy surface ships) and to other DOD non-EW priorities, particularly in the context of renewed great power competition and improvements in air defense and EW capabilities by Russia, China, and other potential adversaries.
115-676 of May 15, 2018) on H.R. 5515 , the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act, stated that  [t]he committee supports the Air Force's efforts to recapitalize the aging EC–130H Compass Call fleet with the more capable EC–37 type aircraft.
McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, stated the following: The committee supports the Air Force's efforts to recapitalize the aging EC–130H Compass Call fleet with the EC–37 type aircraft."
252,"to insure the full development of these peaceful and defense uses without unnecessary delay,"" the Space Act granted NASA broad authority to ""enter into and perform such contracts, leases, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as may be necessary"" to accomplish its mission of research and exploration (emphasis added).
Potential Benefits Some of the potential benefits to OTs highlighted by analysts and officials include providing a mechanism to pool R&D resources with industry to facilitate development of, and obtain ""the latest state-of-the-art, dual use technologies""; attracting nontraditional contractors with promising technological capabilities to work with DOD; lowering costs by eliminating requirements associated with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (i.e., costs associated with required reporting and administrative activities) or sharing costs with industry; and ""speeding up"" the acquisition process.
By comparison, in the FY2018 NDAA, Congress expanded OT authorities and stated the following:  In the execution of science and technology and prototyping programs, the Secretary of Defense shall establish a preference, to be applied in circumstances determined appropriate by the Secretary, for using transactions other than contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants.
A number of analysts and industry officials have raised concerns that DOD could use OTs to avoid competitions, as OTs are exempt from the Competition in Contracting Act. According to statute, follow-on production using other transaction authority can only be awarded if the underlying R&D agreement was competed.
The conference report also stated that OTs are appropriate for those cases where the ""regulations applicable to the allocation of patent and data rights under the procurement statutes may not be appropriate to partnership arrangements in certain cases."" National Defense Authorization Act for FY1993 ( P.L. 102-484 )  Cost Sharing Section 4221 established 10 U.S.C. 2511, which required DOD to establish cooperative arrangements with industry, educational institutions, federal labs, and other entities, to pursue research, development, and application of dual-use technologies.
The section authorized DOD to use grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, or OTs to create these partnerships, and that the Federal government should not contribute more than 50% of the costs related to projects under this authority.
Nontraditional defense contractor was defined as an entity that for a period of one year has not entered into or performed ""any contract that is subject to full coverage under the cost accounting standards"" or ""any other contract in excess of $500,000 to carry out prototype projects or to perform basic, applied, or advanced research projects for a Federal agency, that is subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation.'' Section 803 also extended the authority to use OTs for prototypes from September 30, 2001, to September 30, 2004.
National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 ( P.L. 107-107 ) Expanded Authority—Follow-on Production Section 822 of the FY2002 NDAA granted DOD the authority to award a follow-on production contract for prototype projects when at least one-third of the total cost of the prototype project is to be paid out of funds provided by non-federal government sources.
(d) APPROPRIATE USE OF AUTHORITY.— (1) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that no official of an agency enters into a transaction (other than a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement) for a prototype project under the authority of this section unless one of the following conditions is met: (A) There is at least one nontraditional defense contractor or nonprofit research institution participating to a significant extent in the prototype project."
253,"The report noted that governments in the region remain beset by corruption and the effects of transnational organized crime and that ""persistent deficiencies in governance and the practice of democracy have given way to a declining confidence in government, in formal political institutions, and in democracy itself."" It also noted the return of populism to both Mexico and Brazil as disillusioned voters in both countries turned to populist candidates to ""stop the rot."" Economic Outlook Whereas the 1980s were commonly referred to as the lost decade of development because many countries were bogged down with unsustainable public debt, the 1990s brought about a shift from a strategy of import-substituting industrialization to one focused on export promotion, attraction of foreign capital, and privatization of state enterprises.
Over the past decade, the United States has engaged in close security cooperation with Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking and related violence.
(As noted below, Congress rejected the Administration's FY2018 request and funded foreign aid to the region at levels approaching assistance in FY2017; for FY2019, the 115 th Congress did not complete action on foreign aid appropriations, but bills in both houses would have continued to fund key U.S. initiatives in Colombia, Mexico, and Central America at levels approaching FY2017 levels.
See "" Congress and Policy Toward the Region "" and "" U.S. Foreign Aid ,"" below.) On trade issues, President Trump shifted the long-standing policy of past Administrations that focused on increasing economic linkages with Latin America through reciprocal free trade agreements.
(See "" Caribbean Region "" below.)  As the political and economic situation in Venezuela has continued to deteriorate, the Trump Administration has spoken out against the actions of the Maduro government and supported regional efforts to help resolve the situation.
The 115 th Congress rejected many of the Trump Administration's proposed cuts in foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean for FY2018 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), enacted in March 2018.
Regional Issues U.S. Foreign Aid The United States provides foreign assistance to the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean to support development and other U.S. objectives.
(Also see "" Colombia "" section below.) U.S. support to combat drug trafficking and reduce crime also has included a series of partnerships with other countries in the region: the Mérida Initiative, which has led to improved bilateral security cooperation with Mexico; the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI); and the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).
Congressional Action: The 115 th Congress held hearings on opioids, which included consideration of heroin and fentanyl production in Mexico, Colombia's peace process and how it relates to drug policy, criminal groups in the Western Hemisphere, and Mexican transnational criminal organizations and border security.
Economic relations between the United States and most of its trading partners in the region remain strong, despite challenges, such as the renegotiation of NAFTA and President Trump's repeated threats to withdraw from the agreement, and diplomatic tensions and high levels of violence in some countries in the region.
The United States strengthened economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean over the past 24 years through the negotiation and implementation of FTAs. Starting with NAFTA in 1994, the United States currently has six FTAs in force involving 11 Latin American countries: Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru.
Migration Issues Latin America's status as a leading source of both legal and unauthorized migration to the United States means that U.S. immigration policies significantly affect countries in the region and U.S. relations with their governments.
These include the Administration's actions to increase immigration enforcement; end TPS designations for Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras; rescind DACA; criminally prosecute migrants who unlawfully enter the United States; and alter U.S. asylum policy.

McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), P.L. 115-232 , signed into law in August 2018, contains a provision in Section 1287 requiring a report on drug trafficking and corruption in Central America's northern triangle countries, including identifying government officials and other individuals involved in such activities.
Accordingly, the Obama Administration launched a new, whole-of-government U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America and requested a significant increase in foreign assistance for the region to support the strategy's implementation."
254,"The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995 and the rules and agreements that resulted from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994).
With growing debate over the role and future direction of the WTO, a number of issues may be of interest to Congress, including the value of U.S. membership and leadership in the WTO, whether new U.S. negotiating objectives or oversight hearings are needed to address prospects for new WTO reforms and rulemaking, and the relevant authorities and the impact of potential WTO withdrawal on U.S. economic and foreign policy interests.
The core principles and articles of the GATT (which were carried over to the WTO) committed the original 23 members, including the United States, to lower tariffs on a range of industrial goods and to apply tariffs in a nondiscriminatory manner—the so-called most-favored nation or MFN principle (see text box ).
A key issue in the Doha Round for the United States was lowering major developing countries' relatively high bound tariffs to below their applied rates in practice to achieve commercially meaningful new market access.
The legislation contained general provisions on  approval and entry into force of the Uruguay Round Agreements, and the relationship of the agreements to U.S. laws (Section 101 of the act); authorities to implement the results of current and future tariff negotiations (Section 111 of the act); oversight of activities of the WTO (Sections 121-130 of the act); procedures regarding implementation of dispute settlement proceedings affecting the United States (Section 123 of the act); objectives regarding extended Uruguay Round negotiations; statutory modifications to implement specific agreements, including the following: Antidumping Agreement; Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM); Safeguards Agreement; Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA); Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) (product standards); Agreement on Agriculture; and Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
For example, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 specifically contained provisions directing U.S. negotiators to negotiate disciplines on agriculture, dispute settlement, intellectual property, trade in services, and safeguards, among others, that resulted in WTO agreements in the Uruguay Round (see text box above).
WTO Agreements The WTO member-led body negotiates, administers, and settles disputes for agreements that cover goods, agriculture, services, certain trade-related investment measures, and intellectual property rights, among other issues.
The GATT/WTO system of agreements has expanded rulemaking to several areas of international trade, but does not extensively cover some key areas, including multilateral investment rules, trade-related labor or environment issues, and emerging issues like digital trade or the commercial role of state-owned enterprises.
While TRIMS and other WTO agreements, such as the GATS (see below), include some provisions pertaining to investment, the lack of comprehensive multilateral rules on investment led to several efforts under the Doha Round to consider proposals, which to date have been unfruitful (see "" Future Negotiations "").
Given the lack of progress, in 2013, 23 WTO members, including the United States, representing approximately 70% of global services trade, launched negotiations of a services-specific plurilateral agreement.
Several concerns were also raised, including ""the preponderant role of the State in general, and of state-owned enterprises in particular,"" and ""China's support and subsidy policies and local content requirements, including those that may be part of the 2025 [Made in China] plan.""  Plurilateral Agreements (Annex 4) Most WTO agreements in force have been negotiated on a multilateral basis, meaning the entire body of WTO members subscribes to them.
In December 2015, a group of 51 WTO members, including the United States, negotiated an expanded agreement to cover an additional 201 products and technologies, valued at over $1 trillion in annual global exports.
Unfortunately, the World Trade Organization is not equipped to deal with this problem."" USTR views efforts to resolve concerns over Chinese trade practices to date as limited in effectiveness, including through WTO dispute settlement, as well as recent proposals by WTO members to craft new rules and WTO reforms.
Members have made some progress in recent years, reaching the Trade Facilitation Agreement in 2013, followed by a small package of deals in 2015 concerning agriculture and rules for LDCs. Still, they remain sharply divided over how to prioritize both unresolved and new issues on the agenda, and, more fundamentally, how to conduct negotiations to better facilitate successful outcomes.
The United States with other countries recently issued new proposals to address these concerns—see "" Transparency/Notification ."" Fisheries Subsidies As noted above, WTO members committed to negotiate disciplines related to fisheries subsidies at the 11 th Ministerial with a view toward reaching an agreement by 2020."
255,"(See "" Targeted Sanctions Related to Antidemocratic Actions, Human Rights Violations, and Corruption ,"" below.) On December 17, 2018, a group of investors demanded the Venezuelan government pay off the interest and principal of a defaulted $1.5 billion bond, the first step in a potential legal process by creditors to recover their assets.
Whereas populist President Hugo Chávez (1998-2013) governed during a period of generally high oil prices, his successor, Nicolás Maduro of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), has exacerbated an economic downturn caused by low global oil prices through mismanagement and corruption.
In early January, Christian Zerpa, a former ally of Maduro on the Supreme Court, fled the country to seek asylum in the United States; he maintains that the May election ""was not free and competitive."" Under the leadership of Juan Guaidó, a 35-year old industrial engineer from the VP party who was elected president of the National Assembly on January 5, 2019, the opposition has been reenergized.
It then criticized state limits on social protests and freedom of expression and said that the government ""must curtail the use of force against demonstrators."" In March 2018, the State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2017 found that ""human rights deteriorated dramatically"" in 2017 as the government tried hundreds of civilians in military courts and arrested 12 opposition mayors for their ""alleged failure to control protests."" In May 2018, an independent panel of human rights experts added a legal assessment to a report containing information and witness testimonies gathered by the OAS recommending that the International Criminal Court (ICC) should investigate credible reports that the Venezuelan government committed crimes against humanity.
On September 26, 2018, the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on Venezuela expressing ""its deepest concern"" about the serious human rights violations described in the June 2018 report, calling upon the Venezuelan government to accept humanitarian assistance and requiring a UNOCHR investigation on the situation in Venezuela to be presented in 2019.
In addition to the UNOCHR, former Venezuelan officials, the OAS, and neighboring countries have asked the ICC to investigate serious human rights violations committed by the Maduro government; the ICC prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation in February 2018.
Unlike under Chávez, an increasing number of countries have criticized authoritarian actions taken by the Maduro government, brought concerns about Venezuela to regional and global organizations, and implemented targeted sanctions against its officials.
In December 2016, the South American Common Market (Mercosur) trade bloc suspended Venezuela over concerns that its government had violated the requirement that Mercosur's members have ""fully functioning democratic institutions."" Six UNASUR members—Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay—issued a joint statement opposing the Venezuelan Supreme Court's attempted power grab in March 2017.
In the wake of the May 2018 elections that the United States and much of the international community deemed illegitimate, the Trump Administration has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro government in order to hasten a return to democracy in Venezuela.
The Administration has ratcheted up targeted sanctions on Venezuelan officials accused of corruption, antidemocratic actions, or human rights abuses under Executive Order (E.O.) 13692 (issued by President Obama in 2015) and on Venezuela-linked individuals and entities for drug trafficking.
Following President Maduro's second inauguration, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo pledged to ""use the full weight of U.S. economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy."" National Security Adviser John Bolton lent support to National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó's decision ""to invoke protections under Venezuela's constitution and declare that Maduro does not legitimately hold the country's presidency."" Vice President Pence has also lent his support to Guaidó.
The E.O. authorized targeted sanctions against (1) those involved in actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions; (2) those involved in significant acts of violence or conduct constituting a serious abuse or violation of human rights; (3) those involved in actions that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or peaceful assembly; or (4) those senior Venezuelan officials involved in public corruption."
256,"Part B The Coal Act established Part B of the federal Black Lung Program to provide cash benefits to miners totally disabled due to CWP and to the survivors of miners who die from CWP.
However, pursuant to the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 ( P.L. 95-227 ), these benefits are now paid from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund established by this law and primarily financed by an excise tax on coal.
The trust fund is also used for the following federal Black Lung Program-related expenses: the payment of benefits for miners whose last coal mine employment was before January 1, 1970; reimbursement to the Treasury for the costs of Part C benefits paid from general revenue before April 1, 1978, for periods of benefit eligibility after January 1, 1974; the repayment and payment of interest on advances made from the general fund to the trust fund; the payment of administrative expenses related to Part C of the BLBA and the coal excise tax incurred after March 1, 1978; and the reimbursement of coal operators who paid Part C benefits before April 1, 1978, for miners whose last coal mine employment ended before January 1, 1970.
The BLBA defines pneumoconiosis for the purposes of benefit eligibility as ""a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment."" The BLBA directs the Secretary of Labor to develop, through regulations, standards for determining if a miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or died due to pneumoconiosis.
When extending the increased rates, Congress reiterated the original intent of establishing trust fund financing for black lung benefits, observing that it is ""to reduce reliance on the Treasury and to recover costs from the mining industry."" It was also observed that the program's expenses had continued to exceed revenues over time, and that the debt to the Treasury was not likely to be paid off by 2013."
257,"How Programs Address Capability Gaps In its current configuration, Army officials note that IBCTs ""can get there fast with low logistics demand, and they can work in severely restricted terrain, but they lack mobility and protected firepower"" to ""enter a foreign territory, immediately overcome armed opposition and hold an area that enables further troops to enter, like an airfield.""  The Army's concept of operation for these vehicles is to increase ground tactical mobility in the IBCT; allow infantry squads and rifle companies to quickly move extended distances over difficult terrain to seize assault objectives; allow rapid deployment into contested areas while providing high mobility and flexibility upon arrival; and limit the impact on strategic mobility of the IBCT.
In this regard, the GMV/ISV is intended to provide mobility to the rifle squad and company; the LRV to provide protection to the moving force by means of scouts, sensors, and a variety of medium-caliber weapons; and the MPF to provide the overall IBCT the capability to more effectively engage and destroy fortifications, bunkers, buildings, and light to medium armored vehicles.
In the first phase, the Army planned to procure GMVs for the five Airborne IBCTs through a U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) contract already in place for a similar vehicle (GMV 1.1) for USSOCOM forces."
258,"Furthermore, program eligibility requirements and payment limits generate considerable congressional interest because their effects differ across regions and by type of commodities produced and because a substantial amount of annual U.S. farm program payments are at stake: Direct federal outlays have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017.
Background Farm program payment limits and eligibility requirements may differ by both type of program and type of participating legal entity (e.g., an individual, a partnership, or a corporation).
In recent years, congressional debate has focused on attributing payments directly to individual recipients, ensuring that payments go to persons or entities currently engaged in farming, capping the amount of payments that a qualifying recipient may receive in any one year, and excluding farmers or farming entities with incomes above a certain level as measured by their AGI from payment eligibility.
Critical changes to a farming operation might include expanding the number of limitations for payment, such as by adding a new family member, changing the land rental status from cash to share basis, purchasing additional base acres equivalent to at least 20% of the previous base, or substantially altering the interest share of capital or equipment contributed to the farm operation.
AGI Limit Means testing prohibits persons or legal entities from being eligible to receive any benefit under certain commodity and conservation programs during a crop, fiscal, or program year, as appropriate, if their income is above an established level.
Payment Limits When the eligibility criteria—including AEF, AGI, conservation compliance, and others—are met, the cumulative benefits across certain farm programs are subject to specific annual payment limits (detailed in Table 1 ) that can be received by an individual or legal entity in a year."
259,"Supporters of the liberal international order generally argue that in return for bearing the costs of creating and sustaining the liberal international order, the United States receives significant security, political, and economic benefits, including the maintenance of a favorable balance of power on both a global and regional level, and a leading or dominant role in establishing and operating global institutions and rules for international finance and trade.
Although views among these observers vary in their specifics, a number of these observers argue that under the Trump Administration, the United States is voluntarily retreating from or abdicating the United States' post-World War II position of global leadership in favor of an approach to U.S. foreign policy that is more restrained, less engaged (or disengaged), more unilateralist, less willing to work through international or multilateral institutions and agreements, and/or less willing to promote and defend certain universal values.
Within that general assessment, these observers argue that the United States more specifically is doing one or more of the following: becoming more skeptical of the value to the United States of certain allies, particularly those in Europe, and more transactional in managing U.S. alliance relationships; becoming less supportive of regional or multilateral trade agreements and the World Trade Organization (WTO) in favor of an approach to trade policy that relies more on protectionist measures and on negotiations aimed at reaching new or revised bilateral trade agreements, and which links trade actions more directly to other policy objectives; reducing, becoming more selective in, or becoming indifferent to efforts for defending and promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights as universal values, and for criticizing and resisting authoritarian and illiberal forms of government; and relying less on soft power, and more heavily on hard power, particularly military power.
In support of this assessment, these observers tend to cite various actions by the Trump Administration, including the following: the Administration's emphasis on its ""America First"" theme and the concept of national sovereignty applied to both the United States and other countries as primary guideposts for U.S. foreign policy; actions (particularly in 2017) that these observers view as intended to weaken or ""hollow out"" the State Department—including a relatively slow rate for forwarding nominations to fill senior positions in the department, and budget proposals to substantially reduce overall staffing and funding levels for the department—as well as proposed reductions in funding for U.S. foreign assistance programs; U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) regional trade agreement; the Paris climate agreement; the Iran nuclear agreement; and the Global Compact on Migration (GCM); a U.S. decision to not cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC); and a U.S. decision to limit U.S. exposure to decisions by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) by withdrawing from the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations; mixed signals, including skeptical or critical comments by President Trump, regarding the value to the United States of allies, and particularly the NATO alliance, and a reported focus by President Trump, in assessing allies, on their defense spending levels and their trade imbalances with the United States; an apparent reluctance by President Trump to criticize Russia or to impose certain sanctions on Russia, and an apparent determination by President Trump to seek improved relations with Russia, despite various Russian actions judged by U.S. intelligence agencies and other observers to have been directed against the United States and U.S. overseas interests, particularly in Europe; a reduced U.S. level of involvement in, or U.S. disengagement from, the conflict in Syria, and U.S. acceptance of a reestablished Russian position as a major power broker in the Syrian situation and the Middle East in general; the nonattendance by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at the rollout of the 2017 edition of the State Department's annual country reports on human rights practices around the world; infrequent or inconsistent statements by President Trump or other Administration officials in support of democracy and human rights, or criticizing human rights practices of authoritarian and illiberal governments; U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations Human Rights Council; U.S. actions to reduce the number of international refugees entering the United States; President Trump's reaction to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi; and what these observers view as President Trump's apparent affinity for, or admiration of, the leaders of authoritarian and illiberal governments.
Opponents argue that actions contributing to the U.S. retreat are weakening the United States and the U.S. position in the world by rupturing long-standing and valuable U.S. alliance relationships; isolating the United States on certain issues; devaluing or reducing U.S. soft power; making the United States appear less reliable as an ally or negotiating partner; creating vacuums in global leadership and regional power balances that other countries (including China, Russia, the European Union, individual European countries, Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran) are acting to fill, sometimes at the expense of U.S. interests; and weakening and causing doubts about the future of the U.S.-led international order.
Supporters argue that actions being implemented by the Trump Administration reflect a principled realism about what the United States can accomplish in the world; are reasserting the importance of U.S. sovereignty (and the concept of sovereignty in general as an organizing principle for international relations); are proving effective in standing up for U.S. interests in relations with China, as well as U.S. trade interests in general (including new trade agreements with South Korea, Mexico, and Canada); encouraging U.S. allies to make greater military and other contributions to their own security; enhancing deterrence of potential regional aggression by making potential U.S. actions less predictable to potential adversaries; avoiding potentially costly and unproductive commitments of U.S. lives and resources in places like Syria and Yemen; and are achieving progress or potential breakthroughs in terms of denuclearization negotiations with North Korea.
In support of this assessment, these supporters cite various actions by the Trump Administration, including the following: the Administration's December 2017 national security strategy (NSS) document, large portions of which reflect—through multiple mentions of U.S. leadership, a general emphasis on great power competition with China and Russia, and strong support for U.S. alliances—a perspective on the U.S. role in the world generally consistent with the U.S. role of the past 70 years, as well as actions the Trump Administration has taken in support of that perspective; the Administration's January 2018 unclassified summary of its supporting national defense strategy (NDS) document, which similarly reflects a perspective on the U.S. role in the world generally consistent with the U.S. role of the past 70 years; the Administration's October 2018 counterterrorism strategy document, which observers view as largely consistent with the counterterrorism strategies of previous administrations; the continuation (as opposed to winding down) of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's statement that he wants the State Department to ""get its swagger back""; statements from senior U.S. officials reaffirming U.S. support for NATO; Administration actions to improve U.S. military capabilities in Europe for deterring potential Russian aggression in Europe; and U.S. actions to encourage NATO allies to spend more on defense and to take similar actions; the Administration's implementation of additional sanctions on Russia in response to Russian actions; the Administration's recent, more-confrontational policy toward China, and the Administration's plan to increase funding for U.S. foreign assistance programs to compete against China for influence in Africa, Asia, and the Americas; the Administration's articulation of the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) region as a framework for U.S. foreign policy directed toward that part of the world; U.S. trade actions that, in the view of these observers, are intended to make free trade more sustainable over the long run by ensuring that it is fair to all parties, including the United States; and statements regarding human rights from then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and other Administration officials, as well as the U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations Human Rights Council, which in the view of these observers reflect U.S. support (rather than lack of support) for human rights.
In public opinion polls, Americans often express support for a more-restrained U.S. role, particularly on issues such as whether the United States should act as the world's police force, funding levels for U.S. foreign assistance programs, U.S. participation in (and financial support for) international organizations, and U.S. defense expenditures for defending allies.
Supporters of the current U.S. approach to allies and alliances, while acknowledging the free-rider issue as something that needs to be managed, generally argue that alliances are needed and valuable for deterring potential regional aggressors and balancing against would-be potential hegemonic powers in Eurasia; that although allies might be capable of defending themselves without U.S. help, they might also choose, in the absence of U.S. help, to bandwagon with would-be regional hegemons (rather than contribute to efforts to balance against them); that alliances form a significant advantage for the United States in its dealings with other major powers, such as Russia and China (both of which largely lack similar alliance networks); that in addition to mutual defense benefits, alliances offer other benefits, particularly in peacetime, including sharing of intelligence, information, and technology and the cultivation of soft-power forms of cooperation; and that a transactional approach to alliances, which encourages the merits of each bilateral alliance relationship to be measured in isolation, overlooks the collective benefits of maintaining alliances with multiple countries in a region.
At least one has argued that the American people ""always have been the greatest constraint on America's role in the world."" One issue relating to U.S. public opinion that observers are discussing is the extent to which the U.S. public may now believe that U.S. leaders have broken a tacit social contract under which the U.S. public has supported the costs of U.S. global leadership in return for the promise of receiving certain benefits, particularly steady increases in real incomes and the standard of living.
Another issue for Congress—one that might be viewed as related to, or forming part of, the previous issue—is whether a change of some kind in the U.S. role, whether desirable or not, is unavoidable due to factors such as the growth in recent decades in the wealth and power of China and other countries, and the effect this has on reducing the U.S. position of dominance in world affairs; constraints on U.S. resources, particularly given projected U.S. budget deficits and debt and competing domestic priorities; the gradual fading over time of collective memory of the major wars and widespread economic disruption and deprivation of the first half of the 20th century, and of how the U.S. role in the world of the last 70 years has been motivated at bottom by a desire to prevent a repetition of the events of that earlier era; and other factors, such as technological developments, that can change power dynamics among nations, influence international financial and economic flows and globalization in general, affect social cohesion and relationships between governments and the governed, affect the development and spread of political beliefs and ideologies, and empower nonstate organizations and individuals in ways not previously possible.
China The question of how China may be responding to a possibly changed U.S. role is of particular potential significance because while certain countries, such as Russia, are viewed by some observers as wanting to erode or tear down the liberal international order, China is the only country (other than the United States) that is generally viewed as being potentially capable of acting on its own to build a successor world order.
Some observers believe that China has concluded, correctly or not, that the United States is retreating from or abandoning its role as global leader, and that China is responding to this assessment by expanding or accelerating its efforts to increase its economic and political role on the world stage, in part through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); separate the United States from its allies and raise doubts about the reliability of the United States as an ally or partner; work more closely with Russia with the aim of reducing U.S. influence in Eurasia; revise the liberal international order in ways that are conducive to Chinese values and interests; and perhaps eventually supplant the United States in the role of world leader.
Other observers perceive that some in China, viewing certain actions by the Trump Administration—including the Administration's ""trade war"" with China, the Administration's articulation of the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific, and actions aimed at countering China's growing control over the South China Sea—have concluded that the United States is seeking to contain China in a manner broadly consistent with how the United States pursued a policy of containment against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Still others argue that the Administration's trade actions are leading to closer relations between China and other countries (including U.S. allies in Europe) that do not support certain U.S. trade-related actions.
Russia Some observers believe that Russia, like China, has concluded, correctly or not, that the United States is retreating from or abandoning its role as global leader, and that Russia is responding to this assessment by continuing efforts aimed at establishing greater Russian influence over or control of countries on its periphery, and more generally, reestablishing Russia as a major world power; separating the United States from transatlantic allies and weakening the NATO alliance; working more closely with China with the aim of reducing U.S. influence in Eurasia; and raising doubts about the merits of liberal democracy while promoting illiberal and authoritarian approaches to government in Europe and elsewhere.
They argue that U.S. policymakers should pay attention to how U.S. actions could have the effect of encouraging or strengthening such Sino-Russian strategic cooperation, given the combined economic resources, military capabilities, and informational capabilities of China and Russia, and their common goals of separating the United States from its allies, reducing U.S. influence in Eurasia, and raising doubts about the merits of liberal democracy while promoting illiberal and authoritarian approaches to government.
As former US defense secretary James Mattis put it in his resignation letter, ""While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies."" Trump has refused to advocate for America's democratic values, and he seems to encourage the forces that oppose them.
U.S. Allies and Current or Emerging Partner Countries Overview Given the significant role of alliances and partner relationships in U.S. foreign policy and defense strategy, reactions by U.S. allies and current or emerging partner countries to a possible change in the U.S. role in the world could have major implications for U.S. national security.
For observers who assess that the United States has shifted to a more-restrained U.S. role in the world, the situation provides a test—although not one with precisely the features they might have designed—of a question long argued by strategists, political scientists, and others involved in the debate over the merits of the U.S. role in the world of the past 70 years: Would U.S. allies and partner countries respond to a more-restrained U.S. role by taking stronger actions on their own to balance against potential regional hegemons in Eurasia (i.e., China and Russia), or would they instead respond by bandwagoning with those potential regional hegemons?
Europe (Other Than Russia) and Canada The transatlantic alliance—the alliance of the United States and Canada with the United Kingdom and other European countries, particularly under the NATO treaty—is generally viewed as a bedrock of post-World War II U.S. national security strategy and a key supporting element of the U.S. role in the world since World War II.
Supporters of continuing the U.S. role in the world of the past 70 years, on the other hand, might argue that the Philippines under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has adopted a largely nonconfrontational policy toward China regarding China's actions in the South China Sea, that the ASEAN countries as a group are split on the question of how much to confront China regarding China's actions in the South China Sea, that the question of policy toward China has been a matter of debate in Australia, and that there may be limits to how far and how fast India is willing to go in terms of increasing its efforts to counter China and cooperate with the United States, Japan, and Australia in countering China.
Some of the strategies that foreign actors are pursuing do have potential benefits for the United States, particularly insofar as they lead to greater and perhaps more equitable efforts to sustain the post-World War II international order.
From a congressional perspective, questions in this debate in recent years have included whether Congress over the years has ceded too much authority to the executive branch in the area of war powers—and what the meaning of the war powers function might be in today's world, given ongoing counterterrorist operations, so-called hybrid warfare and gray-zone operations, and cyberwarfare; whether Congress should consider legislation that would limit the President's authority to withdraw the United States from NATO without two-thirds consent of the Senate; whether Congress over the years has ceded too much authority to the executive branch in the area of tariffs and trade negotiations; whether the executive branch is following congressional direction for spending funds and implementing programs bearing on U.S. foreign policy; and whether the executive branch is keeping Congress adequately informed regarding U.S. diplomacy with other countries and U.S. government operations in other countries bearing on the U.S. role in the world, including those carried out by U.S. intelligence agencies or U.S. special operations forces.
Lawmakers during the post-World War II era assumed presidents of both parties agreed on certain broad lessons of prewar history, such as the need to remain widely engaged through trade and collective security, and the importance of humanitarian values—""soft power""—in U.S. foreign policy.
Congressional decisions on issues relating to the U.S. role in the world could include measures affecting areas such as war powers, tariffs and trade negotiations, use of appropriated funds for foreign policy-related programs, and executive branch actions to keep Congress informed of U.S. government operations in other countries.
Grand strategy The term grand strategy generally refers in foreign policy discussions to a country's overall approach for securing its interests and making its way in the world, using all the national instruments at its disposal, including diplomatic, informational, military, and economic tools (sometimes abbreviated in U.S. government parlance as DIME).
As discussed in another CRS report, observers have concluded that in recent years, there has been a shift from the post-Cold War era to a new international security situation characterized by renewed great power competition between the United States, China, and Russia, leading observers to refer to the new situation as a tripolar or multipolar world.

While the Trump administration has taken action along this path—unilaterally withdrawing from the Paris and Iran agreements, pulling the United States out from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, and questioning the value of long-time alliances like NATO—the majority of the American public has not followed this lead.
The past two years have given the American public a glimpse of President Trump's alternative vision for the role of the United States in the world.
2017 Chicago Council on Global Affairs Report A 2017 Chicago Council on Global Affairs report on U.S. public opinion data regarding the Trump Administration's theme of America First stated President Trump's inaugural address, like his campaign, signaled a major departure from the past seven decades of American foreign policy and engagement with the rest of the world."
260,"Under these circumstances, the Court held that ""the corporation's property interests"" did not ""settle the question"" : ""[w]hether a corporation or a municipality owns or possesses the town[,] the public in either case has an identical interest in the functioning of the community in such manner that the channels of communication remain free."" Consequently, the corporation could not be permitted ""to govern a community of citizens"" in a way that ""restrict[ed] their fundamental liberties."" The Supreme Court has described Marsh as embodying a ""public function"" test, under which the First Amendment will apply if a private entity exercises ""powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the State."" Since Marsh was issued in 1946, however, it has largely been limited to the facts presented in that case.
NLRB , rejecting the idea that ""large self-contained shopping center[s]"" are ""the functional equivalent of a municipality."" Instead, the Court held that in Hudgens , where a shopping center manager had threatened to arrest picketers for trespassing, ""the constitutional guarantee of free expression ha[d] no part to play."" As a result, the picketers ""did not have a First Amendment right to enter this shopping center for the purpose of advertising their strike."" In another decision in which the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment did not prevent a shopping center from banning the distribution of handbills, the Court distinguished Marsh by noting that ""the owner of the company town was performing the full spectrum of municipal powers and stood in the shoes of the State."" By contrast, the disputed shopping center had not assumed ""municipal functions or power."" The fact that the shopping center was generally open to the public did not qualify as a ""dedication of [the] privately owned and operated shopping center to public use"" sufficient ""to entitle respondents to exercise therein the asserted First Amendment rights.""  Apart from the factual circumstances presented by the company town that exercises powers ""traditionally"" and ""exclusively"" held by the government, the Court has sometimes applied the First Amendment against private parties if they have a ""sufficiently close relationship"" to the government.
Instead, the inquiry in such a case is ""whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself."" In a 2001 case, the Supreme Court held that a state athletic association, while ""nominally private,"" should be subject to First Amendment standards because of ""the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings."" Some plaintiffs have argued that various internet companies, including some social media sites, should be treated as state actors subject to the First Amendment when those companies take down or restrict access to their speech.
And Section 230(c)(2) provides immunity for sites that take good faith action to restrict access to content that the provider or users deem ""objectionable."" Consequently, to the extent that private litigants or state governments would have been able to hold social media companies liable under existing law for their decisions regarding presenting or restricting access to user content, those suits have largely been barred under Section 230.
The Court noted that unlike the broadcast industry, ""the vast democratic fora of the Internet"" had not traditionally ""been subject to the type of government supervision and regulation that has attended the broadcast industry,"" and said that ""the Internet is not as 'invasive' as radio or television."" Accordingly, the Court stated that there was ""no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium."" However, as will be discussed in more detail below, some scholars have argued that Reno , decided in 1997, does not specifically address government regulation of modern social media sites, which may present unique concerns from those discussed in Reno .
This relative dearth of cases is likely due in large part to the fact that, as discussed above, Section 230 of the CDA bars a significant number of lawsuits that seek to hold social media providers liable for publishing others' content, often making it unnecessary to consider whether the First Amendment protects these publication decisions."
261,"The FY2008 NDAA ( P.L. 110-181 ) expanded concurrent receipt eligibility to include those who are 100% disabled due to unemployability and provided CRSC to those who were medically retired or retired prematurely due to force reduction programs prior to completing 20 years of service.
CRSC for Military Disability (Chapter 61) and TERA Retirees Servicemembers with a permanent DOD disability rating of 30% or greater may be retired and receive retired pay prior to completing 20 years of service."
262,"The practice of international trophy hunting, especially of rare and endangered species, has generated controversy for a number of reasons, including its relation to conservation (including of wildlife populations), ethical considerations, and its effect on local economies where the animals are hunted.
Further, they argue that trophy hunting can create incentives for conserving habitat and ecosystems where hunted animals roam and, in some impoverished areas in range countries, can provide a means of income, employment, and community development.
For example, limited data may misrepresent the number of trophies harvested or animals killed, corruption can blur the route of money from hunters to conservation efforts, and a lack of information on conservation plans and practices associated with domestic laws and regulations can lead to questions about the effectiveness of these conservation efforts.
However, Congress can address the import of wildlife trophies into the United States and can use laws and regulations to indirectly influence trophy-hunting practices in range countries.
In addition, some Trump Administration policies have stimulated congressional interest in trophy hunting, such as one to evaluate permits issued for importing sport-hunted trophies of listed animals into the United States on a case-by-case basis, a change from the previous practice of evaluating the range country before issuing permits for hunting these animals.
For example, a hunter attempting to import a trophy of an animal listed under CITES Appendix I (the most protective category) into the United States would be required to obtain an import and export permit (from the importing country and range country, respectively) for the wildlife or wildlife parts.
Trophy imports of CITES-listed species under Appendixes I and II generally are administered through a quota system established by the range country (or in some cases the CITES Secretariat), and they require a determination that the killing of the animal causes no detriment to the population, referred to as a n on- d etriment f inding (NDF)."
263,"As the Supreme Court recognized, the ""traditional right to freedom before conviction permits the unhampered preparation of a defense and prevents inflicting punishment prior to conviction."" But the Supreme Court has never recognized a right to bail as absolute, and has held that the government may have legitimate interests in limiting the availability of bail, even for noncapital crimes, based not only on possible flight risk but also on other considerations, including the danger an arrestee poses to public safety or specific members of the community.
Federal law also expressly provides that a ""judicial officer may not impose a financial condition that results in the pretrial detention of the person."" Critics of state and local money-bail systems assert, among other things, that fee schedules unduly burden indigent defendants, who face more difficulty paying bail—including relatively low bail fees associated with misdemeanor offenses—than nonindigent defendants accused of similar offenses."
264,"Congress authorized a Department of Defense-led train and equip program to combat terrorist groups active in Syria, defend the United States and its partners from Syria-based terrorist threats, and ""promote the conditions for a negotiated settlement to end the conflict in Syria.""  In September 2014, the United States began air strikes in Syria, with the stated goal of preventing the Islamic State from using Syria as a base for its operations in neighboring Iraq.
In October 2014, the Defense Department established Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) to ""formalize ongoing military actions against the rising threat posed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria."" CJTF-OIR came to encompass more than 70 countries, and has bolstered the efforts of local Syrian partner forces against the Islamic State.
The U.S. intelligence community's 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment stated in February 2018 that, ""The conflict has decisively shifted in the Syrian regime's favor, enabling Russia and Iran to further entrench themselves inside the country."" At the same time, ongoing conflict between the coalition's Syrian Kurdish partners and Turkey has continued to challenge U.S. policymakers, as has the entrenchment of Al Qaeda-affiliated groups among the opposition and the ongoing humanitarian crisis.
Amid significant territorial losses by the Islamic State and Syrian opposition groups since 2015 and parallel military gains by the Syrian government and coalition partner forces, U.S. policymakers face a number of questions and potential decision points related to the following factors: Counter-IS operations and the presence of U.S. military personnel in Syria  The announcement by President Trump in December 2018 that U.S. forces would withdraw from Syria was welcomed by the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian partners, along with observers who questioned the necessity, utility, and legality of continued U.S. operations.
A Lead Inspector General report on Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) released in February 2019 states that, ""absent sustained [counterterrorism] pressure, ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to twelve months and regain limited territory in the [Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV)].""  The future of the Syria Train and Equip program The Islamic State has lost the territory it once held in Syria, and much of that territory is now controlled by local forces that have received U.S. training and assistance since 2014.
The future of U.S.-administered stabilization and other assistance programs in formerly opposition-held areas of Syria and areas currently held by U.S. partner forces is in question, in light of both the Asad government's reassertion of control in many areas, the planned reduction of U.S. military forces, and the December 2018 withdrawal of State Department and USAID personnel from northern Syria.
The most recent Lead Inspector General report on Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) states that, ""absent sustained [counterterrorism] pressure, ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to twelve months and regain limited territory in the [Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV)]."" Prior to the Administration's withdrawal announcement in December 2018, U.S. officials had stated that once the conventional fight against the Islamic State was completed, the coalition would shift to a ""new phase"" focused on stabilization, including the training of local forces to hold liberated areas.
Among the objectives identified by successive Administrations and by many Members in successive sessions of Congress have been supporting Syrian-led efforts to demand more representative, accountable, and effective governance; seeking a negotiated settlement that includes a transition in Syria away from the leadership of Bashar al Asad and his supporters; limiting or preventing the use of military force by state and nonstate actors against civilian populations; mitigating transnational threats posed by Syria-based Islamist extremist groups; meeting the humanitarian needs of internally and externally displaced Syrians; preventing the presence and needs of Syrian refugees from destabilizing neighboring countries; limiting the negative effects of other third party interventions on regional and international balances of power; and responding to and preventing the use of chemical weapons.
This has, over time, included debates regarding the potential imposition of no-fly zones over areas of the country to protect civilians, operations against various extremist groups, force protection for U.S. military personnel and partner forces inside Syria, and strikes against Syrian chemical weapons facilities and related forces."
265,"Introduction This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, which is carried out by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Navy, and gives Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers a capability for conducting BMD operations.
With the advent of the Aegis BMD system's new SM-3 Block IIA interceptor (which is discussed further in the next section), DOD is now evaluating the potential for the Aegis BMD system to intercept certain ICBMs. Section 1680 of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 2810 / P.L. 115-91 of December 12, 2017) directed DOD to ""conduct a test to evaluate and demonstrate, if technologically feasible, the capability to defeat a simple intercontinental ballistic missile threat using the standard missile 3 block IIA missile interceptor.""  DOD's January 2019 missile defense review report states the following: The SM-3 Blk IIA interceptor is intended as part of the regional missile defense architecture, but also has the potential to provide an important ""underlay"" to existing GBIs [ground-based interceptors] for added protection against ICBM threats to the homeland.
A March 18, 2019, press report states: The Pentagon plans a ""first-of-its-kind"" test of an unprecedented weapons capability to intercept and destroy an enemy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile ""ICBM"" -- from a Navy ship at sea using a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA.
EPAA calls for using BMD-capable Aegis ships, a land-based radar in Europe, and two Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland to defend Europe against ballistic missile threats from countries such as Iran."
266,"Title III of the FY2001 agriculture appropriations bill ( P.L. 106-387 ) directed USDA/RUS to conduct a ""pilot program to finance broadband transmission and local dial-up Internet service in areas that meet the definition of 'rural area' used for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program."" Subsequently, on December 5, 2000, RUS announced the availability of $100 million in loan funding through a one-year pilot program ""to finance the construction and installation of broadband telecommunications services in rural America."" The broadband pilot loan program was authorized under the authority of the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program (7 U.S.C. 950aaa), and was available to ""legally organized entities"" not located within the boundaries of a city or town having a population in excess of 20,000.
Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program Building on the pilot broadband loan program at RUS, Section 6103 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-171 ) amended the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to authorize a loan and loan guarantee program to provide funds for the costs of the construction, improvement, and acquisition of facilities and equipment for broadband service in eligible rural communities.
The 2018 farm bill, which was signed by the President on December 20, 2018 ( P.L. 115-334 , Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018), adds a grant component to the broadband loan program, increases the annual authorization level from $25 million to $350 million, and changes the proposed service area threshold from 15% to 50%.
Community Connect Broadband Grants The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ) appropriated $9 million ""for a grant program to finance broadband transmission in rural areas eligible for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program benefits authorized by 7 U.S.C. 950aaa."" Essentially operating the same as the pilot broadband grants, the program provides grant money to applicants proposing to provide broadband on a ""community-oriented connectivity"" basis to currently unserved rural areas for the purpose of fostering economic growth and delivering enhanced health care, education, and public safety services.
Section 779 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ) appropriated $600 million to RUS to ""conduct a new broadband loan and grant pilot program."" The law states that the funding is to ""remain available until expended,"" and that at least 90% of the households to be served by a project receiving a loan or grant under the pilot program shall be in a rural area without sufficient access to broadband, defined for this pilot program as 10 Mbps downstream, and 1 Mbps upstream, which shall be reevaluated and redetermined, as necessary, on an annual basis by the Secretary of Agriculture; an entity to which a loan or grant is made under the pilot program shall not use the loan or grant to overbuild or duplicate broadband expansion efforts made by any entity that has received a broadband loan from RUS; in addition to other available funds, not more than 4% of the funds can be used for administrative costs to carry out the pilot program and up to 3% may be utilized for technical assistance and predevelopment planning activities to support the most rural communities; and RUS shall adhere to the notice, reporting, and service area assessment requirements previously established in the 2014 farm bill.
As set forth in the statute, at least 90% of the households to be served by a project receiving a loan or grant under the pilot program shall be in a rural area without sufficient access to broadband at a minimum speed of 10 Mbps/1 Mbps.
The committee noted that tribal communities continue to struggle with gaining access to broadband service, and encouraged the Secretary to provide a report that identifies the specific challenges Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) have in gaining access to broadband service and provide a plan for addressing these challenges, including how the Community Connect program can assist ITOs. Regarding telecommunications loans, the House matched the Administration proposal, providing a loan level of $690 million ($345 million in direct Treasury loans and $345 million in FFB loans) with an appropriation of $0.863 million to subsidize direct Treasury loans.
In the committee report, the committee expressed its view that ""it is important for Departments to avoid efforts that could duplicate existing networks built by private investment or those built leveraging and utilizing other federal programs."" As such, the committee ""directs the Secretary of Agriculture to coordinate with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) to ensure wherever possible that broadband loans and grants issued under the pilot program are being targeted to areas that are currently unserved."" The committee directed USDA to use the NTIA's assessment of the current state of broadband access nationwide, and to explore using all broadband technologies, including, but not limited to, fiber, cable modem, fixed wireless, and television white space.
The committee also recommended that USDA explore a pilot grant program to demonstrate the use of multistrand fiber-optic cable that exists as part of electrical transmission infrastructure to provide state-of-the-art broadband services to currently underserved rural schools and medical centers within a mile of the existing cable; encouraged RUS to coordinate with the FCC and other relevant federal entities when making determinations of sufficient broadband access, to ensure the most accurate and up-to-date broadband coverage data are used, while being cognizant of potential problems of overbuilding; encouraged the Secretary to utilize appropriate grant program funds to locate buried, antiquated infrastructure facilities prior to construction of new utilities infrastructure financed by RUS; and urged RUS to ensure the agency's criteria and application processes provide for fair consideration of open access projects by accounting for the unique structures and opportunities such projects present in advancing broadband deployment in unserved and underserved communities.
Specifically, Section 6104 of P.L. 113-79 made the following changes to the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program:  Project area eligibility—provides that an eligible area is one where not less than 15% of the households in the proposed service territory are unserved or have service levels below the minimum acceptable level of broadband service (which is set at 4 Mbps/1 Mbps)."
267,"Under the BUILD Act, the IDFC is to consolidate and expand the U.S. government's existing development finance functions—currently conducted primarily by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
The act states that it is U.S. policy to ""facilitate market-based private sector development and inclusive economic growth in less developed countries"" through financing, including to provide countries a robust alternative to state-directed investments by authoritarian governments and [U.S.] strategic competitors using best practices with respect to transparency and environmental and social safeguards, and which take into account the debt sustainability of partner countries (§1411).
While even a strengthened OPIC may not be able to compete ""dollar-for-dollar"" with China's DFI activity, supporters argue that the United States ""can and should do more to support international economic development with partners who have embraced the private sector-driven development model."" Others, however, argued that the act could have tightened the IDFC's focus with respect to China, for instance, by requiring the IDFC to have a specific focus on countering China's investment and economic influence; from this perspective, the failure to narrow the IDFC's scope makes it likely that the new entity may support projects of limited U.S. foreign policy and strategic interest—a concern that some critics have levied against OPIC.
The BUILD Act establishes the IDFC for the stated purpose of mobilizing private-sector capital and skills for the economic benefit of less-developed countries, as well as countries in transition from nonmarket to market economies, in support of U.S. development assistance and other foreign policy objectives (§1412(b)).
The act directs the IDFC to prioritize support to countries with low-income or lower-middle-income economies, establishes a position of Chief Development Officer on the board, and requires that a performance measurement system be developed that includes, among other things, standards and methods for ensuring the development performance of the corporation's portfolio.
In addition, the act requires the Board to establish a ""transparent and independent accountability mechanism"" to annually evaluate and report to the Board and Congress regarding statutory compliance with environmental, social, labor, human rights, and transparency standards; provide a forum for resolving concerns regarding the impacts of specific IDFC-supported projects with respect to such standards; and provide advice regarding IDFC projects, policies, and practices (§1415)."

269,"The official discretionary total of the enacted FY2019 Agriculture appropriation is $23.03 billion, $35 million more than was enacted in FY2018 (+0.2%; Table 2 ) on a comparable basis that excludes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
The $23.23 billion discretionary total in the House-reported FY2019 Agriculture appropriation would have been $14 million less than enacted in FY2018 (-0.1%; Table 2 , Figure 3 ).
In addition to discretionary spending, the House-reported bill also carried funding for mandatory spending—largely determined in separate authorizing laws—that would have totaled $121.82 billion, about $936 million less than in FY2018 because of automatic changes in economic conditions and entitlement enrollment rather than any change from congressional action.
For the 81 days (22%) of FY2019 through December 21, 2018, and the 21 days of the third CR that preceded February 15, 2019, the CRs continued the terms of the FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act (Section 101 of P.L. 115-245 ) and excluded the FY2018 change in mandatory program spending (CHIMP) on the Biomass Crop Assistance Program, which was not authorized for FY2019; and provided sufficient funding to maintain mandatory program levels, including for nutrition programs (Section 110)—this is the standard approach taken in recent years' CRs, but it was additionally important for SNAP, because some authorizations in the 2014 farm bill began expiring after FY2018."

272,"This situation occurs because, unlike Congress, the courts cannot provide tangible wet water by authorizing new water projects and/or water-transfer infrastructure (including funding for project development) that would allow the tribes to exploit their rights.
As discussed in the below section "" Steps in Settlement Process ,"" the primary federal entities tasked with prenegotiation, negotiation, and implementation duties for Indian water rights settlements are DOI, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
Funding Considerations in Funding Indian Water Rights Settlements The delivery of wet water (as opposed to paper water) to tribes that have enacted settlement agreements frequently requires significant financial resources and long-term investments by the federal government, often in the form of new projects and infrastructure.
The fund may be used to implement a water rights settlement agreement approved by Congress that resolves, in whole or in part, litigation involving the United States, and it may be used if the settlement agreement or implementing legislation requires Reclamation to provide financial assistance for or to plan, design, or construct a water project.
Recent Indian Water Rights Settlement Legislation Since 2009, Congress has enacted nine Indian water rights settlements involving 13 tribes, at an authorized federal cost of more than $2 billion."

274,"As then–D.C. Circuit Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in a dissenting opinion, ""[t]he [F]irst [A]mendment secures to persons in the United States the respect of our government for their right to communicate and associate with foreign individuals and organizations."" Referring to Lamont , she observed that ""the first federal law the Supreme Court ever held violative of the [F]irst [A]mendment involved a condition on international correspondence—a restraint on delivery of mail from abroad."" While finding it unnecessary to decide in that case ""whether the [F]irst [A]mendment limits the actions of U.S. officials in their dealings with foreign parties,"" Judge Ginsburg noted the following principle from the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations :  The provisions of the United States Constitution safeguarding individual rights generally control the United States government in the conduct of its foreign relations as well as in domestic matters, and generally limit governmental authority whether it is exercised in the United States or abroad, and whether such authority is exercised unilaterally or by international agreement.
Judge Ginsburg concluded by stating that she ""would hesitate long before holding that in a United States-foreign citizen encounter, the amendment we prize as 'first' has no force in court."" Based on these principles and decisions, there may be some cases involving social media content posted by foreign nationals that implicate the free speech rights of U.S. citizens, who may be members of the particular online forum or otherwise have access to it.
It reasoned that the law itself ""regulates speech on the basis of its content"" because whether plaintiffs are subject to prosecution ""depends on what they say."" Referring to the statutory definitions of ""training"" and ""expert advice or assistance,"" the Court noted that if the plaintiffs' speech to the organizations ""imparts a 'specific skill' or communicates advice derived from 'specialized knowledge'—for example, training on the use of international law or advice on petitioning the United Nations—then it is barred."" Even if the law "" generally functions as a regulation of conduct,"" the Court reasoned, in these circumstances, ""as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message."" As discussed in more detail infra , the Court ultimately held that the material support statute did not violate the First Amendment as applied to the plaintiffs' proposed activities because the challenged statutory prohibitions were necessary to further the government's asserted interests in combating terrorism.
While some scholars have cited the true threats doctrine as one avenue for the government to regulate social media content promoting terrorism or violence, others have argued that the Supreme Court's decisions in this area may provide inadequate guidance for distinguishing between real threats online and protected expression, particularly in cases where judges do not share the same linguistic frame of reference as members of a particular online community."
275,"The House report concluded that independent OIGs ""are urgently needed."" The Senate report concluded that ""with rare exceptions, the agencies have not adequately policed their own operations and programs."" OIGs were designed to provide Congress and federal agency heads independent, nonpartisan analysis, conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, to identify and recommend ways to limit waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs and enhance operational and program efficiency and effectiveness.
They are predominantly located in executive branch agencies, but several legislative branch entities—for example, the Library of Congress (LOC), GAO, and the Government Publishing Office (GPO)—also have OIGs. The overwhelming majority of OIGs, including the U.S. Small Business Administration OIG (SBA OIG), are governed by the IG Act. It structures inspector general (IG) appointments and removals, powers and authorities, and duties and responsibilities.
The SBA's OIG provided several examples in its FY2018 semi-annual reports to Congress of what it considered to be among its more noteworthy audits, including the following: The State Trade Expansion Program An audit of the SBA's State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) determined that ""while SBA has made significant progress in improving the overall management and effectiveness of STEP since the audit of the pilot program in 2012, SBA needs to improve its performance measures and its program oversight"" or be ""at risk of not fully realizing the impact of the program in increasing the number of small businesses exploring significant new trade opportunities."" The OIG made six recommendations to improve the program."
276,"Although Congress has not enacted a law or resolution prohibiting the President from terminating NAFTA unilaterally, such action could place the President's authority at the ""lowest ebb."" In that scenario, the President may act in contravention of the will of Congress only in matters involving exclusive presidential prerogatives that are ""at once so conclusive and preclusive"" that they ""disabl[e] the Congress from acting upon the subject."" Members of the executive branch have suggested that treaty termination is part of the President's plenary powers, but one could plausibly advance the counterargument that the legislative branch plays a shared role in the termination process, especially in matters that implicate Congress's enumerated powers, such as international trade.
But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviews the USTR's actions under Section 301, has held that, under the Administrative Procedure Act, ""[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent."" Furthermore, a court may hold agency action unlawful when there has been ""a clear misconstruction of the governing statute"" or ""action outside delegated authority."" Because the text and legislative history of Section 301 indicate that Congress merely intended the provision to furnish the Executive with broad authority to take action against unfair foreign trade practices by imposing various barriers to trade under domestic law, it seems unlikely that a court would accord deference to a USTR interpretation that Section 301 authorizes the President to deliver notice of termination to Canada or Mexico."
277,"Next, it discusses issues related to financing a postsecondary education, including the extent to which borrowers may have any loans borrowed to finance educational expenses discharged due to a school closure and whether future financial assistance, including federal student loans, Pell Grants, and GI educational benefits, may be available to students should they decide to continue their postsecondary education at another IHE.
Finally, this report describes some potential income tax implications for students when their IHE has closed, including the extent to which they may incur a federal income tax liability for loans discharged and whether higher education tax credits remain available to them in future years.
For HEA Title IV federal student loans (i.e., loans made under the Direct Loan [DL], Federal Family Education Loan [FFEL], and Perkins Loan programs), borrowers may be provided some relief from being required to repay their federal student loans through a closed school loan discharge.

279,"While the SOAR Act provides funding for scholarships for students to attend participating private elementary and secondary schools as well as funding for DC public schools and DC public charter schools, the focus of this report is on the DC OSP.
Findings and Purpose of the Program Section 3002 includes congressional findings related to the SOAR Act that discuss parental school choice, the inadequacy of public school choice in the District of Columbia, student performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and per-pupil expenditures in the District of Columbia, the DC School Choice Incentive Act, interest in the DC OSP and evaluation findings, and congressional commitment to continuing the DC OSP as part of a three-pronged funding strategy that also includes DC public schools and DC public charter schools.
Entities Eligible to Administer DC OSP at the Local Level The Secretary of Education (hereinafter referred to as the Secretary) is required to award a competitive grant to one or more eligible entities with approved applications to implement a program to provide eligible students with expanded school choice options.
To receive a grant, an eligible entity is required to submit an application that includes a detailed description of how the entity will do the following: address the program priorities (see subsequent discussion); ensure that a random selection process, which gives weight to the priorities discussed below, will be used if more eligible students apply for a scholarship than can be accommodated in the DC OSP; ensure that if more participating eligible students seek enrollment at a participating private school than the school can accommodate, the school will use a random selection process to select participating eligible students; notify parents of eligible students about the availability of expanded choice opportunities to enable parents to make informed decisions; carry out activities to provide parents of eligible students with expanded choice options by awarding scholarships; determine the amount that will be provided to parents for the payment of tuition, fees, and transportation expenses, if applicable; seek out private elementary and secondary schools in DC to participate in the program; ensure that each participating private school will meet the reporting and other program requirements; ensure that each participating private school will submit to site visits by the eligible entities as determined necessary by the eligible entity; ensure that participating schools are financially responsible and will use the funds received effectively; ensure the financial viability of participating private schools in which 85% or more of all students enrolled in the school are participating eligible students that use a scholarship; address the renewal of scholarships for participating eligible students, including continued eligibility; ensure that a majority of its voting board members or governing organization are DC residents; and ensure that it utilizes internal fiscal and quality controls and complies with applicable financial reporting requirements and DC OSP requirements.
First, in awarding scholarships, the eligible entity must give priority to two types of students—(1) an eligible student who, in the school year preceding the school year for which the eligible student is applying for a scholarship, attended an elementary or secondary school identified as one of the lowest-performing schools under DC's accountability system; and (2) students whose household includes a sibling or other child who is already participating in the program of the eligible entity, regardless of whether such students have previously been assigned to a DC OSP evaluation control group or have previously attended a private school.
An eligible entity is required to use the grant funds to provide eligible students with scholarships to pay tuition, fees, and transportation expenses (if applicable) to enable the eligible student to attend the participating private school of his/her choice.
The results of this study were required to be submitted to Congress no later than the end of the first full fiscal year after the date of enactment of the SOAR Reauthorization Act. The eligible entity can also use the funds for educating parents about the program and assisting them with the application process, including providing information about the program and participating schools, providing funds to assist parents in meeting expenses that might otherwise preclude the participation of eligible students in the DC OSP, and for streamlining the application process.
The eligible entity is also permitted to use up to 1% of the funds appropriated each year for the DC OSP to provide tutoring services to participating eligible students who need additional academic assistance.
The eligible entity is also required to ensure that each participating private school during a given school year reports to the parents of each scholarship participant on the student's academic achievement; the safety of the school, including data on the incidence of school violence, student suspensions, and student expulsions; and the school's accreditation status.
Second, the SOAR Act stated that provisions of the FY2010 appropriations act related to a report on the academic rigor and quality of each participating school and a requirement that the Secretary ensure that site inspections are conducted at each participating private school at least twice a year no longer applied.
In its first evaluation of the program, the Government Accountability Office found that WSF expanded its operations from ""$150,000 in federal and foundation grants in fiscal year 2004 to $12.9 million in 2006 without sufficient accountability mechanisms to govern the use of the OSP funds."" GAO also determined that WSF ""did not have the capacity to oversee participating private schools and administer a growing scholarship program funded with federal dollars."" GAO made several recommendations to ED about directing the grantee to improve internal controls, continue to integrate its financial systems, improve monitoring, and ""provide accurate and complete information to parents."" The findings from the GAO evaluation are discussed in greater detail below."
280,"Introduction1 Since its founding in 2006, the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative has promoted an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment, while retaining the structure of the electoral college system.
Reform advocates have long focused on the fact that it does not provide for direct democratic election, that less-populous states are afforded an arithmetical advantage due to the assignment of two electors to each state, regardless of population, and that the winner-take-all system makes it possible for candidates to win an electoral college majority and the presidency, while gaining fewer votes than their principal opponents in the popular election.
Although the level of support for NPV was lower than that measured for generic direct popular election, a plurality of respondents to this question favored the ""National Popular Vote Interstate Compact"" by a plurality of 43% in favor, to 33% opposed and 23% who reported ""Don't know/No opinion."" The Elections of 2000 and 2016 and Electoral College Reform The disputed presidential election of 2000 was arguably a catalyst for new thinking on electoral college reform .
Bennett of Northwestern University, Vikram Amar of the University of California-Davis, and Akhil Amar of Yale University School of Law are generally credited as the intellectual godparents of the concept that ultimately evolved into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which relies on the Constitution's broad grant of power to each state to ""appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct [emphasis added], a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress."" Project FairVote, an issue advocacy group self-described as a nonprofit, nonpartisan ""501(c)(4)"" organization, appears to have been an incubator of the NPV concept.
According to NPV, the central argument in favor is that the compact ""would guarantee the Presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes [or at least a plurality] in all 50 states (and the District of Columbia)."" According to NPV, there would never again be a presidential election ""misfire"" or another ""wrong winner."" Other elements of the electoral college system criticized by NPV advocates (and other electoral college reformers) would arguably disappear or be rendered irrelevant.
Supporters of the NPV argue that the Constitution provides the legal means for states to transform the presidential election system into one where the President is elected based solely on the result of the national popular vote."
281,"A House Judiciary Committee report on a related bill in the 109 th Congress to provide special immigrant status for Iraqi and Afghan translators ( H.R. 2293 ) described the need for the legislation, as follows: A number of alien translators currently working in Iraq and Afghanistan embedded with units of the U.S. Armed Forces are providing extremely valuable services.
This law required the one-year employment period to end by December 31, 2014, and required principal aliens to file an application with the Chief of Mission in Afghanistan by September 30, 2014 (see "" Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visa Application Process "").
Regarding the future of the Afghan SIV program, the act included the following provision: It is the sense of Congress that the necessity of providing special immigrant status under this subsection should be assessed at regular intervals by the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, taking into account the scope of the current and planned presence of United States troops in Afghanistan, the current and prospective numbers of citizens and nationals of Afghanistan employed ...
incidental to the issuance of such visas, including required screenings and background checks, should be completed not later than 9 months after the date on which an eligible alien submits all required materials to complete an application for such visa."" At the same time, the act included an exception to the nine-month limit in ""high-risk cases for which satisfaction of national security concerns requires additional time.""  The FY2014 NDAA included reporting requirements related to application processing under the SIV programs for Afghans and Iraqis who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government."
282,"This report provides an overview of Medicare Part B premiums, including information on Part B eligibility and enrollment, late-enrollment penalties, collection of premiums, determination of annual premium amounts, premiums for high-income enrollees, premium assistance for low-income enrollees, protections for Social Security recipients from rising Part B premiums, and historical Medicare Part B premium trends.
(See "" Premium Assistance for Low-Income Beneficiaries ."")  Part B enrollees whose premiums are not deducted from Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Civil Service Retirement monthly benefits; are paid by Medicaid; or are paid by another person or organization must pay premiums directly to CMS.
Premiums may be adjusted upward for late enrollment (see "" Late-Enrollment Premium Penalty and Exemptions "") and for beneficiaries with high incomes (see "" Income-Related Premiums ""), or they may be adjusted downward for those protected by the hold-harmless provision (see "" Protection of Social Security Benefits from Increases in Medicare Part B Premiums "").
To mitigate the expected large premium increases for those not held harmless in 2016, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 15; P.L. 114-74 ) required that 2016 Medicare Part B premiums be set as if the hold-harmless rule were not in effect—in other words, to calculate premiums as if all enrollees were paying the same annual inflation-adjusted standard premium.
To offset the approximately $9 billion in increased federal spending in 2016 resulting from the reduction in standard premiums for those not held harmless, a $3.00 surcharge was added to the monthly premium in 2016, and will continue to be applied in subsequent years until the additional federal costs are fully offset.
The hold-harmless provision that prevents a beneficiary's Social Security benefits from decreasing from one year to the next as a result of the Part B premium increase does not apply to those subject to an income-related increase in their Part B premiums.
In 2011, of the 27% who were not eligible to be held harmless, about 3% were new Medicare enrollees, about 5% were high-income, about 17% had their premiums paid for by Medicaid, and the remaining 2% did not have their premiums withheld from Social Security benefit payments.
Those not held harmless included those eligible for premium assistance through their state Medicaid programs (about 19%), those who paid the high-income premiums (about 6%), those who did not receive Social Security benefits (3%), and new enrollees in 2016 (5%).
If that person had been held harmless in 2017 and was paying a Medicare Part B premium of $109.00 per month, this Social Security benefit increase would have been more than enough to cover the $25.00 difference between that individual's reduced Part B 2017 premium amount of $109.00 and the 2018 premium of $134.00."
283,"The hearings were designed to help the committee meet the requirements of H.Res. 418 ""to write, and recommend to the House, a set of standards for the official conduct of the Chambers' Members and employees."" In March 1968, the committee issued a report summarizing their activities and recommending continuation of the committee as a select committee; changes in the committee's jurisdiction and powers; creation of a Code of Official Conduct and financial disclosure rules for Members, officers, and employees of the House; establishment of standardized controls by the Committee on House Administration over committees using counterpart funds (foreign currencies held by U.S. embassies that can only be spent in the country of origin); a prompt review of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act (reporting of campaign expenditures) by the House; and compliance by House candidates with applicable provisions of the proposed Code of Official Conduct.
The resolution provided for (1) continuation of the Committee on Standards as a permanent standing House committee; (2) enumeration of the committee's jurisdiction and powers; (3) creation of the first House Code of Official Conduct (Rule XLIII); and (4) adoption of the first financial disclosure requirements for Members, officers, and designated employees (Rule XLIV)."
284,"Introduction On March 8, 2018, President Trump issued two proclamations imposing tariffs on U.S. imports of certain steel and aluminum products, respectively, using presidential powers granted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
Section 232 authorizes the President to impose restrictions on certain imports based on an affirmative determination by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) that the targeted products are being imported into the United States ""in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security."" Section 232 investigations and actions are important for Congress, as the Constitution gives it primary authority over international trade matters.
Once the President receives the report, he has 90 days to decide whether or not he concurs with the Commerce Department's findings and recommendations, and to determine the nature and duration of the action he views as necessary to adjust the imports so they no longer threaten to impair the national security (generally, imposition of some trade-restrictive measure).
In the first of these reports (1987), Commerce recommended a series of steps to increase domestic energy production and ensure adequate oil supplies rather than imposing quotas, fees, or tariffs because any such actions would not be ""cost beneficial and, in the long run, impair rather than enhance national security."" In the latter two investigations (1994 and 1999), Commerce found that existing government programs and activities related to energy security would be more appropriate and cost effective than import adjustments.
In addition to the two recent cases on steel and aluminum, on May 23, 2018, after consultations with President Trump, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the initiation of a Section 232 investigation to determine whether imports of automobiles, including SUVs, vans and light trucks, and automotive parts threaten to impair national security.
Relationship to WTO While unilateral trade restrictions may appear to be counter to U.S. trade liberalization commitments under the WTO agreements, Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which predates and was one of the foundational agreements of the WTO, allows WTO members to take measures to protect ""essential security interests."" Broad national security exceptions are also included in international trade obligations at the bilateral and regional levels, and could potentially limit the ability of countries to challenge such actions by trade partners.
The Secretary of Defense, while concurring with Commerce's ""conclusion that imports of foreign steel and aluminum based on unfair trading practices impair the national security,"" recommended targeted tariffs and that ""an inter-agency group further refine the targeted tariffs, so as to create incentives for trade partners to work with the U.S. on addressing the underlying issue of Chinese transshipment"" in which Chinese producers ship goods to another country to reexport.
In the proclamations, the President established a bifurcated approach, instructing Commerce to establish a process for domestic parties to request individual product exclusions and a U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)-led process to discuss ""alternative ways"" through diplomatic negotiations to address the threat with countries having a ""security relationship"" with the United States."
285,"The Office of the National Ombudsman, housed within the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), is fairly unique in that it is authorized to help resolve disputes received from the public across federal agencies.
As an impartial liaison, the Office of the National Ombudsman ""directs reported regulatory fairness matters to the appropriate agency for high-level fairness review, and works across government to address those concerns, reduce regulatory burdens, and help small businesses succeed."" SBREFA also created a five-person Small Business Regulatory Fairness Board in each of the SBA's 10 regions to advise the National Ombudsman on matters related to federal regulatory enforcement activities affecting small businesses."
286,"This proposal authorized the President (rather than the Secretary of the Interior) to issue ""public proclamation[s]"" to protect ""historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest"" on federal land as ""national monuments."" This proposal also limited the amount of land reserved for each monument ""to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected[.]""  The Senate bill was passed by voice vote in that chamber on May 24, 1906.
The second section—the core of the act—authorizes the President ""in his discretion"" ""to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments."" In addition to protecting the ""objects"" themselves, the act also authorizes the President to ""reserve .
Recognizing the Grand Canyon as ""the greatest eroded canyon in the United States"" and ""one of the great natural wonders,"" the Court noted that it ""has attracted wide attention among explorers and scientists"" and ""affords an unexampled field for geological study."" Thus, the Court concluded that the Grand Canyon was an ""object[] of unusual scientific interest"" for purposes of the Antiquities Act. President Franklin Roosevelt's 1943 establishment of the Jackson Hole National Monument—a 221,610-acre monument in Wyoming — generated both litigation and legislation.
""[T]he President's Antiquities Act authority,"" the court explained, ""is not limited to protecting only archaeological sites."" The court of appeals then decided that it had no occasion to resolve the second argument—that the reserved land was not the smallest area compatible with the preservation of the objects—because it determined that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of ""identify[ing] the improperly designated lands with sufficient particularity to state a claim."" Notably, the district court in each of these cases dismissed the suits by concluding that judicial review of proclamations under the Antiquities Act is limited ""to the face of the Proclamation,"" thus prohibiting courts from reviewing ""the President's determinations and factual findings."" The D.C. Circuit, however, declined to ""decide the availability or scope of judicial review of a Presidential Proclamation ."
287,"The volume requirements set by EPA for 2019 for total renewable fuel, advanced biofuel, and cellulosic biofuel are all less than the volumes called for in statute but greater than the previous year's volumes—an annual occurrence that started in 2014.
For several years following the 2010 issuance of the amended RFS final rule, EPA has had difficulty projecting certain volume requirements (e.g., cellulosic biofuels) which have led EPA to use its waiver authority to set annual volume requirements for cellulosic biofuel, total advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel different from what was stated in the statute."
288,"Current Eligibility Currently, the Purple Heart is authorized for any member of the U.S. Armed Forces who has been wounded or died from wounds sustained under one of the following conditions:  (1) In accordance with E.O. 11016, subject to the provisions of Sections 1129, 1129a, and 1131 of Title 10, U.S.C., and P.L. 104-106 , the Secretary of a Military Department, will, in the name of the President of the United States, award the PH, with suitable ribbons and appurtenances, to any Service member under the jurisdiction of that Department who, after April 5, 1917, has been wounded, killed, or who has died or may hereafter die of wounds received under any of the following circumstances: (a) In action against an opposing armed force of a foreign country in which U.S. Armed Forces are or have been engaged.

For example, the statute authorizing the Five-Star Generals commemorative coin stated: Surcharges The surcharges section of the legislation typically sets the surcharges (amount above the face value that the U.S. Mint charges) per coin and designates the distribution of these surcharges to recipient organizations.
The introduction of commemorative coin legislation often serves two purposes: to honor people, places, events, or institutions and to provide designated recipient groups with potential surcharge funds."
292,"""Most"" of these cases involved public officials who ""made governmental decisions with the objective of benefitting themselves or promoting their own interests, instead of fulfilling their legal commitment to provide the citizens of the State or local government with their loyal service and honest government."" Regardless of whether the betrayed party (the citizenry) was or would be financially harmed, under this theory, the violation lay in the deprivation of that party's intangible right to the official's ""honest services."" This is not to say that the doctrine extended only to public officials, however—courts came to recognize that a private employee could also be guilty of mail or wire fraud for breaching a fiduciary duty to the employer.
The defendants were convicted of mail fraud on the theory that the officials deprived the citizens of Kentucky of ""their intangible rights to honest and impartial government"" by misusing their offices ""for private gain."" The Supreme Court reversed, however, examining the text and legislative history of the mail fraud statute to conclude that the provision was ""limited in scope to the protection of property rights."" In the Court's view, a broader reading would ""leave [the statute's] outer boundaries ambiguous and involve[] the Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials."" In other words, the Court's decision was driven by two constitutional concerns that have underlain much of the subsequent commentary on the scope of the honest services doctrine: first, a criminal statute may violate the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments if it is so vague that ""ordinary people can[not] understand what conduct is prohibited."" Thus, by alluding to the potentially ""ambiguous"" ""outer boundaries"" of the mail fraud statute, the Court was signaling that, if not construed more narrowly, the statute could be considered unconstitutionally vague.
private-sector fraud"" that ""might otherwise go unpunished."" Significantly, the Court in Skilling rejected the argument, advanced by the government, that Section 1346 should be construed to extend as well to ""undisclosed self-dealing by a public official or private employee—i.e., the taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty."" Although courts prior to Skilling had recognized bribery and undisclosed conflicts of interest as the two ""typical[]"" scenarios giving rise to honest services fraud prosecutions, the Supreme Court viewed an undisclosed self-dealing or conflict-of-interest category of honest services fraud as ""amorphous"" given that lower courts had ""reached no consensus on which schemes qualified."" The Court thus refused to adopt the government's ""less constrained construction,"" that is, one that would include undisclosed self-dealing, ""absent Congress' clear instruction otherwise."" In a footnote, the Court went on to provide guidance to Congress should it decide ""to take up the enterprise of criminalizing"" such conduct, noting that legislation ""would have to employ standards of sufficient definiteness and specificity to overcome due process concerns."" In the Court's view, the formulation proposed by the government—a prohibition on the ""taking of official action by the employee,"" with the specific intent to deceive, ""that furthers his own [material] undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty""—would ""leave[] many questions unanswered,"" including (1) how significant the conflicting interest would have to be, (2) the extent to which official action would have to further the interest, and (3) what (and to whom) information should be conveyed in order for disclosure to be adequate."

Regarding the second issue above, supporters of procuring LPD-31 with full funding could argue that it would leave more budgetary room in FY2021 and perhaps one or more years beyond that for funding other Navy programs, and that Navy surface ships other than aircraft carriers and LHA/LHD-type amphibious assault ships have generally been procured with full funding rather than incremental funding."

296,"The Clean Water Act itself does not expand further on the meaning of ""waters of the United States."" Instead, the Corps and EPA have expounded on this phrase through agency guidance and regulations, which federal courts have struck down on various occasions as failing to satisfy statutory or constitutional requirements.
For a period after its enactment in 1972, courts generally interpreted the Clean Water Act as having a wide jurisdictional reach, but, in recent decades, the Supreme Court has emphasized that ""the grant of authority to Congress under the Commerce Clause, though broad, is not unlimited.""

297,"The modern housing assistance programs include both relatively flexible grants to state and local governments to serve homeless people, build affordable housing, provide assistance to first-time homebuyers, and promote community development; and more structured, direct assistance programs that provide low-cost apartments and rental vouchers to poor families, administered through local public, quasi-public, and private intermediaries.
The federal government also makes tax credits available to states to distribute to developers of low-cost housing and provides mortgage insurance to lenders that make certain types of mortgages to eligible homebuyers or developers of multifamily housing.
The act declared that it was the policy of the United States to promote the general welfare of the nation by employing its funds and credit, as provided in this Act, to assist the several states and their political subdivisions to alleviate present and recurring unemployment and to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low-income, in rural or urban communities, that are injurious to the health, safety, and morals of the citizens of the nation.
The Housing Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-171) declared the goal of ""a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family."" The act (1) established a federal urban redevelopment and slum clearance program, authorizing federal loans of $1 billion over a five-year period to help local redevelopment agencies acquire slum properties and assemble sites for redevelopment; (2) reactivated the public housing program for low-income families (which had been on hold during World War II), authorizing subsidies to local housing authorities sufficient to build 810,000 units over six years; (3) expanded the FHA's mortgage insurance program to promote home building and homeownership; (4) created within the U.S. Department of Agriculture a program of financial assistance and subsidies to improve housing conditions on farms and in rural areas; and (5) authorized federal grants for research, primarily to improve the productivity of the housing industry.
The purposes of QHWRA, as defined in the act, were to deregulate PHAs, provide PHAs with more flexibility in their use of federal assistance, facilitate mixed income communities, decrease concentrations of poverty in public housing, increase accountability and reward effective management of PHAs, create incentives and economic opportunities for residents assisted by PHAs to work and become self-sufficient, consolidate the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs into a single market-driven program, remedy the problems of troubled PHAs, and replace or revitalize severely distressed public housing projects.
Specific reforms in QHWRA included increased income targeting in the voucher program, removal of federal preference categories for housing assistance, enactment of a limited community service requirement in public housing, creation of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program (a hybrid of the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs), authorization of the HOPE VI program, consolidation and reform of funding for public housing, and modifications to the assessment systems for PHAs. QHWRA also featured the so-called ""Faircloth Amendment,"" which prohibited the use of public housing funding for the development of any net new units of public housing.
Rental Housing Assistance Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers (vouchers) are a form of tenant-based rental assistance funded by the federal government, administered locally by quasi-governmental PHAs, and provided to private landlords on behalf of low-income families.

298,"It reflected compromise of the House- and Senate-passed bills, providing the following amounts within the STAG account ($2.875 billion total): $625 million for clean water SRF grants, $1.275 billion for drinking water SRF grants, $165 million, as requested, for U.S.-Mexico border projects, Texas colonias , and Alaska Native Village projects, $136 million for 18 specific wastewater, water, and groundwater project grants (the 7 specified in House-passed H.R. 3666 , plus 11 more; the bill provided funds for each of the needy cities projects requested by the Administration, but in lesser amounts), and $674 million for consolidated state grants, which could support implementation of a range of environmental programs.
This bill, passed by the Senate July 17, provided $3.2 billion for the STAG account, consisting of $1.4 billion for clean water SRF grants, $800 million for drinking water SRF grants, $105 million for U.S.-Mexico and Alaska Native Village projects, $100 million for 39 other special needs infrastructure grants, and $850 million for state performance partnership/categorical grants.
This bill provided $3.2 billion for the STAG account, consisting of $1.25 billion for clean water SRF grants, $775 million for drinking water SRF grants, $70 million for U.S.-Mexico and Alaska Native Village projects, $253.5 million for 49 other special needs infrastructure grants (including nine projects also funded in the Senate bill), and $885 million for state environmental management grants (a 20% increase above FY1998 amounts for these state grants).
Within that account, the bill included $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $820 million for drinking water SRF grants, $885 million for categorical state grants (which generally support state and tribal implementation and could address a range of environmental programs), $80 million for U.S.-Mexico border and Alaska Rural and Native Village projects, and $331.6 million for 141 other special needs water and wastewater grants specified in report language.
The Senate-passed total for the STAG account was $3.49 billion, including $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $140 million for special needs infrastructure grants specified in accompanying report language, $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, $30 million for Alaska Rural and Native Villages, and $1.03 billion for state categorical program grants.
The final bill did not include separate funds for the new sewer overflow grant program requested by the Administration, which both the House and Senate had rejected, but it did include $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $344 million for 337 earmarked water infrastructure project grants specified in report language, and the requested $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects and $30 million for Alaska Rural and Native Villages.
In addition, the Senate committee bill included $875 million for drinking water SRF grants, $140 million for special needs infrastructure grants specified in report language, $45 million for Alaska Rural and Native Village project grants, $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.134 billion for state categorical program grants, which could address a range of environmental programs.
On September 9, 2004, the House Appropriations Committee reported FY2005 funding for EPA in a bill that included the Administration's requested level of $850 million for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and earmarked grants for priority water infrastructure projects totaling $393.4 million ( H.R. 5041 , H.Rept.
The final measure also included $843 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $401.7 million for 669 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and U.S.-Mexico border projects; and $1.14 billion for categorical state grants, which generally support state and tribal administration of a range of environmental programs.
The budget requested $730 million for clean water SRF grants (33% below FY2005 appropriated funding and 45.6% below the FY2004 level), $850 million for drinking water SRF grants (a slight increase from the FY2005 level), $69 million for priority projects (primarily in Alaska Native Villages and along the U.S.-Mexico border), and $1.2 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs.
The final FY2007 amounts provided in P.L. 110-5 were $1.084 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $837.5 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $83.75 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border project grants requested by the Administration, and $1.11 billion for categorical state grants, which could be used to administer a range of environmental programs.
The final FY2008 amounts provided in this legislation were $689.1 million for clean water SRF capitalization grants ($1.5 million more than requested by the Administration), $829.0 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($13.2 million less than requested), $177.2 million for 282 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and U.S.-Mexico border projects ($151.7 million more than requested), and $1.078 billion for categorical state grants ($13.3 million more than requested), which could address a range of environmental programs."
299,"Aviation Security1 Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress took swift action to create the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the U.S. Department of Transportation and gave it control over all airline passenger and baggage screening functions and deployment of armed air marshals on commercial passenger flights.
Despite the extensive focus on aviation security for more than a decade, a number of challenges remain, including effectively screening passengers, baggage, and cargo for explosives threats; developing effective risk-based methods for screening passengers and others with access to aircraft and sensitive areas; incorporating biometrics into the passenger screening process to verify identities; exploiting available intelligence information and watchlists to identify individuals who pose potential threats to civil aviation; implementing effective systems, regulations, and international agreements to assess risk and conduct risk-based screening of air cargo shipments worldwide; effectively deterring and responding to security threats in public areas of airports and at screening checkpoints; developing effective strategies for addressing aircraft vulnerabilities to shoulder-fired missiles and other standoff weapons; and addressing the potential security implications of unmanned aircraft operations in domestic airspace and developing effective countermeasures to protect critical infrastructure, including airports and aircraft, from attacks using drones.
The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-190 ) directed TSA to initiate a demonstration program at three to six large airports to examine passenger checkpoint reconfigurations that increase efficiencies and reduce vulnerabilities, and a separate demonstration program at three airports to develop and test next-generation screening system prototypes designed to expedite passenger handling.
Central issues surrounding the use of terrorist watchlists in the aviation domain that may be considered during the 116 th Congress include the speed with which watchlists are updated as new intelligence information becomes available; the extent to which all information available to the federal government is exploited to assess possible threats among passengers and airline and airport workers; the ability to detect identity fraud or other attempts to circumvent terrorist watchlist checks; the adequacy of established protocols for providing redress to individuals improperly identified as potential threats; and the adequacy of coordination with international partners.
Foreign Last Point of Departure Airports TSA regulates foreign air carriers that operate flights to the United States to enforce requirements regarding the acceptance and screening of passengers, baggage, and cargo carried on those aircraft.
P.L. 115-254 directs TSA to implement the framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to manage cybersecurity risks and conduct cybersecurity vulnerability assessments, including cybersecurity evaluations of the PreCheck program as well as transportation worker credentialing programs that contain data on individuals."
300,"Yet, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections in January 2010, the current effective capital gains tax was 13.3% in 2008 and would have increased to 17.9% in 2019; applying the differential in these rates to the realizations in 2019 would have produced a revenue difference of $40 billion.
Such an approach has a number of complexities, and to the extent that these changes aim to address the behavioral response, it is important to understand the limits this behavioral assumption imposes on options for increasing taxes on realized capital gains and the empirical basis for these estimated effects.
The analysis in this report suggests that the Obama Administration's projections and those of the JCT, absent a change in their realizations response, may likely understate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire.
However, because the higher-income taxpayers who realize most capital gains can have significant fluctuations in income and taxes, transitory responses occur among individuals even in years when the law does not change.
The study provided data on the ratio of realizations to accruals, along with tax rates, over a long period of time, and used the average values to estimate the upper limit of the realizations elasticity.
Given the evidence from panel studies that use state variation to identify permanent effects and studies of the reasonableness of elasticities given realizations responses, both JCT and Treasury estimates appear high, so that they likely understate the revenue to be gained from increasing the tax rate.
Table 2 uses the elasticities from Table 1 and the CBO projections to compare these revenue estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points, for 2019, based on those results."
301,"Primary agencies, broadly speaking, have responsibilities as follows:  Department of the Treasury's OFAC designates SDNs to be subject to the blocking of U.S.-based assets; prohibits transactions; licenses transactions relating to exports (and limits those licenses); restricts access to U.S. financial services; restricts transactions related to travel, in limited circumstances; and identifies entities for placement on the SSI List as subject to investment and trade limitations.
In 2017, Congress introduced and the President signed into law legislation that strengthened existing sanctions authorities and established several new sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, malicious cyber-enabled activities, human rights abuses, and corruption.
The United States also has imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities in response to the use of a chemical weapon, weapons proliferation, trade with North Korea in violation of U.N. Security Council requirements, support for the Syrian government, transnational crime, and terrorism.
OFAC has drawn on EO 13661 and EO 13662 to designate a wider circle of Russian government officials, members of parliament, heads of state-owned companies, and other prominent businesspeople and associates, including individuals the Treasury Department has considered part of Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""inner circle."" It also has designated related entities.
The Administration could use these authorities to target the following:  significant foreign investment in deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale oil projects within Russia (§225, amending UFSA); foreign financial institutions that facilitate certain transactions for Russia's defense or energy sectors, or for those subject to Ukraine-related sanctions (§226, amending UFSA); those who engage in significant corruption (§227, amending UFSA); sanctions evaders and foreign persons that facilitate significant transactions for those subject to Russia-related sanctions (§228, amending SSIDES); investment in Russia's energy export pipelines (§232); investment (or facilitating investment) that contributes to the privatization of Russia's state-owned assets ""in a manner that unjustly benefits"" government officials and associates (§233); and any foreign person who supports or facilitates Syria's acquiring or developing a variety of advanced or prohibited weapons and defense articles, including weapons of mass destruction (§234).
and talk to partners and allies about where we find transactions that may be problematic.""  In October 2017, the Administration fulfilled a Section 231 requirement to ""specify the persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, [Russia's] defense and intelligence sectors."" The State Department emphasized that the 39 entities on the list were not subject to sanctions but that secondary sanctions could be imposed on individuals and entities ""that are determined to knowingly engage in a significant transaction with a person specified in the Guidance on or after the date of enactment of the Act."" In January 2018, the Administration indicated that the threat of Section 231 sanctions was having an effect without making any designations.
In January 2018 testimony to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin indicated that ""we intend to now use that report and that intelligence to go forward with additional sanctions.""  On April 6, 2018, OFAC designated several politically connected Russian billionaires (whom the Treasury Department referred to as oligarchs), companies owned or controlled by these individuals, and government officials.
If the President does not certify on all these terms, he, in consultation with Congress, is required to oppose support to Russia in international financial institutions; prohibit U.S. banks from making loans or providing credit to the Russian government, other than those related to the purchase of food or other agricultural commodities or products; prohibit exports to Russia of all other goods and technology, except food and other agricultural commodities and products; restrict importation into the United States of articles that are of Russia-origin growth, product, or manufacture; downgrade or suspend diplomatic relations; and set in motion the suspension of foreign air carriers owned or controlled by Russia ""to engage in foreign air transportation to or from the United States."" As of the start of 2019, the Secretary of State had not levied a new round of sanctions, nor had the President determined that Russia meets the three conditions needed to avert sanctions.
The prohibitions against transactions with Rosoboronexport do not apply to contracts related to the maintenance or repair of Mi-17 helicopters purchased by the United States ""for the purpose of providing assistance to the security forces of Afghanistan, as well as for the purpose of combating terrorism and violent extremism globally."" They also do not apply to procurement related to the purchase or maintenance of optical sensors that ""improve the U.S. ability to monitor and verify Russia's Open Skies Treaty compliance."" In October 2012, the Department of Commerce's BIS imposed restrictions on 119 Russian individuals and entities, and 45 others from 11 other countries, for suspected involvement in procurement and delivery of items to Russia for military-related and other governmental or related end uses in violation of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
Unlike the United States, the EU has not imposed sanctions on Russian individuals or entities for actions related to human rights violations, malicious cyber activity, corruption, transnational crime, or support to Syria or North Korea.
By the end of July 2014, the EU expanded its list of individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and visa bans and joined the United States in imposing sanctions on selected companies in Russia's financial, defense, and energy sectors."
302,"The Post-War Highway Program The Primary System funds were apportioned using the three formula factors established in 1916: each state's share of the national land area, population, and rural post road mileage, with each factor weighted equally.
Calculating Each State's Apportionment Under the FAST Act, the authorization that funds six programs within the Federal-Aid Highway Program is apportioned among the states by formula."
303,"The most recent parliamentary elections in 2016 resulted in a sizeable win for Georgia's center-left ruling party, Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), which initially led a ruling coalition after coming to power in 2012 and now governs alone.
In the end, the commission provided a ""positive assessment"" of the reforms, although it noted ""the postponement of the entry into force of the proportional election system to October 2024 is highly regrettable and a major obstacle to reaching consensus."" The Venice Commission said the reform ""completes the evolution of Georgia's political system towards a parliamentary system and constitutes a positive step towards the consolidation and improvement of the country's constitutional order, based on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights."" Economy For more than two decades, Georgia has been recovering from the severe economic decline it experienced after the Soviet Union collapsed.
In a visit to Tbilisi in August 2017, Vice President Michael Pence said the United States ""strongly condemns Russia's occupation on Georgia's soil."" In January 2018, the State Department indicated that ""the United States' position on Abkhazia and South Ossetia is unwavering: The United States fully supports Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.""  The United States supports a resolution to the conflict within these parameters.
The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-44 , Title II, §253) states that the United States ""supports the policy known as the 'Stimson Doctrine' and thus does not recognize territorial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations"" of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and other territories occupied by Russia.
In January 2019, a resolution (H.Res. 93) was reintroduced in the House supporting Georgia's territorial integrity and condemning a decision by the Syrian government to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states."
304,"In summary, a simple majority of the House can call up, debate, and vote on a measure in a single calendar day, regardless of how long the text has been available, by taking the following steps: First, the House agrees to a special rule waiving the one-day layover requirement for any special rule for the consideration of a specified matter."
305,"DOI currently reports annual deferred maintenance composed of estimates for four broad categories of assets: (1) roads, bridges, and trails; (2) irrigation, dams, and other water structures; (3) buildings; and (4) other structures.
Overview of Decade (FY2009-FY2018) Changes in Estimates in Current and Constant Dollars As shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 , in current dollars, the total deferred maintenance estimate for the four agencies showed considerable variation over the 10-year period from FY2009-FY2018, with a peak in FY2012.
Over the 10-year period, the NPS roads, bridges, and trails category had the highest share of the agency's deferred maintenance, and irrigation, dams, and other water structures had the smallest."
306,"Most bills and resolutions, for instance, are considered under a set of procedures called ""suspension of the rules"" (discussed later in this report) that limits all debate on a measure to a maximum of 40 minutes.
The reason for this dramatic difference between the rule in theory and the rule in practice lies in the consequences of a parliamentary motion to order what is called the ""previous question."" When a bill or resolution is called up for consideration in the House—and, therefore, under the hour rule—the Speaker recognizes the majority floor manager to control the first hour of debate.
However, the majority floor manager almost always yields to other Representatives ""for purposes of debate only."" Thus, no other Member may propose an amendment or make any motion during that hour.
Such a resolution—called a ""rule"" or ""special rule""—usually proposes to make a bill in order for floor consideration so that it can be debated, amended, and passed or defeated by a simple majority vote.
If the House votes against ordering the previous question on a special rule, a Member could offer an amendment to it, proposing to change the conditions under which the bill itself is to be considered."
307,"Objectives of the NFIP The NFIP has two main policy goals: (1) to provide access to primary flood insurance, thereby allowing for the transfer of some of the financial risk of property owners to the federal government; and (2) to mitigate and reduce the nation's comprehensive flood risk through the development and implementation of floodplain management standards.
The NFIP also engages in many ""non-insurance"" activities in the public interest: it disseminates flood risk information through flood maps, requires communities to adopt land use and building code standards in order to participate in the program, potentially reduces the need for other post-flood disaster aid, contributes to community resilience by providing a mechanism to fund rebuilding after a flood, and may protect lending institutions against mortgage defaults due to uninsured losses.
From the inception of the NFIP, the program has been expected to achieve multiple objectives, some of which may conflict with one another:  To ensure reasonable insurance premiums for all; To have risk-based premiums that would make people aware of and bear the cost of their floodplain location choices; To secure widespread community participation in the NFIP and substantial numbers of insurance policy purchases by property owners; and To earn premium and fee income that, over time, covers claims paid and program expenses.
Companies participating in the WYO program are compensated through a variety of methods, but this compensation is not directly based on the costs incurred by the WYOs. In the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Title II of P.L. 112-141 , hereinafter BW-12), Congress required FEMA to develop and issue a rulemaking on a ""methodology for determining the appropriate amounts that property and casualty insurance companies participating in the WYO program should be reimbursed for selling, writing, and servicing flood insurance policies and adjusting flood insurance claims on behalf of the National Flood Insurance Program."" This rulemaking was required within a year of enactment of BW-12.
In the 115 th Congress, H.R. 2874 included a provision that would have specified that if a property owner purchases private flood insurance and decides then to return to the NFIP, they would be considered to have maintained continuous coverage.
H.R. 2874 , Section 203, would have eliminated the non-compete requirement in the WYO arrangement with FEMA that restricted WYO companies from selling both NFIP and private flood insurance policies."
308,"Stafford Act Assistance in Response to Terrorism The Stafford Act authorizes the President to issue two types of declarations that could potentially provide federal assistance to states and localities in response to a terrorist attack: a ""major disaster declaration"" or an ""emergency declaration."" Major disaster declarations authorize a wide-range of federal assistance to states, local governments, tribal nations, individuals and households, and certain nonprofit organizations to aid recovery from a catastrophic event.
While the Stafford Act has been used to provide assistance in response to terrorist attacks in the past, recent incidents such as the mass shootings that occurred in 2015 and 2016 in San Bernardino, CA, and Orlando, FL, respectively, and the 2016 vehicular attacks in Nice, France, and Ohio State University may have brought to light some potential shortcomings in the Stafford Act. That is, certain terror attacks may not meet the criteria of a major disaster for two reasons.
Of interest here, the Stafford Act defines a major disaster as ""any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance."" The list of incidents that qualify for a major disaster declaration is specifically limited, and it is not clear if a terror attack would meet the legal definition of a major disaster if the incident involved something other than a fire or explosion.
In contrast to the prescribed definition of incidents that qualify as a major disaster, an emergency is defined more broadly to include ""any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States."" Some might argue that an emergency declaration would provide adequate assistance to individuals and households after a terrorist incident.
Definition The Stafford Act defines a major disaster as any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this chapter to supplement the efforts and available resources of states, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.
As with major disaster declarations, the President has the authority under an emergency declaration to direct any federal agency to use its authorities and resources in support of state and local response and recovery efforts under 502 of the Stafford Act. Also, the emergency authority includes Section 408 which means that housing assistance and grants for individuals and families could be provided under an emergency declaration.
Congress expanded on the list of specific incidents when it amended the definition in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 which defined a major disaster as  any hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, drought, fire, explosion, or other catastrophe in any part of the United States which, in the determination of the President, causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this Act, above and beyond emergency services by the federal government, to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby."
309,"Introduction This report provides background information and potential oversight issues for Congress on the Columbia-class program, a program to design and build a class of 12 new ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to replace the Navy's current force of 14 aging Ohio-class SSBNs. The Navy has identified the Columbia-class program as the Navy's top priority program.
U.S.-UK Cooperation on SLBMs and the New UK SSBN As one expression of U.S.-UK cooperation on nuclear weapon matters that dates back to World War II, the UK's four Vanguard-class SSBNs, which entered service in 1993-1999, each carry 16 Trident II D-5 SLBMs, and previous classes of UK SSBNs similarly carried earlier-generation U.S. SLBMs. The UK plans to replace the four Vanguard-class boats with three or four Dreadnought-class next-generation SSBNs. Dreadnought-class boats are to be equipped with 12 missile launch tubes, but current UK plans call for each boat to carry eight D-5 SLBMs, with the other four tubes not being used for SLBMs. The United States is providing technical assistance to the United Kingdom for the Dreadnought-class program, as it has over the years for some other UK submarine programs; for additional discussion, see Appendix B .
Planned Procurement Quantity and Schedule Planned Procurement Quantity Navy plans call for procuring 12 Columbia-class boats to replace the current force of 14 Ohio-class SSBNs. In explaining the planned procurement quantity of 12 boats, the Navy states the following: Ten operational SSBNs—meaning boats not encumbered by lengthy maintenance actions—are needed to meet strategic nuclear deterrence requirements for having a certain number of SSBNs at sea at any given moment.
The Trump Administration's Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), released in February 2018, states the following: ""The COLUMBIA-class program will deliver a minimum of 12 SSBNs to replace the current OHIO fleet and is designed to provide required capabilities for decades."" The use of the word ""minimum"" in that sentence can be viewed as signaling a possibility that the required number of Columbia-class boats might at some point be increased to something more than 12 boats.
2218a) has been amended to give the NSBDF an additional function of acting as a vehicle or repository for certain special acquisition authorities that have the potential for reducing at the margin the cost of Columbia-class boats and other Navy nuclear-powered ships (i.e., aircraft carriers and attack submarines).
GAO Perspective An April 2019 GAO report on the Columbia-class program stated the following: The Navy's $115 billion procurement cost estimate is not reliable partly because it is based on overly optimistic assumptions about the labor hours needed to construct the submarines.
At a March 27, 2019, hearing before the Seapower subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Navy shipbuilding programs, Navy officials testified that for the Columbia-class program, the Navy is implementing Continuous Production on selected shipyard-manufactured items to reduce cost and schedule risk and help strengthen the industrial base with a focus on critical vendors.
More generally, regarding the risk of delays in designing and building the lead boat, the April 2019 GAO report stated the following: The Navy's goal is to complete a significant amount of the Columbia class submarine's design—83 percent—before lead submarine construction begins in October 2020.
The program office stated that it intends to provide needed capabilities on schedule and at an affordable price by committing to stable requirements, achieving high design maturity at the start of construction for the lead submarine, improving manufacturing and construction readiness, and aggressively working to reduce costs.
To continue cost control, the Navy will focus on: • Stable operational and technical requirements • High design maturity at construction start • Detailed plans to ensure manufacturing readiness including robust prototyping efforts and synergies with other nuclear shipbuilding programs • Aggressive cost reduction actions Affordability caps have been assigned that are consistent with current cost estimates and reasonable margins for cost growth."
310,
311,"Some sources rely on ""head counts"" of employees (OPM), some on total hours worked (such as the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]), some on surveys of employing agencies, and others on self-identification by workers surveyed in their homes."
312,"Accordingly, the Court announced that ""Congress cannot circumvent"" the Constitution's prohibition against compelling states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory scheme ""by conscripting the State's officers directly."" But not every federal requirement imposed on the states necessarily violates the anti-commandeering principles identified in Printz and New York .
Further, the court added, ""informed, extensive, and cooperative interaction of a voluntary nature"" between states and federal authorities is an integral feature of the American system of dual sovereignty, and, in any event, the Supremacy Clause ""bars states from taking actions that frustrate federal laws and regulatory schemes."" Accordingly, the Second Circuit concluded that the Tenth Amendment does not provide states and municipalities with the ""untrammeled right to forbid all voluntary cooperation by state or local officials with particular federal programs."" The court therefore rejected New York City's constitutional challenge to the information-sharing provisions of PRWORA and IIRIRA, holding that that they did not violate the Tenth Amendment or principles of federalism.
Other lawsuits involve challenges to the Justice Department's decision, in implementing the executive order, to attach new conditions for grant eligibility under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) program and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, all of which are designed to encourage state and local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
Finally, this section discusses a lawsuit filed by the United States against California, claiming that three new state laws obstruct the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts and, as a result, violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause.
In the litigation challenging the EO's implementation, the various challengers have brought arguments raising similar statutory and constitutional concerns, chiefly: the DOJ lacked statutory authority to impose the new conditions; the DOJ imposed the conditions arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; the executive branch violated principles of separation of powers by usurping the legislature's spending power; and the government violated the anti-commandeering doctrine by unconstitutionally conscripting the states into federal immigration enforcement.
Chicago's suit challenged each of the three conditions that the Justice Department imposed for grant eligibility (compliance with the information-sharing requirements of Section 1373, DHS access to state and local detention facilities, and providing notice to DHS when an alien wanted for removal is released from custody).
Like Chicago, Philadelphia argued that the DOJ lacked statutory authority to impose the new conditions, violated constitutional principles of separation of powers, violated the Spending Clause, and unconstitutionally conscripted the states into federal immigration enforcement."
313,"Purpose of the NFIP In the original NFIP statute, Congress stipulated that ""a program of flood insurance can promote the public interest by providing appropriate protection against the perils of flood losses and encouraging sound land use by minimizing exposure of property to flood losses."" Congress had found that postdisaster flood losses, and the subsequent federal disaster relief assistance to help communities recover from those flood losses, had ""placed an increasing burden on the Nation's resources"" and that as a matter of national policy ""a reasonable method of sharing the risk of flood losses is through a program of flood insurance which can complement and encourage preventive and protective measures."" At the time of establishment of the NFIP, as is generally still the case today, it was found that ""many factors have made it uneconomic for the private insurance industry alone to make flood insurance available to those in need of such protection on reasonable terms and conditions."" Thus, the NFIP essentially has two interrelated policy purposes that can be summarized as 1.
Thus, communities that participate in the NFIP, and therefore whose residents may access the NFIP's primary flood insurance, also adopt through local or state laws minimum floodplain management standards that are described in FEMA regulations.
Reduction of Comprehensive Flood Risk The NFIP accomplishes the goal of reducing comprehensive flood risk primarily by requiring participating communities to Collaborate with FEMA to develop and adopt flood maps called Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs).
In particular, the TMAC is authorized to recommend to FEMA ""mapping standards and guidelines for—(A) flood insurance rate maps [FIRMs]; and (B) data accuracy, data quality, data currency, and data eligibility."" Currently, the TMAC estimates that the production of a new or revised FIRM is designed to take three to five years under the Risk MAP program, but can often take as long as six and a half years or longer.
Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) Coverage The NFIP requires most SFIP and PRP policyholders to purchase what is in effect a separate insurance policy to offset the expense of complying with more rigorous building code standards when local ordinances require them to do so.
Pre-FIRM Subsidy While most premium rates in the NFIP are intended to represent the full flood risk of a given structure, Congress has directed FEMA not to charge actuarial rates for properties that were constructed or substantially improved before December 31, 1974, or before the date upon which FEMA has published the first Flood Insurance Rate Map for the community, whichever was later."
314,"As such, the Administration's withdrawal from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), imposition of unilateral trade restrictions on various U.S. imports, renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), modification of certain provisions in the U.S.-South Korea (KORUS) free trade agreement (FTA), and launch of an extensive review of U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) were among the most notable developments in U.S. trade policy in the past two years.
Other issues before Congress included approving legislation to (1) strengthen the process used to review the national security implications of foreign direct investment transactions in the United States; (2) modernize U.S. development finance tools to help advance U.S. national security and economic interests and global influence; and (3) provide temporary tariff suspensions and reductions—through Miscellaneous Tariff Bills—on certain products not available domestically.
The implications of changes in the U.S. trade landscape for the 116 th Congress will depend on a number of factors, including the impact of the Administration's trade actions—particularly increased tariffs—on U.S. industries, firms, workers, and supply chains; the reaction of U.S. trading partners; and the extent to which future actions are in line with core U.S. commitments and obligations under the WTO and other trade agreements.
The 116 th Congress may consider (1) legislation to implement the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement; (2) measures to reassert its constitutional authority over tariffs and other trade restrictions or to narrow the scope of how the president can use delegated authorities to impose such restrictions; (3) the extent to which past U.S. FTAs should be modernized or revised and, if so, in what manner; (4) what priority should be given to negotiating new U.S. FTAs with the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and other trading partners, as well as the scope of negotiations; and (5) the impact of FTAs excluding the United States on U.S. economic and broader interests, and the appropriate U.S. response to the proliferation of such agreements.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which entered into force in 1994, was the first FTA that incorporated many of the rules in more recent U.S. FTAs. It initiated a new generation of U.S. trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world, influencing negotiations in areas such as market access, rules of origin, intellectual property rights (IPR), foreign investment, and dispute resolution.
Before voting on an agreement, Congress may review whether the objectives it set out in TPA legislation were followed in the negotiation of the agreement, evaluate the overall economic effect on the U.S. economy, including through a mandated report by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), determine whether the agreement would promote U.S. standards such as IPR, labor, and the environment in other countries, or consider the enforceability of the agreement and its rules.
Advocates of managed trade policies contend that, by negotiating results-oriented agreements and using the size of the U.S. economy as leverage, the United States can ensure that trade with certain trading partners is ""fair,"" ""balanced,"" and ""reciprocal."" In addition, they argue, it will force countries to change their distortive economic policies, decrease the size of the U.S. trade deficit and, by reducing U.S. imports, help strengthen certain U.S. industries and boost U.S. employment.
These include provisions in the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), U.S. participation in e-commerce negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO), evolving online privacy policies in the United States and other countries, as well as concerns about trade with China, such as those outlined in the Trump Administration's investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (see section on Tariff Actions by the Trump Administration).
Policy Issues for Congress Policy debates during the 116 th Congress may include the use and impact of unilateral tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration under various U.S. trade laws, as well as potential legislation that alters the authority granted by Congress to the President to do so; U.S.-China trade relations; legislation to implement the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA); and the Administration's launch of bilateral trade negotiations with the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom, among many others.
The executive branch has broad discretion in Section 232 cases to define the scope of the investigation, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) allows members to take measures in order to protect ""essential security interests."" Based on concerns about ongoing global overcapacity and certain trade practices, in April 2017, the Trump Administration initiated Section 232 investigations on U.S. steel and aluminum imports.
As Congress continues to debate the Administration's Section 232 actions, it may consider multiple issues including potential amendments to the delegation of constitutional authority that Congress gave to the President through Section 232, examining the investigation and implementation processes, and exploring opportunities to address specific market-distorting practices that are the root causes of steel and aluminum overcapacity through international forums and trade negotiations.
As other countries move forward with new FTA negotiations that cover a significant share of world trade, a number of issues arise that may be of interest to Congress, including how these agreements will affect U.S. economic and strategic interests, their impact on U.S. leadership in trade liberalization efforts and establishing new trade rules, and the appropriate U.S. response.
The U.S. Ambassador to the WTO claims that the proposals ""instead appear to endorse changing the rules to accommodate and authorize the very approaches that have given rise to Members' concerns."" Challenges and Future Direction101 The United States has historically served as a leader in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and many U.S. firms rely on WTO rules to open markets for imports and exports, eliminate discriminatory treatment, and defend and advance U.S. economic interests.
Traditionally, the United States has supported a rules-based open and liberalized investment environment, including by negotiating rules, disciplines, and market access commitments in trade agreements and administering investment promotion programs, while also reviewing certain proposed inbound foreign investment transactions for U.S. national security implications."
315,"Two issues that often underlie these sentiments are (1) the ability of digital economy MNCs to provide services without establishing a physical presence (or ""permanent establishment"") in the country in which their customers reside and (2) the ability of digital economy MNCs to shift their profits away from countries where they conduct real economy activity (e.g., sales, development, production) toward low-tax jurisdictions where the MNCs are conducting little to no real economic activity.
MNCs in the digital economy, in particular, can use transfer pricing strategies to reduce the effective tax rate imposed on their cross-border income, because their primary sources of income are often derived from intangible assets (e.g., patents, algorithms, trademarks, and marketing licenses).
The exact tax planning methods used by MNCs can vary, but generally they involve the parent (e.g., located in the United States) selling the income-earning ownership rights to those intangible assets to a subsidiary corporation in a low-tax jurisdiction.
This user-created value argument, discussed more throughout this report, has been used by many proponents of DSTs. A second perspective is that the challenges of tax policy presented by the digital economy are not exclusive to specific business models and should be addressed within the existing international tax framework for business profits.
The first proposal would expand the definition of permanent establishment to include cases where a company had significant economic activity through a ""digital presence,"" thereby allowing EU members to tax profits that are generated in their jurisdiction even if a firm does not have a physical presence.
Until that more systemic change in permanent establishment rules is adopted, the second proposal would impose an ""interim tax"" on certain revenue from digital activities: selling online advertising, online marketplaces (facilitating the buying and selling of goods and services between users), and sales of data generated from user-provided information.
As explained in the ""Economic Efficiency"" section of this report, the economic incidence of a DST is likely to be borne by purchasers of taxable services (e.g., companies paying digital economy firms for advertising, marketplace listings, or user data) and possibly consumers downstream from those transactions, depending on supply-and-demand conditions in each stage of the supply chain.
In other words, if U.S. corporations are largely the center of concerns about digital economy MNCs not paying a ""fair share"" of their worldwide profits in tax, then GILTI provides a ""floor"" in the amount of tax owed by firms that previously sought out tax homes for their intangible assets in countries that imposed low or zero income tax.
Some European countries have taken efforts to change policies that were characterized by some as enabling tax avoidance among digital economy MNCs. For example, Ireland is phasing out tax provisions by 2020 behind the ""double Irish sandwich."" Some digital economy firms reportedly used this tax planning strategy to reduce the effective rate of tax on their cross-border income (e.g., advertising sales in Europe) and shift their profits to ""tax havens"" that impose no tax on corporate income."
316,"Annual Appropriations to Conduct APHIS Health Import Permit Activities Overall, the House and Senate Agriculture Committees maintain jurisdiction over USDA's meat and poultry inspection programs and also other food-safety-related programs administered by other USDA agencies.
This oversight has manifest in various congressional actions, including continuing to provide APHIS with appropriations to monitor pests and diseases, introducing legislation to address invasive species (e.g., Areawide Integrated Pest Management, H.R. 5411 , 115 th Congress), and directing CBP to enforce APHIS regulations to deter agricultural smuggling into the United States."

318,"It examines historical and recent trends in aid to the region; the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request for aid administered by the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Inter-American Foundation; and FY2019 foreign aid appropriations legislation.
Foreign Assistance Categories and Accounts7 About $515.9 million (46%) of the Administration's proposed FY2019 foreign aid budget for Latin America and the Caribbean was requested through a new Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF).
In recent years, Congress has appropriated most aid for Latin America and the Caribbean through foreign assistance accounts that provide the State Department and USAID with up to two fiscal years to obligate the funds and an additional four years to expend them."
319,"A Public Works Subcommittee (including the Army civil functions as well as the Atomic Energy Commission, Bureau of Reclamation, and power marketing administrations) was established by both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees beginning in the first session of the 84 th Congress (1955).
The two chambers subsequently returned to the former practice of a separate Legislative Subcommittee, with judiciary matters being considered by the same subcommittee as the Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce beginning in the first session of the 84 th Congress (1955).
The Senate Appropriations Committee subsequently adopted a reorganization plan as well, eliminating the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies and making the following major changes: Jurisdiction over Veterans Affairs was transferred to the Subcommittee on Military Construction."
320,"The Community Development Venture Capital Demonstration Program The amendment, offered by Senator Paul Wellstone, would have authorized a $20 million, four-year technical assistance program—the Community Development Venture Capital Demonstration Program—to provide grants, on a matching dollar-to-dollar basis, to experienced community development venture capital (CDVC) firms that invest in small businesses located in economically distressed areas, such as inner cities and poor rural counties.
NMVC Company Eligibility and Performance Requirements P.L. 106-554 specified that venture capital companies interested in participating in the program must submit  a detailed application to the SBA that includes, among other items, a business plan describing how the company intends to make successful developmental venture capital investments in identified low-income geographic areas, and information regarding the community development finance or relevant venture capital qualifications and general reputation of the company's management.
Legislative Efforts to Provide Additional NMVC Funding As shown in Table A-1 in the Appendix , during the 108 th Congress, two bills were introduced, one in the House and one in the Senate, to provide the NMVC program ""such subsidy budget authority as may be necessary to guarantee $75 million of debentures"" and $15 million for operational assistance grants over FY2004 and FY2005."
321,"The House's decision to resort to criminal contempt of Congress and civil enforcement in these cases was not without controversy, as in each instance the executive official asserted that a constitutional privilege limited Congress's right to the information sought.
Based on both statutory interpretation and the constitutional separation of powers, the OLC concluded that (1) Congress ""may not direct the Executive to prosecute a particular individual without leaving any discretion to the Executive to determine whether a violation of the law has occurred,"" and (2) ""the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege .
§ 194 as requiring the executive branch to bring a criminal contempt prosecution under these circumstances would ""burden"" and ""nullif[y]"" the President's exercise of executive privilege, and impermissibly interfere with the ""prosecutorial discretion of the Executive by directing the executive branch to prosecute particular individuals."" The Miers and Bolten Contempts In 2007, former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten failed to comply with subpoenas issued by the House Judiciary Committee for testimony and documents relating to the dismissal of various United States Attorneys during the George W.
After failed negotiations, the House held both individuals in criminal contempt of Congress and—presumably in response to the position taken by the DOJ in the Burford contempt—simultaneously approved a separate resolution authorizing the Judiciary Committee to initiate a civil lawsuit in federal court to enforce the subpoenas.
The House held the Attorney General in criminal contempt of Congress and simultaneously passed a resolution authorizing the committee to enforce the subpoena in federal court.
Ultimately, the House adopted a resolution citing Ms. Lerner for criminal contempt of Congress, but did not choose to approve a resolution authorizing the committee to pursue civil enforcement of the subpoena in federal court, as had been done in 2008 with Ms. Miers and 2012 with Attorney General Holder.
For example, while the Miers decision rejected absolute immunity for senior presidential advisers and may have removed a barrier to Congress's access to such testimony in the future, the district court opinions in the Fast and Furious litigation may have more limiting effect on congressional efforts to access testimony by certain executive branch officials, because the court recognized that the deliberative process privilege has constitutional roots and must be balanced against Congress's need for the information.
Bicameralism and Presentment Finally, because the power to seek enforcement of a congressional subpoena is independently vested in each house, rather than in Congress as a whole, constitutional questions may be raised over whether a single house, through approval of a contempt resolution, can trigger legal consequences or impose requirements upon the executive branch without compliance with bicameralism and presentment."
322,"Upon enactment, FIRRMA: (1) expanded the scope and jurisdiction of CFIUS by redefining such terms as ""covered transactions"" and ""critical technologies""; (2) refined CFIUS procedures, including timing for reviews and investigations; and (3) required actions by CFIUS to address national security risks related to mitigation agreements, among other areas.
In addition, FIRRMA: provides for CFIUS to review any noncontrolling investment in U.S. businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, or collecting sensitive data on U.S. citizens; any change in foreign investor rights; transactions in which a foreign government has a direct or indirect substantial interest; and any transaction or arrangement designed to evade CFIUS.
Through a ""sense of Congress"" provision in FIRRMA, CFIUS reviews potentially can discriminate among investors from certain countries that are determined to be a country of ""special concern"" (specified through additional regulations) that has a ""demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect U.S. leadership in areas related to national security."" Foreign Investment Data Information on international investment and production collected and published by the United Nations indicates that global annual inflows of FDI peaked in 2015, surpassing the previous record set in 2007, but has fallen since, as indicated in Figure 1 .
In general, FIRRMA: Broaden s the scope of transactions under CFIUS ' purview by including for review real estate transactions in close proximity to a military installation or U.S. Government facility or property of national security sensitivities; any nonpassive investment in a critical industry or critical technologies; any change in foreign investor rights regarding a U.S. business; transactions in which a foreign government has a direct or indirect substantial interest; and any transaction or arrangement designed to evade CFIUS regulations.
This shift was precipitated by concerns that investments in which foreign firms have a noncontrolling interest could nevertheless ""affect certain decisions made by, or obtain certain information from, a U.S. business with respect to the use, development, acquisition, or release of critical technology."" New authorities granted by FIRRMA for CFIUS to review noncontrolling investments were not immediately effective upon passage of the Act, but were included as part of the Treasury Department's pilot program.
In addition, in reviewing a covered transaction, Congress directed that CFIUS and the President ""may"" consider the following: the control of United States industries and commercial activity by foreign persons as it affects the capability and capacity of the United States to meet the requirements of national security, including the availability of human resources, products, technology, materials, and other supplies and services, and in considering ''the availability of human resources,'' should construe that term to include potential losses of such availability resulting from reductions in the employment of United States persons whose knowledge or skills are critical to national security, including the continued production in the United States of items that are likely to be acquired by the Department of Defense or other Federal departments or agencies for the advancement of the national security of the United States; and the extent to which a covered transaction is likely to expose, either directly or indirectly, personally identifiable information, genetic information, or other sensitive data of United States citizens to access by a foreign government or foreign person that may exploit that information in a manner that threatens national security .
FIRRMA also expanded CFIUS reviews to include unaffiliated businesses that may be affected by a foreign investment transaction if the business: (1) owns, operates, manufactures, supplies, or services critical infrastructure; (2) produces, designs, tests, manufactures, fabricates, or develops one or more critical technologies; or (3) maintains or collects sensitive personal data of United States citizens that may be exploited in a manner that threatens national security.
CFIUS has indicated that in order to ensure an unimpeded inflow of foreign investment it would implement the statute ""only insofar as necessary to protect the national security,"" and ""in a manner fully consistent with the international obligations of the United States."" FIRRMA defines the term control to mean: ""the power, direct or indirect, whether exercised or not exercised, to determine, direct, or decide important matters affecting an entity, subject to regulations prescribed by the Committee."" Also, Congress added six additional factors through FIRRMA that CFIUS and the President ""may"" consider in reviewing investment transactions, including the fourth factor, as indicated in the section below on factors for consideration."
323,"Other important changes from NAFTA include the agreement between the three countries—Canada, Mexico, and the United States—to further harmonize trade in products of agricultural biotechnology and apply the same health, safety, and marketing standards to agricultural and food imports from USMCA partners as for domestic products.
Expansion of Market Access Provisions As agreed upon by the leaders of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, all food and agricultural products that have zero tariffs under NAFTA would remain at zero under USMCA.
As for U.S.-Mexico trade in agricultural products, under NAFTA, Mexico eliminated all the tariffs and quotas that formerly governed agricultural imports from the United States, and the proposed USMCA provides for no further market access changes for imports by Mexico of U.S. agricultural products."
324,"In the joint statement released after their December 4 meeting, NATO Foreign Ministers stated that they ""strongly support the finding … that Russia is in material breach of its obligations under the INF Treaty."" In a statement released on February 1, 2019, the North Atlantic Council noted that Russia had ""taken no demonstrable steps toward returning to full and verifiable compliance"" and that ""Russia will bear sole responsibility for the end of the Treaty."" At the same time, the statement noted that the ""allies are firmly committed to the preservation of effective international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation"" and ""will continue to uphold, support, and further strengthen arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security."" Introduction The Russian Violation In July 2014, the State Department released the 2014 edition of its report Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments .
This report stated that the United States had determined that ""the Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the [1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces] INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles."" The report did not offer any details about the offending missile or cite the evidence that the United States used to make this determination, but it did note that the United States ""raised these concerns with the Russian Federation"" several times during 2013 and ""will continue to pursue resolution"" of the issue.
But he noted that ""Russia then tested the same missile at ranges below 500 kilometers from a mobile launcher."" He then noted that ""by putting the two types of tests together"" Russia developed an INF-range missile that could be launched from a ""ground-mobile platform."" The DNI's timeline confirmed press reports that had indicated that the United States identified Russian activities that raised INF compliance concerns as early as 2008 and that the Obama Administration began to mention these concerns to Members of Congress in late 2011.
He indicated that U.S. missile sites on allied territory could become ""the targets of subsequent military exchanges."" The U.S. Reaction Obama Administration officials often stated that the INF Treaty remained in the security interest of the United States and its allies, and that the U.S. goal is to ""to work to bring Russia back in to full compliance."" However, because Russia was unwilling to address U.S. concerns or even acknowledge the existence of the offending cruise missile, the United States reviewed a broad range of economic and military options that might both provide an incentive for Russia to return to compliance with the treaty and provide the United States with the capability to counter Russian actions if it does not return to compliance.
He stated that Russia's violation of the treaty ""increases the risk to our allies and poses a threat to U.S. forces and interests."" He also noted that Russia's violation, if allowed to stand, ""could erode the foundations of all current and future arms control agreements and initiatives."" At the same time, he stated that the violation would not provide Russia with a ""significant military advantage,"" although, if Russia chooses to ""act as an adversary, we must respond appropriately and in league with our allies."" Further, he echoed the Obama Administration's view that ""returning to compliance is in Russia's best interest."" Secretary Mattis reaffirmed this goal in November 2017, after a meeting with NATO defense ministers.
Secretary Mattis offered a more blunt assessment prior to the NATO meeting of defense ministers in October 2018, when he stated that ""the current situation, with Russia in blatant violation of this treaty, is untenable."" He also said that ""Russia must return to compliance with the INF Treaty or the U.S. will need to match its capabilities to protect U.S. and NATO interests."" Press reports indicated that the Trump Administration was moving forward with efforts to begin research and development into a new U.S. ground-launched cruise missile of INF range.
As the State Department noted, the participants agreed that ""the INF Treaty continues to play an important role in the existing system of international security, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and that they will work to preserve and strengthen it."" But, according to some reports, Russia continued to deny that the 9M729 ground-based cruise missile had ever been tested to INF range or that telemetry from the tests supported a conclusion that it violated the INF Treaty.
If the President makes this determination, the bill states that the INF Treaty's ban on intermediate-range missiles will ""no longer be binding on the United States as a matter of United States law."" The Senate bill (§1635) did not use the phrase ""program of record"" in its response to Russia's INF violation, but stated that DOD should establish ""a research and development program for a dual-capable road-mobile ground-launched missile system with a maximum range of 5,500 kilometers."" The Senate also required a report on the feasibility of modifying other missile systems and mandates that the costs and feasibility of these modifications be compared to the costs and feasibility of a new ground-launched cruise missile.
As a result, it stated that it was the sense of Congress that the United States ""is legally entitled to suspend the operation of the INF Treaty."" The House version of the FY2019 NDAA ( H.R. 5515 ) had included this language as a ""statement of policy"" rather than a ""sense of Congress."" The change in language in the final version of the bill indicates that the President, not Congress, would make the determination of a ""material breach."" The legislation also stated that the United States should ""take actions to encourage the Russian Federation to return to compliance"" by providing additional funds for the development of military capabilities needed to counter Russia's new cruise missile and by ""seeking additional missile defense assets … to protect United States and NATO forces"" from Russia's noncompliant ground-launched missile systems.
In late November 2018, several Senators—led by Senators Merkley, Warren, Gillibrand, and Markey—introduced a bill that would prohibit funding for a new INF-range cruise missile or ballistic missile until the Trump Administration submitted a report that, among other things, identified a U.S. ally formally willing to host such a system on its territory; detailed recent diplomatic efforts to bring Russia back into compliance with the treaty; and assessed the risk to U.S. and allied security of if Russia deployed greater numbers of intermediate range missiles.
These bills called on the President to ""carry out a program to research and develop ground-launched cruise missile and ground-launched ballistic missile capabilities, including by modification of existing United States military capabilities, with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers."" The legislation also called on the President to study potential sites for the deployment of these new systems and to ""consider selecting sites on United States overseas military bases and sites offered by United States allies."" The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 3979 , §1651) also called on the Pentagon to submit a report to Congress that described steps that it plans to take in response to Russia's violation of the INF Treaty."
325,"Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments.
H.R. 2807 , the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF when its investment authority expired on September 27, 2011, to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund ""to continue the program of making capital investments in eligible community development financial institutions in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses."" H.R. 3147 , the Small Business Lending Extension Act, would have, among other provisions, extended the Department of the Treasury's investment authority from one year following the date of enactment to two years.
The SBLF The SBLF was designed ""to address the ongoing effects of the financial crisis on small businesses by providing temporary authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to make capital investments in eligible institutions in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses."" The SBLF's legislative history, including differences in the House- and Senate-passed versions of the program, appears in the Appendix .
For example, during any calendar quarter in the initial two years of the capital investments under the program, the bank's dividend rate is lowered if it increases its small business lending, as reported in its FDIC call reports, compared with the average small business lending it made in the four previous quarters immediately preceding the law's enactment, minus some allowable adjustments.
The act directed that all funds received by the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with purchases made by the SBLF, ""including interest payments, dividend payments, and proceeds from the sale of any financial instrument, shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt."" Arguments For and Against the SBLF The SBLF's advocates argued that it would create jobs by encouraging lenders, especially those experiencing liquidity problems (access to cash and easily tradable assets), to increase their lending to small businesses.
For example, Representative Melissa Bean advocated the bill's passage, arguing that the SBLF  builds on the effective financial stabilization measures Congress has previously taken by establishing a new $30 billion small business loan fund to provide additional capital to community banks that increase lending to small businesses."
326,"U.S. Policy Most U.S. policymakers have generally supported the Council's overall purpose and mandate; however, many have expressed concern regarding its effectiveness in addressing human rights issues—leading to ongoing disagreements as to whether or not the United States should be a member of or provide funding for the Council.
Specifically, some Members of the 115 th Congress introduced legislation addressing a range of issues, including expressing concern with the Council's focus on Israel, seeking to defund or withdraw from the Council, and calling on the Council to take action on specific human rights situations."
327,"To enable international data flows and trade, the United States has aimed to eliminate trade barriers and establish enforceable international rules and best practices that allow policymakers to achieve public policy objectives, including promoting online security and privacy.
Other countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade as some governments or groups seek to limit data flows outside of an organization or across national borders for a number of reasons.
WTO Plurilateral Effort In December 2017, a group of more than 70 WTO members, including the United States, agreed to ""initiate exploratory work together toward future WTO negotiations on trade-related aspects of electronic commerce."" Overall U.S. objectives include allowing the free flow of information for international trade and cross-border data flows, ""subject to reasonable safeguards like the protection of consumer data when it is exported,"" but do not specifically address privacy.
G-20 Building on the OECD principles and prior G-20 work, the 2018 G-20 Digital Economy Ministerial Declaration identified principles to ""facilitate an inclusive and whole-of-government approach to the use of information and communication technology (ICT) and assist governments in reshaping their capacities and strategies, while respecting the applicable frameworks of different countries, including with regards to privacy and data protection.""  Japan is to host the 2019 G-20 and plans to focus on data governance, offering a forum to address potential global standards on privacy and cross-border data flows.
In addition, USTR's specific trade negotiating objectives for future agreements with the EU and Japan include establishing rules to protect cross-border data flows."
328,"In addition, an IHE must satisfy the program integrity triad, under which it must be legally authorized to provide a postsecondary education in the state in which it is located; accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized by the Department of Education (ED) for such purposes, and certified by ED as eligible to participate in Title IV programs.
Section 101 Institution of Higher Education To be considered a Section 101 IHE, public and private nonprofit educational institutions must admit as regular students only individuals with a high school diploma or its equivalent, individuals beyond the age of compulsory school attendance, or individuals who are dually or concurrently enrolled in both the institution and in a secondary school; be legally authorized to provide a postsecondary education within the state in which they are located; offer a bachelor's degree, provide a program of at least two-years that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree, award a degree that is accepted for admission to a graduate or professional program, or provide a training program of at least a one-year that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation; and be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED to grant accreditation or preaccreditation status Section 102 Institutions Section 102 of the HEA defines IHE only for the purposes of Title IV participation.
Postsecondary Vocational Institutions HEA Section 102 defines a postsecondary vocational institution as a public or private nonprofit institution that provides an eligible program of training ""to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation,"" and has been legally authorized to provide (and has continuously been providing) the same or a substantially similar educational program for at least two consecutive years.
In addition, all types of institutions (including public and private nonprofit institutions) must meet requirements related to the course of study offered at the institution and student enrollment to be considered Title IV eligible under Section 102.
Public and Private Nonprofit Institutions of Higher Education At a public or private nonprofit IHE, the following types of programs are Title IV eligible: (1) programs that lead to an associate's, bachelor's, professional, or graduate degree; (2) transfer programs that are at least two academic years in length and for which the institution does not award a credential but that are acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree; (3) programs that lead to a certificate or other recognized nondegree credential, that prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, and that are at least one academic year in length; (4) certificate or diploma training programs that are less than one year in length, if the institution also meets the definition of a postsecondary vocational institution; and (5) programs consisting of courses required for elementary or secondary teacher certification in the state in which the student intends to teach."
329,"The tax expenditure data provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are estimates of federal revenue losses associated with specific provisions.

330,"Introduction The U.S.-Mexico bilateral economic relationship is of key interest to the United States because of Mexico's proximity, the extensive cultural and economic ties between the two countries, and the strong economic relationship with Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Congress has maintained an active interest on issues related to NAFTA renegotiations and the recently signed U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA); U.S.-Mexico trade and investment relations; Mexico's economic reform measures, especially in the energy sector; the Mexican 2018 presidential elections; U.S.-Mexico border management; and other related issues.
This report provides an overview and background information regarding U.S.-Mexico economic relations, trade trends, the Mexican economy, NAFTA, the proposed USMCA, and trade issues between the United States and Mexico.
Through NAFTA, the United States, Mexico, and Canada form one of the world's largest free trade areas, with about one-third of the world's total gross domestic product (GDP).
The OECD outlook for Mexico for 2018 states that there are some encouraging signs for potential economic growth, including improvements in fiscal performance, responsible and reliable monetary policy to curb inflation, growth in manufacturing exports and inflows of foreign direct investment, and positive developments due to government reforms in telecommunications, energy, labor, education, and other structural reforms.
These issues have involved trade in sugar, country of origin labeling, tomato imports from Mexico, dolphin-safe tuna labeling, and NAFTA trucking provisions.
The United States claims its actions are due to national security concerns; however, Mexico contends that U.S. tariffs are meant to protect domestic industries from import competition and are inconsistent with the World Trade Organization (WTO) Safeguard Agreement.
The agreements suspending the investigations alter the nature of trade in sugar between Mexico and the United States by (1) imposing volume limits on U.S. sugar imports from Mexico and (2) setting minimum price levels on Mexican sugar.
It imposed antidumping duties for some time, until NAFTA and WTO dispute resolution panels upheld U.S. claims that the Mexican government colluded with the Mexican sugar and sweetener industries to restrict HFCS imports from the United States.
A significant milestone in implementation of U.S. NAFTA commitments occurred on January 9, 2015, when the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced that Mexican motor carriers would be allowed to conduct long-haul, cross-border trucking services in the United States."
331,"The term exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) dispute is used in this report to refer to a dispute principally between China and the United States over whether coastal states have a right under international law to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating in their EEZs. Background U.S. Interests in SCS and ECS Although maritime territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS involving China and its neighbors may appear at first glance to be disputes between faraway countries over a few rocks and reefs in the ocean that are of seemingly little importance to the United States, the situation in the SCS and ECS can engage U.S. interests for a variety of strategic, political, and economic reasons, including but not necessarily limited to those discussed in the sections below.
Short of a conflict with the United States, Chinese bases in the SCS, and more generally, Chinese domination over or control of its near-seas region could help China to do one or more of the following on a day-to-day basis: control fishing operations and oil and gas exploration activities in the SCS; coerce, intimidate, or put political pressure on other countries bordering on the SCS; announce and enforce an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the SCS; announce and enforce a maritime exclusion zone (i.e., a blockade) around Taiwan; facilitate the projection of Chinese military presence and political influence further into the Western Pacific; and help achieve a broader goal of becoming a regional hegemon in its part of Eurasia.
In light of some of the preceding points, Chinese bases in the SCS, and more generally, Chinese domination over or control of its near-seas region could complicate the ability of the United States to intervene militarily in a crisis or conflict between China and Taiwan; fulfill U.S. obligations under U.S defense treaties with Japan and the Philippines and South Korea; operate U.S. forces in the Western Pacific for various purposes, including maintaining regional stability, conducting engagement and partnership-building operations, responding to crises, and executing war plans; and prevent the emergence of China as a regional hegemon in its part of Eurasia.
Significant portions of the world's oceans are claimable as EEZs, including high-priority U.S. Navy operating areas in the Western Pacific, the Persian Gulf, and the Mediterranean Sea. The legal right of U.S. naval forces to operate freely in EEZ waters—an application of the principle of freedom of the seas—is important to their ability to perform many of their missions around the world, because many of those missions are aimed at influencing events ashore, and having to conduct operations from more than 200 miles offshore would reduce the inland reach and responsiveness of ship-based sensors, aircraft, and missiles, and make it more difficult to transport Marines and their equipment from ship to shore.
Dispute Regarding China's Rights within Its EEZ, and Associated U.S.-Chinese Incidents at Sea In addition to maritime territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS, China is involved in a dispute, principally with the United States, over whether China has a right under international law to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating within China's EEZ.
The position of China and some other countries (i.e., a minority group among the world's nations) is that UNCLOS gives coastal states the right to regulate not only economic activities, but also foreign military activities, in their EEZs. In response to a request from CRS to identify the countries taking this latter position, the U.S. Navy states that countries with restrictions inconsistent with the Law of the Sea Convention [i.e., UNCLOS] that would limit the exercise of high seas freedoms by foreign navies beyond 12 nautical miles from the coast are [the following 27]: Bangladesh, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, Cape Verde, China, Egypt, Haiti, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, North Korea, Pakistan, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Vietnam.
Other observers provide different counts of the number of countries that take the position that UNCLOS gives coastal states the right to regulate not only economic activities but also foreign military activities in their EEZs. For example, one set of observers, in an August 2013 briefing, stated that 18 countries seek to regulate foreign military activities in their EEZs, and that 3 of these countries—China, North Korea, and Peru—have directly interfered with foreign military activities in their EEZs. The dispute over whether China has a right under UNCLOS to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating within its EEZ appears to be at the heart of incidents between Chinese and U.S. ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace, including incidents in March 2001, September 2002, March 2009, and May 2009, in which Chinese ships and aircraft confronted and harassed the U.S. naval ships Bowditch , Impeccable , and Victorious as they were conducting survey and ocean surveillance operations in China's EEZ; an incident on April 1, 2001, in which a Chinese fighter collided with a U.S. Navy EP-3 electronic surveillance aircraft flying in international airspace about 65 miles southeast of China's Hainan Island in the South China Sea, forcing the EP-3 to make an emergency landing on Hainan Island; an incident on December 5, 2013, in which a Chinese navy ship put itself in the path of the U.S. Navy cruiser Cowpens as it was operating 30 or more miles from China's aircraft carrier Liaoning , forcing the Cowpens to change course to avoid a collision; an incident on August 19, 2014, in which a Chinese fighter conducted an aggressive and risky intercept of a U.S. Navy P-8 maritime patrol aircraft that was flying in international airspace about 135 miles east of Hainan Island —DOD characterized the intercept as ""very, very close, very dangerous""; and an incident on May 17, 2016, in which Chinese fighters flew within 50 feet of a Navy EP-3 electronic surveillance aircraft in international airspace in the South China Sea—a maneuver that DOD characterized as ""unsafe.""  Figure 2 shows the locations of the 2001, 2002, and 2009 incidents listed in the first two bullets above.
An August 12, 2015, press report states the following (emphasis added): China respects freedom of navigation in the disputed South China Sea but will not allow any foreign government to invoke that right so its military ships and planes can intrude in Beijing's territory, the Chinese ambassador [to the Philippines] said.
July 2018 Press Report Regarding Chinese Radio Warnings A July 31, 2018, press report stated the following: The Philippines has expressed concern to China over an increasing number of Chinese radio messages warning Philippine aircraft and ships to stay away from newly fortified islands and other territories in the South China Sea claimed by both countries, officials said Monday.
U.S. Position on Maritime Disputes in SCS and ECS Some Key Elements The U.S. position on territorial and EEZ disputes in the Western Pacific (including those involving China) includes the following elements, among others: The United States supports the principle that disputes between countries should be resolved peacefully, without coercion, intimidation, threats, or the use of force, and in a manner consistent with international law.
DOD's record of ""excessive maritime claims that were challenged by DoD operational assertions and activities during the period of October 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017, in order to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law"" includes a listing for multiple challenges that were conducted to challenge Chinese claims relating to ""excessive straight baselines; jurisdiction over airspace above the exclusive economic zone (EEZ); restriction on foreign aircraft flying through an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) without the intent to enter national airspace; domestic law criminalizing survey activity by foreign entities in the EEZ; prior permission required for innocent passage of foreign military ships through the TTS; and actions/statements that indicate a claim to a TTS [territorial sea] around features not so entitled."" Assessments of China's Strengthening Position in SCS Some observers now assess that China's actions in the SCS have achieved for China a more dominant or more commanding position in the SCS.
China's attempts to restrict the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea available to naval and air forces is inconsistent with customary international law and as President Reagan said in the 1983 Statement on United States Oceans Policy, ""the United States will not, however, acquiesce in unilateral acts of other states designed to restrict the rights and freedoms of the international community in navigation and overflight."" A May 8, 2018, press report states the following: China's neighbors and rivals fear that the Asian powerhouse is slowly but surely establishing the foundation of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in one of the world's most important and busy waterways….
A June 1, 2018, press report states the following: Through its navy, coast guard, a loose collection of armed fishing vessels, and a network of military bases built on artificial islands, Beijing has gained de facto control of the South China Sea, a panel of Indo-Pacific security experts said Friday.
Potential U.S. Goals General Goals Potential general U.S. goals in responding to China's actions in the SCS and ECS include but are not necessarily limited to the following, which are not mutually exclusive: fulfilling U.S. security commitments in the Western Pacific, including treaty commitments to Japan and the Philippines; maintaining and enhancing the U.S.-led security architecture in the Western Pacific, including U.S. security relationships with treaty allies and partner states; maintaining a regional balance of power that is favorable to the United States and its allies and partners; de fending the principle of peaceful resolution of disputes , under which disputes between countries should be resolved peacefully, without coercion, intimidation, threats, or the use of force, and in a manner consistent with international law, and resisting the emergence of an alternative ""might-makes-right"" approach to international affairs; defending the principle of freedom of the seas , meaning the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations in international law, including the interpretation held by the United States and many other countries concerning operational freedoms for military forces in EEZs; and preventing China from becoming a regional hegemon in East Asia, and potentially as part of that, preventing China from controlling or dominating the ECS or SCS.
U.S. Actions During Obama Administration In apparent response to China's actions in the SCS and ECS, the United States during the Obama Administration took a number of actions, including the following: reiterating the U.S. position on maritime territorial claims in the area in various public fora; expressing strong concerns about China's island-building and base-construction activities, and calling for a halt on such activities by China and other countries in the region; taking steps to improve the ability of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia to maintain maritime domain awareness (MDA) and patrol their EEZs, including the Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative (MSI), an initiative (since renamed the Indo-Pacific MSI) announced by the Obama Administration in May 2015 and subsequently legislated by Congress to provide $425 million in maritime security assistance to those four countries over a five-year period; taking steps to strengthen U.S. security cooperation with Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore, including signing an agreement with the Philippines that provides U.S. forces with increased access to Philippine bases, increasing the scale of joint military exercises involving U.S. and Philippine forces, relaxing limits on sales of certain U.S. arms to Vietnam, and operating U.S. Navy P-8 maritime patrol aircraft from Singapore; expressing support for the idea of Japanese patrols in the SCS; and stating that the United States would support a multinational maritime patrol of the SCS by members of ASEAN.
In particular, they have argued that the Obama Administration did not react strongly enough to China's occupation of Scarborough Shoal in 2012; react strongly enough to China's island-building and base-construction activities in the Spratly Islands starting around December 2013; do enough in terms of conducting and offering sufficiently clear and strong legal rationales for U.S. freedom of navigation (FON) operations in the SCS; do enough to publicize, rhetorically support, and enforce the July 2016 tribunal award in the SCS arbitration case involving the Philippines and China; and impose sufficiently strong costs on China's for its actions in the SCS and ECS.
A May 23, 2018, press report states the following: The Pentagon rescinded an invitation to China to participate in an international military exercise in the Pacific Ocean next month, signaling disapproval to Beijing for what U.S. officials say is its refusal to stop militarizing South China Sea islands.
November 13, 2018, Statement Opposing Agreements Limiting Freedom of Navigation A November 13, 2018, press report states the following: National security adviser John Bolton said [on November 13] the U.S. would oppose any agreements between China and other claimants to the South China Sea that limit free passage to international shipping, and that American naval vessels would continue to sail through those waters.
Supporters argued that not conducting such an operation was inconsistent with the underlying premise of the U.S. FON program that navigational rights which are not regularly exercised are at risk of atrophy; that it was inconsistent with the U.S. position of taking no position on competing claims to sovereignty over disputed land features in the SCS (because it tacitly accepts Chinese sovereignty over those features); that it effectively rewarded (rather than imposed costs on) China for its assertive actions in the SCS, potentially encouraging further such actions; and that China intends to militarize its occupied sites in the Spratly Islands, regardless of whether the United States conducts FON operations there.
The U.S. Pacific Command has developed a plan to conduct so-called freedom-of-navigation operations two to three times over the next few months, according to several U.S. officials, reinforcing the U.S. challenge to what it sees as excessive Chinese maritime claims in the disputed South China Sea. Beijing claims sovereignty over all South China Sea islands and their adjacent waters.
Likewise, artificial islands and installations also generate no maritime zones of sovereignty or sovereign rights in international law, although the owner of features may maintain a 500-meter vessel traffic management zone to ensure navigational safety."" Regarding features in the water whose sovereignty has been resolved and which do qualify for a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea, "" Warships and commercial vessels of all nations are entitled to conduct transit in innocent passage in the territorial sea of a rock or island of a coastal state, although aircraft do not enjoy such a right."" These three legal points appear to create at least four options for the rationale to cite as the legal basis for conducting an FON operation within 12 miles of Chinese-occupied sites in the SCS: One option would be to state that since there is a dispute as to the sovereignty of the site or sites in question, that site or those sites are terra nullius , that the United States consequently is not obligated to observe requirements of a theoretical territorial sea, and that U.S. warships thus have a right to transit within 12 nautical miles of the site or sites as an exercise of high seas freedom under article 87 of the Law of the Sea Convention.
This transit cuts through the diplomatic dissembling that obfuscates the legal seascape and is the most tangible expression of the U.S. view that the arbitration ruling is ""final and binding."" Regarding this same FON operation, two other observers stated the following: The Dewey's action evidently challenged China's right to control maritime zones adjacent to the reef—which was declared by the South China Sea arbitration to be nothing more than a low tide elevation on the Philippine continental shelf.
In general, actions proposed by these observers include (but are not limited to) the following: making a statement (analogous to the one that U.S. leaders have made concerning the Senkaku islands and the U.S.-Japan treaty on mutual cooperation and security) that clarifies what the United States would do under the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty in the event of certain Chinese actions at Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal, or elsewhere in the SCS; further increasing and/or accelerating actions to strengthen the capacity of allied and partner countries in the region to maintain maritime domain awareness (MDA) and defend their maritime claims by conducting coast guard and/or navy patrols of claimed areas; further increasing U.S. Navy operations in the region, including sending U.S. Navy ships more frequently to waters within 12 nautical miles of Chinese-occupied sites in the SCS, and conducting FON operations in the SCS jointly with navy ships of U.S. allies; further strengthening U.S. security cooperation with allied and partner countries in the region, and with India, to the point of creating a coalition for balancing China's assertiveness; and taking additional actions to impose costs on China for its actions in its near-seas region, such as inviting Taiwan to participate in the 2018 RIMPAC exercise."

334,"Workers Excluded by Statute Sections 2(3) and 3(b) of the LHWCA exclude the following workers from coverage: Workers covered by a state workers' compensation law, including employees exclusively engaged in clerical, secretarial, security, or data processing work; persons employed by a club, camp, recreational operation, museum, or retail outlet; marina employees not engaged in the construction, replacement, or expansion of the marina; suppliers, transporters, and vendors doing business temporarily at the site of a covered employer; aquaculture workers; and employees who build any recreational vessel under 65 feet in length, or repair any recreational vessel, or dismantle any part of a recreational vessel in connection with the repair of the vessel.
Because persons who work on recreational vessels are not covered by the LHWCA, the legislation would allow employers to purchase workers' compensation for these workers under state laws rather than the LHWCA, which, due to the more generous benefits frequently offered by the LHWCA and the limited number of providers, may be more expensive."
335,"On May 7, 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Department of Justice (DOJ) implemented a ""zero tolerance"" policy toward illegal border crossing, both to discourage illegal migration into the United States and to reduce the burden of processing asylum claims that Administration officials contend are often fraudulent.
Under the zero tolerance policy, DOJ prosecuted 100% of adult aliens apprehended crossing the border illegally, making no exceptions for whether they were asylum seekers or accompanied by minor children.
This report briefly reviews the statutory authority for prosecuting persons who enter the United States illegally between U.S. ports of entry, and the policies and procedures for processing apprehended illegal border entrants and any accompanying children.
On June 20, 2018, following considerable and largely negative public attention to family separations stemming from the zero tolerance policy, President Trump issued an executive order (EO) mandating that DHS maintain custody of alien families ""during the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their member,"" to the extent permitted by law and appropriations.
On June 25, 2018, CBP announced that, because of ICE's lack of family detention bed space, it had temporarily halted the policy of referring adults who cross the border illegally with children to DOJ for criminal prosecution."
336,"Introduction Telecommunication providers and technology companies around the world have been working together to research and develop new technology solutions to meet growing demands for mobile data from consumers and industrial users.
Telecommunication companies continually invest in their networks to provide faster, more reliable service, expand the capacity of networks to meet growing demands for data, and support new technology uses.
The Emergence of 5G Technologies Since 2012, telecommunications standards development organizations (SDO), with the help of their industry partners, have been researching ways to improve mobile communication networks; link people, devices, and data through a smart network; and enable a ""seamlessly connected society."" Companies are developing new technologies that are expected to improve networks, meet the growing demand for data, support IoT applications, and enable a seamlessly connected society.
China plans to deploy domestically; capture the revenues from its massive domestic market (e.g., consumers and industrial users); upgrade industrial systems to increase the efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness of Chinese technology companies; build its capacity to develop technology equipment and components; and become a leading supplier of 5G technologies to the world (e.g., network equipment and IoT devices).
Current 5G Deployment Status The Chinese government has advanced on its plan: investing in R&D, participating and leading in 5G standards development to benefit Chinese firms, engaging in international 5G projects to build knowledge, building capacity to provide 5G equipment, and reserving spectrum for 5G use.
Experts assert that China has an advantage over the United States in freeing spectrum for 5G, in that it can ""exert much stronger control over existing spectrum users."" Industry experts have noted that China has eliminated ""regulatory red tape to expedite deployment and make it easier for industry to access large blocks of higher frequency spectrum bands."" In December 2018, China reportedly allocated large swathes of mid-band spectrum to its three state-owned mobile operators, ""preparing the way for large-scale networks testing in 2019, and the launch of commercial 5G services by 2020."" Equipment and Devices Just as telecommunications providers are racing to deploy 5G, technology companies and device makers are racing to be the first to deploy 5G equipment and phones, to achieve the economic benefits expected from 5G technologies.
Those who share this view believe China's ambition is 5G dominance using several methods, including continued investment in networks, products, and standards that support critical infrastructure and services that will rely on 5G technology; shaping industry standards, regulations, and policies; and ""extracting concessions from large multinationals in exchange for market access."" FBI Director Christopher Wray has also highlighted the potential threat associated with any increase in the integration of Chinese-made or designed devices and 5G cellular network equipment into the United States telecommunications network, stating that We're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks."

338,"First, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways.
Eight years later, amid concerns that the existing sources of funds for airport development would be insufficient to meet national airport needs, the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 (Title IX of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, P.L. 101-508 ) allowed the Secretary of Transportation to authorize public agencies that control commercial airports to impose a passenger facility charge on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at their airports.
Different airports use different combinations of AIP funding, PFCs, tax-exempt bonds, state and local grants, and airport revenues to finance particular projects.
It also authorized supplemental annual funding from the general fund to the AIP discretionary grants program ($1.02 billion in FY2019, $1.04 billion in FY2020, $1.06 billion in FY2021, $1.09 billion in FY2022, and $1.11 billion in FY2023), and required at least 50% of these additional funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports.
The act provided a $500 million supplemental appropriation from the general fund to the AIP discretionary grants program and required that this money remain available through September 30, 2021.
Large and medium hub airports that collect a passenger facility charge of $3 or less have their AIP formula entitlements reduced by an amount equal to 50% of their projected PFC revenue for the fiscal year until they forgo or give back 50% of their AIP formula grants.
§47134, the pilot program for private ownership of airports; airports reclassified as medium hubs due to increased passenger volumes may retain eligibility for up to a 90% federal share for a two-year transition period; certain economically distressed communities receiving subsidized air service may be eligible for up to a 95% federal share of project costs."

340,"The requirements to register a group as a CMO, as well as guidelines governing how official resources under the control of the Member may be available to use for CMO activities, are provided on the website of the Committee on House Administration.
A group seeking identification as a CMO must also register electronically with the Committee on House Administration by submitting a letter on official letterhead containing the name of the CMO, its statement of purpose, names of its officers, and contact information for staff designated to work on issues related to the CMO.
An informal Member organization can be readily established as circumstances and issues warrant without first enacting legislation or changing House, Senate, or party rules; open or limit its membership as it deems necessary to accomplish its goals; expand Members' opportunities to specialize on issues because there is no limit on the number of groups that can exist or on the number of groups that a Member can join; serve as a vehicle for the resolution of issue and policy differences between committees, parties, or the two houses; provide an opportunity for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to issues over which committee jurisdiction is unclear or fragmented; conduct briefings and use other means to provide Members information and analysis on issues of interest; attract attention to issues that the group members believe need to be addressed; and enhance Members' relations and standing with particular constituencies.
Given continuing concerns that, without congressional oversight, informal Member groups might be used to circumvent House ethics rules, on July 18, 1979, the Committee on House Administration issued the first regulations governing their activities.

342,"Nearly 25 years after warring parties in Bosnia reached the Dayton Agreement (see below), Bosnia faces numerous internal and external challenges, and the country retains geopolitical importance to U.S. interests in the Western Balkans.
As Congress assesses ongoing and emerging security issues in the region, including resilience against malign external influence, renewed conflict, and radicalization, Bosnia's internal politics and its role in Balkan stability may merit further examination.
Nationalist leaders in Serbia and Croatia appealed to Bosnian Serbs and Croats as ethnic ""kin."" The party that ruled Croatia for most of the 1990s, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), established a sister party with the same name to mobilize Bosnian Croats and compete in Bosnia's elections.
Its provisions partly reflect the situation on the ground in 1995, including the subdivision of Bosnia into two ethnoterritorial entities ( Figure 1 ): Republika Srpska (""RS""), which Bosnian Serb leaders had proclaimed in 1992, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (""FBiH,"" predominantly populated by Bosniaks and Croats), which was created by the 1994 Washington Agreement.
Until the mid-2000s, the High Representative used these powers to remove officials deemed to be obstructive to peace and to promote what are considered among the most constructive reforms since Dayton, including merging the entities' armed forces and intelligence services and putting them under new state-level ministries.
Foreign Relations and Security Issues  European Union and NATO Membership  U.S. and EU policymakers view the NATO and EU accession processes as a positive force for democratization and reform in the Western Balkans, including Bosnia.
The Croatian government financially and politically backed Čović in Bosnia's 2018 elections, and Croatian politicians have raised the issue of Bosnian Croats' constitutional challenges (see above, ""Legal Challenges"") in forums like the European Parliament, NATO, and the United Nations."
343,"While the FAST Act concerns many aspects of surface transportation funding and safety policy, the focus of this report is on truck freight and that portion of the rail and port industries that transports truck trailers and containers (intermodal freight).
Certain port projects are eligible for funding from surface transportation programs, including the BUILD and INFRA competitive grant programs discussed later in this report, but eligibility reflects a primary concern with the intermodal connections to these facilities.
Up to 10% of a state's apportionment can be directed toward projects within rail or port terminals ""that provide surface transportation infrastructure necessary to facilitate direct intermodal interchange, transfer, and access into or out of the facility.""  Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects Program (FASTLANE/INFRA) The Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects Program is a discretionary grant program with funding of $800 million in FY2016 rising to $1 billion in FY2020.

344,"Introduction Charging fees for grazing private livestock on federal lands is statutorily authorized and has been the policy of the Forest Service (FS, Department of Agriculture) since 1906, and of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM, Department of the Interior) since 1936.
Today, fees are charged for grazing on BLM and FS land basically under a fee formula established in the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (PRIA) and continued administratively.
The Secretaries' report included (1) a discussion of livestock production in the western United States; (2) an estimate of each agency's cost for implementing its grazing programs; (3) estimates of the market value for public rangeland grazing; (4) potential modifications to the PRIA formula; (5) alternative fee systems; and (6) economic effects of the fee system options on permittees."
345,"Basic Center Program: Provides funding to community-based organizations for crisis intervention, temporary shelter, counseling, family unification, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families.

Street Outreach Program: Provides funding to community-based organizations for street-based outreach and education, including treatment, counseling, provision of information, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, prostitution, and trafficking.
Under an HHS grant, Youth with Child Welfare Involvement at Risk of Homelessness , the 18 grantees (state, local, and tribal child welfare agencies or community-based organizations) evaluated multiple risk factors for homelessness among child welfare-involved populations: which include those who have had numerous foster care placements, run away from foster care, been placed in a group home, had a history of mental health or behavioral health diagnoses, had juvenile justice involvement, had a history of substance abuse, been emancipated from foster care, and been parenting or fathered a child.
The remaining share of consolidated funding is allocated for (1) a national communication system to facilitate communication between service providers, runaway youth, and their families (National Safeline); (2) training and technical support for grantees; (3) evaluations of the programs; (4) federal coordination efforts on matters relating to the health, education, employment, and housing of these youth; and (5) studies of runaway and homeless youth.
The project funded nine grantees over a two-year period that tested approaches for serving populations that need additional support: LGBTQ runaway and homeless youth ages 16 to 21; and young adults who have left foster care because of emancipation."
346,"By 1934, Roosevelt had used these extensive new powers to regulate ""Every transaction in foreign exchange, transfer of credit between any banking institution within the United States and any banking institution outside of the United States.""  With America's entry into the Second World War in 1941, Congress again amended TWEA to grant the President extensive powers over the disposition of private property, adding the so-called ""vesting"" power, which authorized the permanent seizure of property.
In 1977, during the House markup of a bill revising TWEA, Representative Jonathan Bingham, Chairperson of the House International Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Economic Policy, described TWEA as conferring ""on the President what could have been dictatorial powers that he could have used without any restraint by Congress."" According to the Department of Justice, TWEA granted the President four major groups of powers in a time of war or other national emergency: (a) Regulatory powers with respect to foreign exchange, banking transfers, coin, bullion, currency, and securities; (b) Regulatory powers with respect to ""any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest""; (c) The power to vest ""any property or interest of any foreign country or national thereof""; and (d) The powers to hold, use, administer, liquidate, sell, or otherwise deal with ""such interest or property"" in the interest of and for the benefit of the United States.
The House report on the reform legislation called TWEA ""essentially an unlimited grant of authority for the President to exercise, at his discretion, broad powers in both the domestic and international economic arena, without congressional review."" The criticisms of TWEA centered on the following: (a) It required no consultation or reports to Congress with regard to the use of powers or the declaration of a national emergency.
Finally, Congress wrote the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to confer ""upon the President a new set of authorities for use in time of national emergency which are both more limited in scope than those of section 5(b) and subject to procedural limitations, including those of the [NEA]."" The Report of the House Committee on International Relations summed up the nature of an ""emergency"" in their ""new approach"" to international emergency economic powers: [G]iven the breadth of the authorities, and their availability at the President's discretion upon a declaration of a national emergency, their exercise should be subject to various substantive restrictions.
IEEPA's Statute, its Use, and Judicial Interpretation IEEPA's Statute IEEPA, as currently amended, empowers the president to: (A) investigate, regulate, or prohibit:  (i) any transactions in foreign exchange,  (ii) transfers of credit or payments between, by, through, or to any banking institution, to the extent that such transfers or payments involve any interest of any foreign country or national thereof,  (iii) the importing or exporting of currencies or securities; and (B) investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
Section 159 of this bill amends section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to provide the President with authority similar to what he currently has under the Trading With the Enemy Act in circumstances where there has been an armed attack on the United States, or where Congress has enacted a law authorizing the President to use armed force against a foreign country, foreign organization, or foreign national.
For example, in the first use of IEEPA, President Jimmy Carter issued an executive order that both declared a national emergency with respect to the ""situation in Iran"" and ""blocked all property and interests in property of the Government of Iran [...]."" Five months later, President Carter issued a second order dramatically expanding the scope of the first EO and effectively blocked the transfer of all goods, money, or credit destined for Iran by anyone subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
After the first war with Iraq, President George H.W. Bush ordered the transfer of frozen Iraqi assets derived from the sale of Iraqi petroleum held by U.S. banks to be transferred to a holding account in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to fulfill ""the rights and obligations of the United States under U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 778."" The President cited a section of the United Nations Participation Act (UNPA), as well as IEEPA, as authority to take the action.
To facilitate the payment of judgments under the exception, Congress passed Section 117 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, which further amended the FSIA by allowing attachment and execution against state property with respect to which financial transactions are prohibited or regulated under Section 5(b) TWEA, Section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act (authorizing the trade embargo against Cuba), or Sections 202 and 203 of IEEPA, or any orders, licenses or other authority issued under these statutes."
347,"P.L. 115-324 , the Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018, which directs federal agencies proposing a size standard (and, based on report language accompanying the act, presumably the SBA as well) to use the average annual gross receipts from at least the previous five years, instead of the previous three years, when seeking SBA approval to establish a size standard based on annual gross receipts.
The Select Committee began its review by asserting that the need to define the concept of small business was based on a general consensus that assisting small business was necessary to enhance economic competition, combat monopoly formation, inhibit the concentration of economic power, and maintain ""the integrity of independent enterprise."" It noted that the definition of small businesses in federal statutes reflected this consensus by taking into consideration the firm's size relative to other firms in its field and ""matters of independence and nondominance."" For example, the War Mobilization and Reconversion Act of 1944 defined a small business as either ""employing 250 wage earners or less"" or having ""sales volumes, quantities of materials consumed, capital investments, or any other criteria which are reasonably attributable to small plants rather than medium- or large-sized plants."" The Selective Service Act of 1948 classified a business as small for military procurement purposes if ""(1) its position in the trade or industry of which it is a part is not dominant, (2) the number of its employees does not exceed 500, and (3) it is independently owned and operated."" The Select Committee also found that, for data-gathering purposes, the executive branch defined small businesses in relative, as opposed to absolute, terms within specific industries.
GAO's report, issued in 1978, found that the SBA's size standards ""are often high and often are not justified by economic rationale."" Specifically, GAO reported that many size standards may not direct assistance to the target group described in SBA regulations as businesses ""struggling to become or remain competitive"" because the loan and procurement size standards for most industries were established 15 or more years ago and have not been periodically reviewed; SBA records do not indicate how most standards were developed; and the standards often define as small a very high percentage of the firms in the industries to which they apply.
In addition, several federal agencies indicated that the proposed size standards in the services and construction industries were set too low, reducing the number of small firms eligible to compete for procurement contracts below levels they deemed necessary to ensure adequate competition to prevent agency costs from rising.
The SBA argued that it was concerned that ""not all of its size standards may now adequately define small businesses in the U.S. economy, which has seen industry consolidations, technological advances, emerging new industries, shifting societal preferences, and other significant industrial changes."" It added that its reliance on an ad hoc approach ""scrutinizing the limited number of specific industries during a year, while worthwhile, leaves unexamined many deserving industries for updating and may create over time a set of illogical size standards."" The SBA announced that it would begin its analysis of its size standards by assuming that ""$6.5 million [later increased to $7.5 million] is an appropriate size standard for those industries with receipts size standards and 500 employees for those industries with employee size standards."" It would then analyze the following industry characteristics: ""average firm size; average asset size (a proxy for startup costs); competition, as measured by the market share of the four largest firms in the industry; and, the distribution of market share by firm size—that is, are firms in the industry generally very small firms, or dominated by very large firms."" Then, before making its final determination on the size standard, it would ""examine the participation of small businesses in federal contracting and SBA's guaranteed loan program at the current size standard level.
Depending on the level of small business participation, additional consideration may be given to the level of the current size standard and the analysis of industry factors."" In April 2009, the SBA announced that was simplifying the administration and use of its size standards by reducing the number of receipts based size standards from 31 to 8 when establishing a new size standard or reviewing an existing size standard: For many years, SBA has been concerned about the complexity of determining small business status caused by a large number of varying receipts based size standards (see 69 FR 13130 (March 4, 2004) and 57 FR 62515 (December 31, 1992))."

349,"Since enactment of the FIRE Act in the 106 th Congress, the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program (also known as ""fire grants"" and ""FIRE Act grants"") has provided funding for equipment and training directly from the federal government to local fire departments.
The same SAFER waiver authority was included in the Administration's FY2015 budget proposal and in the FY2015 House and Senate Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bills."
350,"When Congress changed the LIHEAP formula in 1984, there were two primary differences from the previous formula: home heating needs were not emphasized to the same degree, and the law provided that HHS use the most recent data available to calculate allotments (the LIEAP formula used static data to distribute funds to the states).
Congress directed that LIEAP state allocations be determined using a complex combination of alternate formulas and factors that included residential energy expenditures, a measure of ""coldness"" called heating degree days, and household income.
Calculating the New Formula Percentages The LIHEAP formula uses the home energy expenditures of low-income households in each state as a first step in determining the amount of total regular funds that each state will receive.
The LIHEAP formula in FY1984 distributed funds by giving states the same percentage of funds that they received in FY1981 under the predecessor program, the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP).
""New"" Formula with Hold-Harmless Level: Appropriations Between $1.975 Billion and $2.25 Billion If the regular LIHEAP appropriation exceeds the equivalent of a hypothetical FY1984 appropriation of $1.975 billion for the fiscal year, all funds are to be distributed under a different methodology, using the new set of percentages described earlier.
""New"" Formula with Hold-Harmless Level and Rate: Appropriations At or Above $2.25 Billion The LIHEAP statute stipulates additional requirements in the method for distributing funds when the appropriation is at or above $2.25 billion."
351,"The HUBZone program provides participating small businesses located in areas with low income, high poverty, or high levels of unemployment with contracting opportunities in the form of set-asides , sole-source awards , and price-evaluation preferences .
The act also allows governors, starting on January 1, 2020, to petition the SBA each year to designate areas located in nonurban areas, with a population of 50,000 or fewer, and an average unemployment rate at least 120% of the national or state average, whichever is lower, as HUBZones; requires the SBA to process HUBZone certification applications with sufficient and complete documentation within 60 days of receipt; ensures that HUBZone-eligible BRAC areas receive HUBZone eligibility for a full eight years, beginning on the date they are designated a BRAC; and requires the SBA, not later than one year after enactment, to publish performance metrics measuring the HUBZone program's success in promoting economic development in economically distressed areas.
During the 114 th Congress, P.L. 114-187 , the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), includes a provision requiring the SBA to implement, within 270 days following PROMESA's enactment (which took place on June 30, 2016), a risk-based approach to requesting and verifying information from firms applying to be designated or recertified as a qualified HUBZone small business.
In addition, as passed by the House on May 18, 2012, H.R. 4310 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, included a provision that would have increased the 23% contracting goal for small businesses generally to 25%.
Debates over the program's effect on economically distressed communities, as reflected in GAO's recommendation for new SBA performance measures; the federal government's difficulty in meeting the 3% contracting goal; the reduction in the number of HUBZone firms; and small business anxiety concerning the increased frequency of HUBZone eligibility determinations have all served to elevate congressional interest in the program."
352,"Identical to the Administration's budget request, the House bill would provide $43.493 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.5 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center."
353,"This report introduces the DRF and outlines how its resources are made available through a series of simple questions, presents a brief history of the federal government's involvement in domestic disaster relief, describes how the request for general disaster relief funding has been formulated over time, and examines the congressional response to those requests.
The DRF is the primary source of funding for the federal government's general disaster relief program—response and recovery efforts pursuant to a range of domestic emergencies and disasters in existing law—as opposed to specific relief and recovery initiatives that may be enacted for individual incidents.
Although this legislation comes with broad latitude for the President in expending these funds, this appropriation contained several hallmarks that continue in today's disaster relief structure: the President makes the determination that a disaster has occurred, and that federal aid is required; the state has a role in certifying the need and committing state resources to be eligible for federal support; aid is to ""supplement the efforts and available resources of State and local governments or other agencies,"" rather than to fund the entire relief effort; and the President may direct federal agencies to participate in emergency assistance.
As the severity, frequency, and resultant costs to the federal government of the array of disasters that will strike the United States in a given year have always been unpredictable in an annual budgetary context, disaster relief funding frequently has been provided through deficiency, and later supplemental, appropriations.
Disaster Relief Designation As will be discussed later in this report, the adoption of a special designation for the costs of major disasters under the Stafford Act as a part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ) made it easier to provide budget authority to the DRF in the annual appropriations process.
Since the FY2013 budget request, FEMA has bifurcated its annual appropriations request between the costs of major disasters—the ""Disaster Relief Category""—and everything else funded by the DRF—""Base Disaster Relief,"" which includes funding for emergency designations, fire management assistance, pre-disaster declaration surge activities, and Disaster Readiness and Support Programs."
354,"On July 24, 2018, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would be taking several temporary actions to assist farmers in response to trade damage from what the Administration has characterized as ""unjustified retaliation."" Specifically, USDA would authorize up to $12 billion in financial assistance—referred to as the ""trade aid"" package—for certain agricultural commodities under Section 5 of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714c).
The trade-aid package includes a Market Facilitation Program (MFP) of direct payments to affected producers, a Food Purchase and Distribution Program, and an Agricultural Trade Promotion (ATP) program.
Joe Glauber, a former USDA chief economist, stated, ""I would be very hesitant to say categorically, 'No, we're not going to hit our $19.1 [billion ceiling].'""  Industry Response to MFP Payment Allocation While soybean growers and most farm-advocacy groups have generally been supportive of the payments, some commodity groups—most notably associations representing corn, wheat, and milk—contend that the MFP payments are insufficient to fully compensate their industries (see Table A-4 and Appendix B for a comparison of ""trade loss"" and ""market loss"")."
355,"Authorized by P.L. 85-699, the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, the SBIC program is designed to ""improve and stimulate the national economy in general and the small-business segment thereof in particular"" by stimulating and supplementing ""the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization, and which are not available in adequate supply."" The SBIC program was created to address concerns raised in a Federal Reserve Board report to Congress that identified a gap in the capital markets for long-term funding for growth-oriented small businesses.
It partners with privately owned and managed SBICs licensed by the SBA to provide financing to small businesses with private capital the SBIC has raised (called regulatory capital) and with funds (called leverage) the SBIC borrows at favorable rates because the SBA guarantees the debenture (loan obligation).
The SBA stopped issuing new commitments for participating securities primarily because the program experienced a projected loss of $2.7 billion during the early 2000s as investments in technology startup and early stage small businesses lost much of their stock value at that time.
In recognition of the higher risk associated with investments in early stage small businesses, the initiative included ""several new regulatory provisions intended to reduce the risk that an early stage SBIC would default on its leverage and to improve SBA's recovery prospects should a default occur."" For example, early stage SBICs are required to raise more regulatory capital (at least $20 million) than debenture SBICs, impact investment SBICs (at least $5 million), and participating securities SBICs (at least $10 million).
As of September 30, 2018, the five early stage SBICs had raised $251.3 million in private capital, received $138.4 million in SBA-guaranteed leverage, had $43.7 million in outstanding commitments, and invested $267.5 million in 82 small businesses.
Because the SBA is no longer providing new licenses or leverage for participating securities SBICs, several Members have introduced legislation to create a new SBA program that would focus on the investment needs of startup and early stage small businesses."
356,"(Similarly, once the Appropriations Committees report their sub-allocations to their respective chambers, the Budget Act bars the consideration of any spending measures that would cause those sub-allocations to be violated.) Enforcement Through the Budget Reconciliation Process While points of order can be effective in enforcing the budgetary goals outlined in the budget resolution, they can be raised against legislation only when it is pending on the House or Senate floor.
As described below, the mechanisms vary in form and function, but they always (1) include or reference certain budgetary levels (e.g., aggregate spending limits and committee spending allocations) and (2) contain language stipulating that such levels are to be enforceable by points of order as if they had been included in a budget resolution."
357,"The Trump Administration encapsulated its assessment of the threat posed by Iran in a late September 2018 State Department report entitled ""Outlaw Regime: A Chronicle of Iran's Destructive Activities."" It outlines Iran's malign activities as well as a litany of other activities the Administration terms ""the Iranian regime's destructive behavior at home and abroad."" The U.S. intelligence community testified in January 2019 that ""Iran's regional ambitions and improved military capabilities almost certainly will threaten U.S. interests in the coming year, driven by Tehran's perception of increasing U.S., Saudi, and Israeli hostility, as well as continuing border insecurity, and the influence of hardliners."" An annual Defense Department report on Iran's military power required by successive National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs), generally contain assessments similar to those presented publicly by the intelligence community.
Iranian leaders frequently assert that the Islamic revolution made Iran independent of U.S. influence and that the country's foreign policy is intended, at least in part, to ensure that the United States cannot interfere in Iran's domestic affairs.
More moderate Iranian leaders, including President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, argue that Iran should not have any ""permanent enemies."" They maintain that a pragmatic foreign policy has resulted in easing of international sanctions under the JCPOA, increased worldwide attention to Iran's views, and the positioning of Iran as a trade and transportation hub.
The State Department report on international terrorism for 2017 stated that Iran remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in 2017, and continued to provide arms, training, and military advisers in support of allied governments and movements, such as the regime of President Bashar Al Asad of Syria, Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, Houthi rebels in Yemen, Shia militias in Iraq, and underground violent groups in Bahrain.
On October 13, 2017, and January 12, 2018, the President threatened to withdraw the United States from the JCPOA unless Congress and the European countries acted to (1) extend the JCPOA's nuclear restrictions beyond current deadlines to ensure that Iran never comes close to developing a nuclear weapon; (2) impose strict sanctions on Iran's development of ballistic missiles; and (3) ensure that Iran allows ""immediate"" access to any site that the IAEA wants to visit.
Missiles37 According to the September 2018 Administration report ""Outlaw Regime: A Chronicle of Iran's Destructive Activities,"" Iran has ""the largest ballistic missile force in the Middle East, with more than ten ballistic missile systems either in its inventory or in development, and a stockpile of hundreds of missiles that threaten its neighbors in the region."" The intelligence community has said publicly that Iran ""can strike targets up to 2,000 kilometers from Iran's borders.""  Iran is not known to possess an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capability (missiles of ranges over 2,900 miles), but the DNI threat assessment testimony of February 13, 2018, stated that ""Iran's work on a space launch vehicle (SLV)—including on its Simorgh—shortens the timeline to an ICBM because SLVs and ICBMs use similar technologies."" However, then-IRGC Commander-in-Chief Ali Jafari said in October 2017 that the existing ranges of Iran's missiles are ""sufficient for now,"" suggesting that Iran has no plans to develop an ICBM.
The U.S. intelligence community has said in recent years that Iran ""continues to develop and improve a range of new military capabilities to target U.S. and allied military assets in the region, including armed UAVs, ballistic missiles, advanced naval mines, unmanned explosive boats, submarines and advanced torpedoes, and anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles.""  Resolution 2231 (the operative Security Council resolution on Iran) ""calls on"" Iran not to develop or test ballistic missiles ""designed to be capable of"" delivering a nuclear weapon, for up to eight years from Adoption Day of the JCPOA (October 18, 2015).
Several successive Administrations have designated Iranian missile-related entities for sanctions under Executive Order 13382 and the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act. The Trump Administration has demanded, as a condition of any revised JCPOA, a binding ban on Iran's development of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles.
According to the August 2018 report to Congress mandated by the Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act, Iran has bought weaponry from Russia, China, North Korea, Belarus, and Ukraine, and ""has obtained missile and aircraft technology from foreign suppliers, including China and North Korea."" Iran and Russia have cooperated closely to assist the Asad regime in Syria.
The State Department's 2018 report ""Outlaw Regime: A Chronicle of Iran's Destructive Activities"" asserts that Iran has spent over $16 billion since 2012 ""propping up the Assad regime and supporting [Iran's] other partners and proxies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen."" The Administration has also articulated 12 specific demands for Iran to change its behavior in exchange for a new JCPOA and normalized relations with the United States and the international community.
The demands pertaining to Iran's regional activities, as stipulated in the May 21, 2018, speech by Secretary of State Pompeo at the Heritage Foundation are that Iran: End support to Middle East terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
According to the Secretary, ""We have told the Islamic Republic of Iran that using a proxy force to attack an American interest will not prevent us from responding against the prime actor."" In early May 2019, the United States sent accelerated the deployment of an aircraft carrier group and sent a bomber group to the Persian Gulf region in response to what the Administration said were ""troubling; and escalatory indications and warnings"" related to Iran.
Successive Administrations have described many of Iran's regional operations as ""malign activities."" Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, in the February 13, 2018, delivery of the annual worldwide threat assessment testimony before Congress, assessed that ""Iran will seek to expand its influence in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, where it sees conflicts generally trending in Tehran's favor."" Secretary of State Pompeo described a litany of Iranian malign activities in his speech to the Heritage Foundation on May 21, 2018, referenced above.
In 1981, perceiving a threat from revolutionary Iran and spillover from the Iran-Iraq War that began in September 1980, the six Gulf states formed the Gulf Cooperation Council alliance (GCC: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates).
In July 2018, the State Department named the Al Ashtar Brigades as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), based on State Department assertions that Iran has provided weapons, funding, and training to Bahraini militant Shia groups that have conducted attacks on the Bahraini security forces.
The summit meetings produced announcements of a U.S.-GCC strategic partnership and specific commitments to (1) facilitate U.S. arms transfers to the GCC states; (2) increase U.S.-GCC cooperation on maritime security, cybersecurity, and counterterrorism; (3) organize additional large-scale joint military exercises and U.S. training; and (4) implement a Gulf-wide coordinated ballistic missile defense capability, which the United States has sought to promote in recent years.
U.S. officials have stated that the intra-GCC rift centered on Qatar is harming the U.S.-led effort to forge a united strategy against Iran, and, since April 2018, President Trump reportedly has been insisting that Gulf leaders resolve the rift, although without evident success to date.
October 2017, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on Iran-backed militias to disarm and for their Iranian advisors to ""go home."" The Trump Administration reportedly has worked with the Iraqi government, with mixed success to date, to integrate the militias into the official security forces or demobilize and merge into the political process.
Some experts and U.S. officials have asserted that Iran has sought to position IRGC-QF operatives and Hezbollah members in Latin America to potentially carry out terrorist attacks against Israeli targets in the region or even in the United States itself."
358,"A July 2012 Navy report to Congress on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships (see next section) states the following: Once a type/class naming convention [i.e., a general rule or guideline for how ships of a certain type or class are to be named] is established, Secretaries can rely on many sources to help in the final selection of a ship name.
§8662(a) states, ""Not more than one vessel of the Navy may have the same name."" One possible step for resolving such an issue would be to change the name of SSBN-826 to something else, such as District of Columbia —a step that could be viewed as somewhat similar to the below-discussed instance in which the name of the Los Angles-class submarine SSN-705 was changed from Corpus Christi to City of Corpus Christi (see "" Congressional Responses to Announced Navy Ship-Naming Decisions "" below).
Another exception occurred on January 9, 2014, when then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that SSN-795, the second of the two Virginia-class boats procured in FY2015, would be named for Admiral Hyman G.
Oilers (TAOs) On January 6, 2016, then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that the Navy's new oilers will be named for ""people who fought for civil rights and human rights,"" and that the first ship in the class, TAO-205, which was procured in FY2016, will be named for Representative John Lewis.
(See the Virginia-class attack submarine naming announcements of April 13, 2012; November 19, 2012; September 18, 2014; October 10, 2014; and September 2, 2015, respectively.) As shown in Table 1 , the three states for which the most time now appears to have passed since a ship named for the state has been in commissioned service with the Navy as a combat asset, and for which no ship by that name is currently under construction, are Kansas, Arizona, and Oklahoma.
As noted earlier, the July 2012 Navy report to Congress states the following: At the appropriate time—normally sometime after the ship has been either authorized or appropriated by Congress and before its keel laying or christening—the Secretary records his decision with a formal naming announcement."
359,"Such funding is provided for a specified period of time, which may be extended through the enactment of subsequent CRs. A continuing appropriations act is commonly referred to as a continuing resolution or CR because it has typically been in the form of a joint resolution rather than a bill.
Main Components of Continuing Resolutions Congress has included six main components in CRs. First, CRs provide funding for certain activities ( coverage ), which are typically specified with reference to the prior or current fiscal year's appropriations acts.
In FY1977, although all 13 regular appropriations bills became law on or before the start of the fiscal year, two CRs were enacted to provide funding for certain activities that had not been included in the regular appropriations acts."
360,"Expansionary Fiscal Policy During a recession, aggregate demand (overall spending) in the economy falls, which generally results in slower wage growth, decreased employment, lower business revenue, and lower business investment.
Potential Offsetting Effects to Expansionary Fiscal Policy Investment and Interest Rates To engage in fiscal stimulus by either increasing spending or decreasing tax revenue, the government must increase the size of its deficit and borrow money to finance that stimulus."
361,"On April 7, 2016, the Office of the State Counsellor announced that ""releasing prisoners of conscience who are behind bars for their involvement in peaceful political activities is one of the priorities of the new government."" The following day, Aung San Suu Kyi ordered that charges be dropped for 114 people facing charges for their participation in a peaceful protest against a proposed National Education Bill.
The released political prisoners also included 6 individuals imprisoned under the Unlawful Associations Act for their alleged association with one of Burma's ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), 5 people sentenced for violations of the Telecommunications Law, and 4 persons convicted of violating Penal Code 505(b).
The next day, Acting President Myint Swe granted Lieutenant Colonel Yu Naing the authority to press charges under the Official Secrets Act and Burma's Information Ministry announced their arrest and detention for ""possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces (with the intent) to send them to a foreign news agency."" The trial of Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone lasted over eight months and was full of conflicting and unusual testimony."
362,"Specifically, FDA and USDA officials said they have limited information on  cell-cultured meat production methods and products and need more in  order to regulate this new food.
As  the agencies continue to collaborate on their shared oversight of cell- cultured meat, by more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for  collaboration into their interagency agreement, they will be better  positioned to address potential fragmentation in their efforts to ensure the  safety of the food supply as cell-cultured meat products near  commercialization and entry into the marketplace.
By more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for interagency  collaboration early in the development of the three working groups, FDA  and USDA could proactively minimize potential fragmentation and overlap  in their oversight of cell-cultured meat, ensure consistency and efficient  use of resources, and provide clarity to key stakeholders.
Moreover, by more fully incorporating all seven leading practices  for interagency collaboration early in the development of the working  groups, FDA and USDA could proactively minimize potential  fragmentation and overlap in their oversight of cell-cultured meat and  ensure they are utilizing resources efficiently or effectively.
By taking steps to  document in their interagency agreement, or other publicly available  document, which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than  catfish, FDA and USDA could better ensure that members of the public  and other key stakeholders such as cell-cultured meat firms have clarity  about the agencies’ oversight responsibilities in this area.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making a total of six recommendations, three to FDA and three to  USDA:  The Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, in coordination  with the Secretary of Agriculture, should more fully incorporate the seven  leading practices for effective collaboration in the agencies’ interagency  agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat.
FDA and USDA partially concurred with our recommendation, directed to  each agency, to more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for  effective collaboration into the agencies’ interagency agreement for the  joint oversight of cell-cultured meat.
We continue to  believe that FDA and USDA should more fully incorporate the seven  leading practices for effective collaboration into their interagency  agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat."
363,"In addition, federal  ethics regulations establish when and how federal officials should review  financial disclosure forms to identify and prevent conflicts of interest  prohibited by federal law for any prospective committee members  required to file these forms in connection with their appointments to  advisory committees.
Therefore, the draft membership grid, which documents EPA staff’s  rationale for recommending specific candidates, is intended to serve  as the basis for discussions with EPA management as final decisions  about the committee’s composition are made, according to EPA’s  Federal Advisory Committee Handbook.
Specifically, the fiscal year 2018 appointment packets for the  SAB and CASAC did not include draft membership grid documents  reflecting EPA staff rationales for recommending the candidates EPA’s  staff deem best qualified and most appropriate for achieving balanced  committee membership.
However, under EPA’s established process, agency staff are to document  in draft membership grids and include in appointment packets their  rationales for recommending the candidates they deem best qualified and  most appropriate for achieving balanced committees.
Because EPA had not periodically evaluated through audits or spot- checks the quality of financial disclosure reviews for SGEs appointed to  advisory committees, the agency was not well positioned to compare the  program’s actual performance with planned results or address instances  of noncompliance with federal ethics requirements.
There may be benefits to following different procedures; however, under  EPA’s established process, agency staff are to document in draft  membership grids and include in appointment packets their rationales for  recommending the candidates they deem best qualified and most  appropriate for achieving balanced committees."
364,"For  example,  Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, Hawaii, did not consider extreme  weather and climate change effects in its most recent master plan,  although it is located in an area that has been subject to tropical  storms and where, according to projections in the DOD database of  sea level change scenarios, further sea level rise is anticipated.
Despite a DOD directive requiring that the military departments assess  and manage risks to both built and natural infrastructure, DOD has not  required in the Unified Facilities Criteria standard that guides master  planning that installations assess risks posed by extreme weather and  climate change effects as part of their master plans or develop plans to  address identified risks.
McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019, DOD updated the Unified Facilities Criteria on master planning to  specify that climate projections from reliable and authorized sources,  such the U.S. Global Change Research Office and the National Climate  Assessment, shall be considered and incorporated into military  construction designs and modifications.
Simply updating the language of the Unified Facilities Criteria on master  planning in November 2018 to require the use of climate projections does  not provide guidance to installations on how to use climate projections,  such as what future time periods to consider and how to incorporate  projections involving multiple future scenarios, nor does it identify the  specific types of projections to use.
(Recommendation 1) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Chief of Civil Engineers  and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command works with the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment, the Chief of Engineers  and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the  Director of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to update the Unified  Facilities Criteria standard on installation master planning to require that  master plans include (1) an assessment of the risks from extreme  weather and climate change effects that are specific to the installation  and (2) plans to address those risks as appropriate.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of the Air Force should ensure that the Director of the Air  Force Civil Engineer Center works with the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment; the Chief of Engineers and Commanding  General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and the Chief of Civil  Engineers and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command to  update the Unified Facilities Criteria standard on installation master  planning to require that master plans include (1) an assessment of the  risks from extreme weather and climate change effects that are specific to  the installation and (2) plans to address those risks as appropriate.
(Recommendation 6) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Chief of Civil Engineers  and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command works with the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment, the Chief of Engineers  and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the  Director of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to update relevant Unified  Facilities Criteria to require that installations consider climate projections  in designing facilities projects and incorporate, as appropriate, DOD  guidance on the use of climate projections in facilities project designs— including identification of authoritative sources of such projections, use of  projections involving multiple future scenarios, and what future time  periods to consider."
365,"In addition to standard surveys, state survey  agencies are required by federal law to investigate (1) complaints  submitted by residents, family members, friends, physicians, and  nursing home staff; and (2) “facility-reported incidents,” including  incidents involving abuse of residents, that are self-reported by the  nursing homes.
In any instances  where surveyors substantiate the occurrence of resident abuse, the state  survey agency is required to refer the case to three entities: 1) local law  enforcement; 2) the MFCU, if appropriate; and 3) the state’s nurse aide  registry or other applicable professional licensure authority.
Further, if there is a reasonable suspicion that a crime has occurred  that results in serious bodily injury, federal law requires certain  covered individuals at the nursing home to immediately report to law  enforcement in addition to the state survey agency.
(We  discuss this issue in more detail later in this report.) CMS’s Ability to  Ensure Nursing  Home Residents Are  Free from Abuse May  Be Limited by Gaps in  Oversight We found that CMS: (1) cannot readily access data on the type of abuse  or type of perpetrator, (2) has not provided guidance on what information  nursing homes should include in facility-reported incidents, and (3) has  numerous gaps in its referral process that can result in delayed and  missed referrals to other entities.
Specifically, officials from each of the five state  survey agencies told us that the facility-reported incidents they receive  from nursing homes can lack key information that affects their ability to  effectively triage incidents and determine whether an investigation should  occur and how soon.
However, state survey agencies may decide not to  substantiate an abuse allegation verified by evidence if they believe no  deficiency should be cited, such as if the nursing home had taken  preventive action against the deficient practice, which could result in that  abuse going unreported and not referred to law enforcement, MFCUs, or  staff registries."
366,"Background This section provides an overview of (1) the legal framework governing  mixed HLW, (2) the status of EM’s IWTU reengineering project, (3) EM’s  requirements for capital asset projects and operations activities, (4)  DOE’s policy for the review of projects with start-up risks, and (5) our best  practices for assessing cost and schedule estimates.
Pursuant to such authorization, New Mexico’s Environment  Department issues the permit for hazardous waste storage and disposal  at WIPP under the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act. Status of IWTU  Reengineering Project As of March 2019, EM’s IWTU reengineering project was in phase two of  the four-phased approach to get the facility operational, according to EM  Idaho Cleanup Project officials.
Without fully  following best practices for a comprehensive cost estimate and well- constructed schedule estimate for SBW waste treatment operations, EM  cannot be assured that it has reliable cost and schedule estimates for  decision-making, placing it at risk of continued cost overruns and delays  in achieving its plans to reengineer the IWTU and begin treatment of the  SBW.
EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project stated that with the  suspension of developing hot isostatic pressing, they are studying the  potential packaging of the calcine waste for disposal without additional  treatment, or “direct disposal.” The analysis of alternatives report  identified direct disposal as having significant cost savings over other  technologies.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making five recommendations to DOE: The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of EM  to develop cost estimates for the IWTU reengineering project and the  SBW treatment operations that meet best practices for being  comprehensive (e.g., account for all costs).
(Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of EM  to develop schedule estimates for the IWTU reengineering project and  the SBW treatment operations that meet best practices for being well- constructed.
DOE agreed with our recommendations related to the management of the  IWTU reengineering project, including developing cost and schedule  estimates that meet best practices and ensuring the reliability of the EVM  system for the project."

368,"This set of data (which CMS  refers to as the Hospice Item Set) is used to calculate a hospice  provider’s performance on quality measures, which include seven  measures that reflect the percentage of all hospice patients’ stays where  the provider completed various key care processes, such as screening  patients for pain and shortness of breath.
(As noted  previously, CMS is working to account for other care indicators by  developing additional quality measures.) These indicators fall into two  categories: (1) the number of beneficiaries discharged prior to death  (often referred to as the live discharge rate) and (2) provider visits to  provide medical and emotional support to the beneficiary and caregivers  near the end of a beneficiary’s life.
We also  found that CMS’s lack of authority to establish additional enforcement  remedies before termination, which CMS rarely uses, limits its ability to  ensure hospice providers’ compliance with health and safety  requirements and quality of care for beneficiaries."
369,"Publication 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS e-file Providers of  Individual Income Tax Returns, which was updated in February 2019,  notes FTC’s role in protecting taxpayer data and generally describes  the requirement of implementing and maintaining a comprehensive  information security program, including the requirement that  administrative, technical, and physical safeguards be appropriate to  the business’s size, nature and scope of its activities, and the  sensitivity of the customer information.
We identified other IRS publications that are not exclusively related to the  Authorized e-file Provider program that discuss the requirements of the  FTC Safeguards Rule, as well as other information security measures  that serve as leading practices for the broader population of tax  professionals.
Without Congress providing IRS with explicit authority to regulate the  security requirements for the systems of paid preparers or Authorized e- file Providers, Congress and IRS have limited assurance that the  processes used by paid preparers or Authorized e-file Providers are  adequately protecting taxpayers’ information against electronic data  breaches and potential identity theft tax refund fraud.
Incorporating fundamental security controls into its  Authorized e-file Provider program would give IRS greater assurance that  tax software providers have identified and addressed information security  risks consistent with professional standards.
IRS Has Not Updated the  Authorized e-file Provider  Program’s Information  Security Standards for  Online Providers Since  2010 Online providers—tax software providers that allow individuals to prepare  their own tax returns—have additional requirements for security and  privacy that they must follow, as outlined in Publication 1345.
For example, IRS informs paid preparers, tax software  providers, and others about the importance of reporting security incidents  in a timely manner to help ensure that action can be taken quickly to help  protect their clients and avoid fraudulent returns being filed.
(Recommendation 2) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should require that all tax  software providers that participate in the Authorized e-file Provider  program follow the subset of NIST Special Publication 800-53 controls  that were agreed upon by the Security Summit participants."
370,"Each  state must develop, and submit to OCC for approval, a State Plan that  identifies the purposes for which CCDF funds will be spent for a 3-year  grant period and designates a lead agency responsible for administering  child-care programs.
According to OCC officials, the three main purposes of the  Monitoring System are to: (1) ensure compliance with the CCDBG Act,  CCDF regulations, and the approved State Plans; (2) identify state  technical-assistance needs; and (3) identify promising practices to inform  continuous quality improvement.
OCC’s lack of established written policies limits its ability to  ensure that staff follow appropriate protocols on a continuous basis when  implementing the State Plan review and approval process, and limits its  ability to provide a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate  the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel.
OCC officials told us that the State  Plans were approved without the information on the results of program- integrity activities because, although there are instructions in the Plan  Preprint for states to report this information, the CCDF regulations do not  require it.
In  response to a 2016 HHS OIG report, ACF officials said that OCC would  use the Self-Assessment Instrument to address the report’s  recommendations to request that states examine the effectiveness of  their program-integrity and fraud-fighting activities, and examine with  states the benefits of expanding such activities."
371,"The act includes requirements for OMB, OPM, and the 24  agencies listed in the CFO Act. PMIAA requires OMB’s Deputy Director for Management or the designee  to, among other things: adopt government-wide standards, policies, and guidelines for  program and project management for executive agencies; engage with the private sector to identify best practices in program  and project management that would improve federal program and  project management;  conduct portfolio reviews of agency programs not less than annually,  to assess the quality and effectiveness of program management, in  coordination with Program Management Improvement Officers  (PMIO); establish a 5-year strategic plan for program and project  conduct portfolio reviews of programs on our High-Risk List.
Overall, OPM’s role in implementing PMIAA is to establish a new job  series or update an existing job series by providing the occupational  standards that agencies will need to develop a trained and competent  workforce with the program and project management experience,  knowledge, and expertise to solve management challenges and support  agency decision-making.
Finally, GPRAMA required OMB to establish a number of  CAP goals intended to cover areas where increased cross-agency  collaboration is needed to improve progress towards shared, complex  policy or management objectives across the federal government.
OMB’s PMIAA Strategic  Plan Incorporated Leading  Practices OMB met the PMIAA requirement “to establish a five-year strategic plan  for program and project management.” The plan OMB developed details  three key strategies to implement PMIAA: (1) coordinated governance, (2)  regular OMB and agency engagement reviews, and (3) strengthening  program management capacity to build a capable program management  workforce.
OMB Leveraged Existing  Performance Reviews, but  Reviews Are Limited to  Major Acquisitions PMIAA requires agencies and OMB to regularly review portfolios of  programs to assess the quality and effectiveness of program  management and identify opportunities for performance improvement.
Further, according to OMB’s strategic plan, the purpose of the  pilot was (1) to determine how well agency program portfolios of non-IT  major acquisitions were performing throughout the life cycle of the  investment using a set of standards and practices, and (2) to refine the  process of coordinating program portfolio reviews as a component of  OMB agency strategic reviews.
OMB staff said that they  determined that the portfolio review process worked sufficiently well for  the pilot agencies and continued their planned strategy of focusing solely  on non-IT major acquisition programs for fiscal year 2019 portfolio  reviews.
According to OMB guidance, agencies were to report in  implementation plans how they are institutionalizing PMIAA efforts— especially PMIO responsibilities—into existing program and project  management practices.
Appendix I: Objective, Scope, and  Methodology This report examines: (1) the steps taken by the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the  Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies to implement the  Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAA); (2) the  extent to which OMB is using or planning to use portfolio reviews required  in PMIAA to address issues on our High-Risk List; and (3) the extent to  which OMB provided methods for agencies to assess the results of  PMIAA.
Implementation plans were evaluated on  whether they fully met, partially met, or did not meet the 10 requirements  provided in the OMB implementation guidance, such as how the major  acquisition portfolios aligned to relevant strategic objectives, or whether  the agency had existing training for program and project managers."
372,"Improved CMS  Oversight Is Needed  to Better Protect  Residents from Abuse In our June 2019 report, we found that, while abuse deficiencies cited in  nursing homes were relatively rare from 2013 through 2017, they became  more frequent during that time, with the largest increase in severe cases."
373,"As part of its  quality assurance efforts, VBA conducts national and individual reviews of  the accuracy of claims decisions, and periodic consistency studies to  assess claims processors’ knowledge of regulations and guidance on  specific claims processing issues, such as when to conduct  reevaluations.
VA uses national, regional office, and individual-level data  from its accuracy reviews to oversee the quality of rating claims  decisions, including reevaluations.
According to VBA officials, the agency uses information from its quality  reviews to provide additional guidance and training to regional offices.
As part of the reevaluation process to assess veterans’ conditions,  VBA procedures require claims processors in regional offices to conduct  a pre-exam review to determine whether a reevaluation is still appropriate  when its scheduled review date arrives (see fig.
In addition to this general training, VBA officials told us that VA added  controls to the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) system to  restrict claims processors’ ability to schedule potential reevaluations,  which could reduce the possibility of unqualified staff ordering  unwarranted exams during the pre-exam review.
With regard to recommendation 2 to use information on reevaluations to  improve program management, VA stated that VBA plans to expand its  review of existing data and reports to analyze trends regarding which  service-connected conditions are identified for reevaluation, and review  the outcomes or results of these reevaluations."
374,"Such evidence includes the following: proof of any requisite licensure or approval by an appropriate state- level licensing or approving agency; proof of accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the  Department of Education, if accreditation is required or otherwise  claimed; DSO’s attestation statement that he or she is familiar, and intends to  comply, with program rules and regulations for admission under, and  maintenance and change of, nonimmigrant student status; and  confirmation by the school that it is eligible for certification, among  other things (willful misstatements in a school certification petition may  constitute perjury); and DSOs’ proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent residency.
Once ICE has received a complete petition from a school seeking SEVP  certification, staff from SEVP’s Field Representative Unit are to conduct a  site visit to the school, including each instructional site foreign students  will attend, to interview school officials and review the facilities.
Further, these officials stated that many of the  components in a fraud risk profile are included in SEVP’s Risk  Assessment Tool, but this tool was developed to prioritize the review  of SEVP-certified schools that have potential compliance issues and  was not designed to address all SEVP fraud risks such as the risks  posed by students or brokers.
According to  ICE agents in four field offices and officials in the Compliance Unit,  limitations to SEVP’s ability to prevent some schools that present  fraud risks from obtaining certification or continuing to participate in  the program after fraud risks have been identified represent residual  risks to the program.
SEVP  officials stated that they address potential fraud risks during the initial  certification process by verifying the schools’ information and  documentation through web-based research and a site visit to interview  the school’s DSO and observe the school’s facilities.
For the remaining schools, SEVP issued a  formal recertification denial notice for a variety of reasons, including those  that highlight fraud risks in the program, such as  improper issuance of Forms I-20, including the issuance of forms to  foreign students who will not be enrolled in or carry a full course of  study; DSO conduct did not comply with program regulations; willful issuance by a DSO of a false statement;  failure to timely report school or course of study information, including  material changes; and  failure to maintain the accreditation or licensing necessary to qualify  graduates as represented in the school’s Form I-17.
According to Certification Unit officials, adjudicators review  information from both SEVP’s risk tools and field-representative  school-visit reports when adjudicating updates to identify any  indications of noncompliance or fraud that need to be further reviewed  and researched by the Compliance Unit.
We  reviewed documents including regulations, processes and procedures,  and guidance related to fraud risk management, school certification, and  recertification processes, and the role of DSOs. We evaluated the extent  to which ICE’s practices were consistent with Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government and GAO’s A Framework for  Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs."
375,"In addition, in April 2016, USAID and  State notified Congress of their intent to repurpose $215 million of fiscal  year 2015 supplemental Economic Support Fund Ebola funding for the  U.S. Zika response overseas, which included $78 million for CDC  international Zika activities.
The ability  to compile funding by country when responding to future infectious  disease outbreaks would enable USAID to provide key decision makers,  including Congress and agency officials, with additional information to  better support spending oversight and inform budgetary and planning  decisions.
To support raising public awareness of the risk of Zika virus and to  promote behavior change to reduce the spread of the disease, USAID  implementing partners such as the Red Cross and CARE told us that they  collaborated with communities, local government, and schools to  communicate information about Zika.
Second,  agency and implementing partner officials said that in some countries  without bilateral USAID health programs it also took time to identify the  appropriate points of contact and establish relationships—preliminary  steps needed to obtain approval from the host country government before  activities could get underway.
However, the plan does not provide specific guidance on how to  address the challenge of initiating emergency response activities in  countries without bilateral USAID health programs, such as by noting  particular practices that implementing partners and other officials can use  to address that challenge."
376,"According to CBP documents and officials, the process CBP  uses to enforce section 307 generally includes four phases: (1) assessing  leads to determine whether to initiate a case; (2) investigating cases; (3)  reviewing information for legal sufficiency to propose a WRO; and (4)  implementing the WRO and detaining shipments (see fig.
According to CBP officials, an analyst would examine,  for example, whether an allegation made by an external party is  credible, the goods in question are being imported into the United  States, and sufficient information is available on potential forced labor  to initiate and build a case.
CBP analysts investigate cases by collecting  information from various sources to help determine whether the  evidence “reasonably but not conclusively” indicates that goods being  imported into the United States were produced with forced labor,  according to CBP officials.
CBP officials said they may use reports  published by the Department of State for contextual information in  their enforcement of section 307, including investigation of cases  involving seafood."
377,"The ASD-SO/LIC’s current  statutory responsibilities include overall supervision, including policy and  resources, of special operations activities listed above; exercising  authority, direction, and control of all special operations-peculiar  administrative matters relating to the organization, training, and equipping  of SOF; and assisting the Secretary of Defense and USD (P) in the  development and supervision of policy, program planning and execution,  and allocation and use of resources for irregular warfare, combating  terrorism, and special operations activities.
For example, one of the actions  identified in the February 2019 monthly report was the need to enhance  OASD-SO/LIC’s role in the development and approval of SOF-related  program and budget matters.
Without establishing clear time  frames for the implementation of key oversight functions and other  actions, the ASD-SO/LIC may not be able to fully execute OASD- SO/LIC’s service secretary-like authority, and DOD decision-makers may  not be well positioned to track progress and evaluate whether or how the  ASD-SO/LIC’s completed and pending actions support the full  implementation of section 922.
Updating or developing guidance that clarifies  ASD SO/LIC’s relationship with DOD components, such as the military  departments, USD (P), and USD (P&R) would likely allow for improved  oversight of and collaboration on SOF matters related to personnel,  budgetary authority and SAPs. DOD partially concurred with the third recommendation that the ASD- SO/LIC  build upon its hiring plan by developing a strategic workforce  plan that incorporates key principles, such as aligning the plan with long- term mission goals; fully involving stakeholders in developing the plan;  and including strategies to address critical competency gaps and identify  related personnel requirements."
378,"The frameworks for fiscal years 2016 and  2017 state, “The United States is particularly interested in  ongoing  curriculum review process, which enables UNRWA’s educators to use  consistent criteria in analyzing and enriching local textbooks, in order to  promote UN values and principles in UNRWA classrooms.” The Secretary of State is required under Section 7048(d) of the  Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Appropriations Acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 to submit a report in  writing to the Committees on Appropriations not less than, and for fiscal  year 2016 no later than, 45 days after enactment.
USAID did not identify or address potentially  problematic content in Palestinian Authority textbooks between fiscal  years 2015 and 2017 because, according to USAID and State officials,  reviewing textbooks is outside the scope of the work of USAID’s partners,  including nongovernmental organizations, that implement projects in the  West Bank and Gaza.
Actions UNRWA Reported  Taking to Identify Content Not  Aligned with UN Values in  Textbooks UNRWA reported that it reviewed the Palestinian Authority and English  language textbooks in part based on the values contained in its  Framework for the Analysis and Quality Implementation of the Curriculum  (Curriculum Framework), through which UNRWA aims to ensure that the  curricula taught in its schools reflect UN values, such as neutrality,  tolerance, equality, and nondiscrimination, and human rights with regard  to race, gender, language, and religion.
Second, while State’s reports explain  generally how UNRWA is taking steps to ensure that educational  materials in UNRWA schools are consistent with certain values, we found  that the reports did not include some information about UNRWA’s  textbook review that could be useful for congressional oversight.
In the  annual appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 through 2017, Congress  required State to report on seven different topics, including whether  UNRWA is taking steps to ensure that the content of all educational  materials taught in UNRWA schools and summer camps is consistent  with the values of human rights, dignity, and tolerance, and does not  induce incitement.
(Recommendation 1) The Secretary of State should direct the Assistant Secretary for  Population, Refugees, and Migration to provide information in its reports  to Congress that could be useful for congressional oversight, including  information that: discusses whether Palestinian Authority textbooks used in UNRWA  schools are found to be consistent by UNRWA with the values of  human rights and tolerance.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report examines (1) the amount of funding Department of State  (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided  for education assistance to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015  through 2017 and how it was used; (2) how the United Nations Relief and  Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and  State have identified and addressed potentially problematic content in  educational materials used by schools in the West Bank and Gaza; and  (3) whether State has submitted required annual reports to Congress  including information on whether UNRWA is taking steps to ensure that  the content of all educational materials currently taught in UNRWA- administered schools is consistent with the values of human rights,  dignity, and tolerance, and do not induce incitement."
379,"Background Table 1 describes the activities that USDA’s mission areas and major  staff offices perform as part of five types of administrative services that  USDA business centers are to provide under the Secretary of  Agriculture’s November 2017 memorandum.
USDA Has  Developed Metrics for  Managing  Administrative  Services but Has Not  Assessed the  Effectiveness and  Impact of Its Business  Centers According to USDA’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration, the  department regularly reviews data on administrative services, including  services provided by the business centers."
380,"Once Inspection  testers complete all tests for a given scenario, Inspection develops  classified reports containing results of its quantitative analysis (including  detection rates for specific threat items) and suggested actions aimed at  addressing any identified vulnerabilities.
Nevertheless, without documenting in its work plans how  consequence and vulnerability are considered when determining which  scenarios to test, current Inspection program managers may not be able  to ensure that their scenario selection decisions are appropriately  accounting for risk as called for by DHS and TSA guidance.
To assist HET and FET teams in collecting more detailed information  from its new test program, in April 2016, Security Operations developed a  web-based data collection instrument called the Task Process Factor  (TPF) tool that TSA officials use to record more detailed information on  covert tests.
According to program officials, collecting more detailed  information about test failures was part of the agency’s effort to improve  screener performance following the DHS Inspector General’s 2015 covert  test findings that identified vulnerabilities in TSA’s checkpoint screening.
However,  documenting a risk-informed rationale for its selection of scenarios would  better enable Security Operations or an external party to assess TSA’s  covert test programs and ensure that decisions are appropriately  accounting for risk as called for by DHS and TSA guidance.
In addition, although  the TPF tool’s database contains information on the task, process, and  factors associated with each TSO test failure, Security Operations does  not typically include a comprehensive analysis of this information within  the monthly covert test reports it provides to TSA leadership at airports.
Security Operations officials agreed that conducting a more  comprehensive, national-level analysis, and utilizing more of the covert  test data currently within the TPF tool’s database, would be useful in  identifying system-wide vulnerabilities that could inform efforts to improve  TSO performance.
Security Operations  program managers stated that during these calls, they encourage TSA  officials not only to discuss particular issues or challenges they have  faced with respect to covert testing at their airports, but also to highlight  beneficial practices for conducting tests and using test results to improve  TSO performance that they and their teams have self-identified and  implemented."
381,"Specifically, Arch Coal, Peabody Energy,  and Walter Energy were also self-insured operators, but DOL officials  said that their federal black lung benefit liabilities were assumed by a  reorganized company or by a purchaser, and therefore did not transfer to  the Trust Fund.
DOL’s Limited  Oversight Has  Exposed the Trust  Fund to Financial  Risk, and Its New  Self-Insurance  Process Lacks  Enforcement  Procedures In overseeing coal mine operator self-insurance in the past, DOL did not  estimate future benefit liability when setting collateral or regularly review  operators to monitor their changing financial conditions."
382,"These  choices may instead reflect automatic spending growth (for example, in  response to population shifts or an increase in the number of people  eligible for government programs) or declines in revenue due to changes  in the economy (for example, a shift from goods to services without a  corresponding shift in the tax base).
In  every year between 1998 and 2018, state and local government taxes  (i.e., personal income, sales, excise, property, corporate, and other taxes)  comprised the largest category of receipts for the sector, providing about  $1.8 trillion or 69 percent of total revenues in 2018.
Public welfare spending showed the fastest growth among all  state and local government expenditure categories, growing at an  average annual rate of 4.9 percent per year during the period.
Expenditures on hospitals and health—which  include state and local government spending on public health and  hospitals, but not Medicaid—grew at an average rate of 2.6 percent per  year from 1997 to 2017.
Spending on public safety, which includes state and local  government services, such as police, fire protection, and corrections,  grew in all states at an average rate of 2.5 percent per year from 1997 to  2017.
Specifically, state and local government total tax revenues grew at a rate  of about 2.1 percent per year, on average."
383,"In accordance with these five goals, the MOU contains specific areas in  which VA and IHS agreed to collaborate and coordinate, including: Reimbursement: development of payment and reimbursement policies  and mechanisms to support care delivered to dually eligible AI/AN  veterans.
The leadership team also  compiles annual reports on progress in MOU implementation that  includes information about activities and challenges on meeting MOU  goals using established measures, and information on the reimbursement  agreements and outpatient pharmacy program.
In addition, VA and IHS  issue monthly data reports on the reimbursement agreements, including  the total amount disbursed, the number of veterans receiving services  reimbursed by VA, and the number of claims processed for IHS and THP  facilities.
The  VA, IHS, and THP facility officials we spoke with noted activities related to  the reimbursement agreements and a few noted improvements in areas  such as training and telehealth as a result of the MOU.
For example, officials said that the measures  related to the reimbursement agreements are dictated by the needs of the  population seeking health care and the providers at the IHS and THP  facilities."
384,"According to officials from OFAC and other partner agencies, key goals of  the Kingpin Act include disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking  organizations and blocking designees’ access to the U.S. financial  system.
On July 1st of each year, the OFAC Director, as delegated by the  Secretary of the Treasury, is required to submit a report to the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and  the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on the status of  sanctions imposed under the Kingpin Act, the personnel and resources  directed toward imposing sanctions under the Kingpin Act during the  preceding fiscal year, and background information with respect to the  newly identified significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their activities.
Treasury is also required to report on foreign persons who are sanctioned  under the Kingpin Act to the Director of the Office of National Drug  Control Policy (ONDCP); ONDCP is the Executive Branch office  responsible for issuing an annual National Drug Control Strategy and  coordinating the efforts of the National Drug Control Program agencies  implementing any aspects of the strategy.
OFAC and partner agency officials in Colombia credited host  government information sharing as a primary factor in OFAC’s ability to  complete evidentiary packages for Colombian targets and one reason  why OFAC has been able to investigate and designate more individuals  and entities in Colombia than in other countries.
The Kingpin  Act requires Treasury, no later than July 1 each year, to provide the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of  Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate  a report describing the status of sanctions imposed, including the  personnel and resources directed towards the imposition of such  sanctions during the preceding fiscal year, and providing background  information with respect to newly-identified significant foreign narcotics  traffickers and their activities."
385,"Congress  designed USPS to be a self-sustaining, business-like entity headed by a  Board of Governors that would cover its operating costs primarily with  revenues generated through the sales of postage and postal-related  products and services.
In addition to stakeholder opposition to changing postal services, federal  laws also factor into USPS’s limited ability to respond to declining mail  volumes.
Federal law requires USPS to provide  the maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural  areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self- sustaining.
USPS has  stated that it prioritizes its “primary universal service mission” when it is  unable to fulfill all of its financial obligations, and that it therefore did not  make payments to fund its postal retiree health benefits and pensions to  minimize the risk of running out of cash.
Based  on our review of the selected countries’ government reports, including  summaries of postal reform legislation, annual reports from foreign posts,  and interviews with foreign government officials and representatives of  foreign posts, we found that changes were made to foreign posts’: (1)  products and services; (2) financial self-sustainment; and (3) institutional  structure.
In addition, if Congress decides that USPS should be financially self- sustaining but makes no changes to improve USPS’s financial condition,  USPS will be unable to address unfunded liabilities for postal retiree  health and pension benefits, an inability that could eventually translate  into higher costs for future postal ratepayers.
For example, USPS could be  provided more flexibility to raise postal rates, introduce new nonpostal  products, and make various changes to reduce its costs such as  reducing the frequency of delivery or further consolidating its retail,  transportation, and processing networks.
However, we found that  USPS’s business model, which was to provide universal postal service  through self-supporting, business-like operations as an independent  establishment of the executive branch, was not viable due to USPS’s  inability to reduce costs sufficiently to respond to continuing declines in  mail volume and revenue."
386,"More specifically, NNSA took the following actions during the past decade  to identify alternatives for producing microelectronics beyond 2025:  In 2011, NNSA’s Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs  requested proposals from the agency’s three nuclear weapons  laboratories for flagship experimental science, technology, and  engineering facilities to help ensure that NNSA will have the  capabilities to address future national security needs.
Because the sustainment effort will last at  least 20 years, NNSA officials said that having a long-term planning  document that provides a current baseline for the condition of  Sandia’s microelectronics infrastructure and equipment, identifies  challenges, and recommends specific sustainment activities will be a  useful management tool.
In December 2019, NNSA officials provided us with  documentation stating that the agency plans to begin evaluating  options for a new microelectronics facility in 2021 with the goal of  completing construction in 2030, installing needed equipment in the  completed facility by 2033, and qualifying the production process and  begin producing microelectronics for integration into nuclear weapons  no later than 2035.
In particular and as applicable to front-end planning, NNSA’s and DOE’s  directives related to program and project management both include the  following controls: Appointment of a federal manager, who is vested with the authority to  carry out assigned responsibilities to meet program or project  milestones on schedule and on budget, who manages the  coordination of deliverables between the multiple entities (such as  different program offices) involved, and who is responsible and  accountable for planning, implementing, and executing a program or  project, which includes responsibility for developing an overarching  management plan; An overarching management plan, which establishes the procedures  to define, execute, and monitor a program or project, as well as  establishing specific requirements in a variety of areas—such as cost  estimating, an integrated schedule, performance management, and  risk management—to use to develop a baseline and against which to  measure and monitor; A mission need statement, which identifies a credible gap between  current capabilities and those needed to achieve the goals stated in  the strategic plan; and A requirements document that describes the ultimate goals the  program or project must satisfy while also identifying key assumptions  and constraints."
387,"Contingency plans for all selected agencies did not include complete  information about (1) flexibilities available to supervisors if furloughed  employees were unable to return to work on the day specified by the  agency, including use of annual leave, compensatory time off, or credit  hours; and (2) procedures for resuming program activities, including steps  to ensure appropriate oversight and disbursement of funds upon the end  of a shutdown, as specified in OMB’s guidance.
Information that was not provided includes: (1) a  breakout of exempt and excepted positions by category (e.g., available  budget authority, emergencies involving safety of human life or protection  of property, etc.); (2) summaries of activities that would or would not  continue during a lapse; (3) designation of personnel responsible for  implementing and adjusting the contingency plan if conditions change;  and (4) methods for notifying employees that the shutdown has ended  and when to return to work.
Examples of activities that  employees in these positions would support included: (1)  communications efforts through IRS websites, (2) end-of-month  financial operations, and (3) managing on-boarding for employees  hired under Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act. IRS officials said they knew about these operational changes at the  time of initial shutdown planning, but did not document all these  operational needs.
For the fiscal year 2020 contingency plan, CBP officials said that they  asked offices to analyze and communicate what, if any, additional  employees would be needed to work if a shutdown were to extend  past 5 days.
Documenting  roles and responsibilities would help USTR ensure that the  appropriate officials take the necessary steps to effectively prepare  and execute plans for future potential government shutdowns,  especially when officials currently familiar with the process no longer  work for USTR.
CBP and IRS Documented  Their Shutdown Preparation  Processes, but ITA and USTR  Did Not Internal Control Standards states that agency component management  should implement its control activities through policies.
Shutdown  preparation process documents at selected agency components included  descriptions of activities to complete prior to the shutdown, such as  updating and reviewing contingency plans, and preparing guidance and  communication for managers and employees, among other steps.
We reviewed shutdown  contingency plans and other planning documents at CBP, IRS, ITA, and  USTR to determine agency component processes for proposing,  reviewing, and approving operational changes during a government  shutdown."
388,"We also examined PBM revenue reported to CMS by Part D plan  sponsors in their rebates and other price concession data—also referred  to as direct and indirect remuneration (DIR)—in 2016, the most recent  data available at the time of our analysis.
Rebates and Other  Price Concessions  Grew Faster Than  Part D Expenditures  from 2014 through  2016 Growth in the amount of rebates and other price concessions provided by  manufacturers and others to Part D plan sponsors and PBMs outpaced  growth in gross and net Part D expenditures for all brand-name and  generic drugs from 2014 through 2016.
Net  expenditures reflect any rebates and discounts obtained by plan sponsors  and PBMs after a beneficiary receives a drug.
Rebates  are generally paid by manufacturers to Part D plan sponsors, or PBMs on  sponsors’ behalf, after a drug is purchased from a pharmacy.
Pharmacy-related price concessions, which include any monies obtained  by plan sponsors and PBMs from a pharmacy after a beneficiary  purchases a drug, accounted for nearly all the rest of rebates and other  price concessions—7 percent—in 2016.
For this group, gross Part D  prices—those paid to the pharmacy by the Part D plan sponsor, PBMs on  the sponsor’s behalf, and the beneficiary—were 17 percent lower than  manufacturer list prices for these drugs.
In interviews with representatives from PBMs, Part D plan  sponsors, and a manufacturer trade association, these stakeholders  generally agreed that utilization management services resulted in  financial savings.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This appendix provides details on our scope and methodology in  addressing each of our five reporting objectives: (1) the extent to which  Part D plan sponsors contract with pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) to  deliver drug benefit management services to Medicare beneficiaries; (2)  how PBMs earn revenue from the services they provide to Part D plan  sponsors; (3) trends in rebates and other price concessions obtained by  Part D plan sponsors and PBMs from manufacturers and others for Part  D drugs; (4) the extent to which prices for Part D drugs are discounted off  of manufacturer list prices; and (5) what is known about savings and other  effects from utilization management services commonly used in Part D.
The Extent to Which Part  D Plan Sponsors Contract  with PBMs to Deliver Drug  Benefit Management  Services to Beneficiaries To determine the extent to which PBMs provided services to Part D plan  sponsors, we analyzed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’  (CMS) Health Plan Management System (HPMS) data that identified the  entity or entities responsible for performing each of 10 key drug benefit  management services for plan sponsors’ Part D contracts in 2016, the  most recent available expenditure and rebate and other price concession  data at the time of our analysis.
Net expenditures  reflect any rebates and other price concessions obtained by Part D plan  sponsors and PBMs after a beneficiary receives a drug.
Stakeholder Perspectives  on the Effect of Utilization  Management on Financial  Savings, Beneficiary  Health, Medication  Adherence and Access to  Clinically Appropriate  Medications Most representatives of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), Part D plan  sponsors, and a manufacturer trade association we interviewed generally  agreed that utilization management services resulted in financial savings  by requiring the use of generic drugs.
Representatives of 10 of 14 plan  sponsors and six of eight PBMs we interviewed stated that utilization  management services generally resulted in financial savings.
Representatives of Part D plan sponsors and PBMs we interviewed  differed with manufacturers and, in some cases, with each other on the  effects of utilization management services on various non-financial  aspects of drug utilization: Beneficiary health.
Representatives from Part D plan sponsors, PBMs, and  manufacturers differed in their views on the effect of Part D utilization  management services restrictions on protected class drugs on  beneficiary health."
389,"Strategy-Related  Efforts Are Designed  to Support an  Enterprise-Wide  Approach, but  Implementation  Challenges Could  Limit Long-term  Success The National Biodefense Strategy and associated plans bring together all  the key elements of federal biodefense capabilities, which presents an  opportunity to identify gaps and consider enterprise-wide risk and  resources for investment trade-off decisions.
However, challenges with  planning to manage change, limited guidance and methods for analyzing  capabilities, and lack of clarity about decision-making processes, roles,  and responsibilities while adapting to a new enterprise-wide approach  could limit the success of the Strategy’s implementation.
The Strategy and  Associated Plans Create a  Framework to Assess  Enterprise-Wide National  Biodefense Capabilities for  the First Time The National Biodefense Strategy and its associated plans bring together  the efforts of federal agencies with significant biodefense roles,  responsibilities, and resources to address intentional, accidental, and  naturally-occurring threats.
Officials from three of the eight participating agencies that we  interviewed noted that this is the first time that the federal government  has identified activities across the whole biodefense enterprise and  assessed resources and gaps to address multiple sources of threat  regardless of source (naturally occurring, accidental, or intentional).
Additionally, agency officials said that the assessment and joint policy  guidance development process outlined in NSPM-14 offered some  promise for helping agencies identify the resources necessary to achieve  the Strategy’s goals, which is consistent with our national strategy criteria.
Additionally, officials said that key parts of the implementation  process, such as the finalization of metrics, milestones and end states, as  well as agreement on the federal agency roles and responsibilities for the  biodefense activities articulated in the Strategy, had not been approved  by the National Security Council staff.
In addition, without clear methods and guidance that articulate how all  relevant information should be analyzed, including ensuring nonfederal  roles, responsibilities, and resources are accounted for in the  assessment, the Biodefense Coordination Team’s ability to effectively use  the information to support enterprise risk management will be limited."
390,"We have previously reported that Navy  decisions to extend deployments can lead to maintenance challenges,  as these decisions have resulted in declining ship conditions across  the fleet, and have increased the amount of time that ships require to  complete maintenance in the shipyards.
However, the Navy does not always adhere to  its own maintenance planning process due to high operational tempo,  scheduling difficulties, or personnel shortages, among other factors,  resulting in shipyards discovering the need for additional repairs after  maintenance has begun and adding time to the schedule for planning,  contracting, or waiting for parts.
We reported in September 2017 that poor condition  of facilities and equipment at the shipyards contributed to  maintenance delays for aircraft carriers and submarines, hindering the  shipyards’ ability to support the Navy.

391,"(Appendix II describes CBP’s steps for filing and processing  drawback claims.) They also review and make determinations  concerning claimants’ (1) requests for drawback privileges for  accelerated payment and waiver of prior notice, (2) applications for  certain manufacturing rulings, and (3) protests of denied claims.
New claimants require additional work, including  drawback specialists’ manual reviews of claims, privilege applications,  and ruling requests, as follows.
Specifically, CBP expects three key changes to the drawback  process under modernization will strengthen its ability to validate claims  and recover inaccurately claimed drawback refunds: (1) requiring  electronic filing in ACE, (2) extending the record retention period, and (3)  broadening liability.
However, CBP officials told us that  claimants only provide proof of export upon request by the drawback  specialist, and that such requests typically are made after the claim is  accepted in ACE and only in the context of desk reviews.
Additionally, CBP’s estimate of expected increase in the number of claims  that would be filed under modernization contains several key assumptions  that it justifies based on emails and discussions with industry  representatives and CBP subject matter experts, the details of which are  not transparent in the RIA.
According to CBP, TFTEA modernized CBP’s system for processing  drawback claims, transitioning it from a paper-based to an electronic  system, in an attempt to mitigate longstanding risks in the program.
We also reviewed CBP’s internal guidance,  which defines the standards that drawback specialists must meet when  processing claims for drawback refunds in the Automated Commercial  Environment (ACE) and under TFTEA.
We also compared these data against  the historical number of drawback claims filed from 2009 through  2017, as reported by CBP in its Regulatory Impact Analysis of the  Modernized Drawback Final Rule (RIA).
Additionally, CBP officials said that before and after  modernization, if CBP identified compliance issues during its review of  a drawback claim, the drawback specialist could target any  subsequent claims filed by the claimant for a limited desk review."
392,"State agency officials also reported using formula funds, meant for broad  purposes like mental health, substance abuse, child welfare, and  education, to support their work with children affected by trauma.
Training State and local child welfare and education agency officials in the six  selected states use various approaches to train staff and birth and foster  parents about trauma and its effects on children and families.
According to the North Carolina child  welfare agency, the trauma screen has a number of benefits for child  welfare practice, including informing placement decisions for the youth,  prioritizing children who might need to receive treatment quickly, and  providing the mental health professional with a better understanding of a  child’s issues.
Support Systems State and local child welfare and education agency officials in five of six  selected states told us they have developed support systems, which can  include providing services, to try to help children affected by trauma."
393,"Existing Data are  Insufficient to  Determine if the Rate  of Filing  Whistleblower  Disclosures or  Retaliation  Complaints Varies by  Probationary Status The average annual total of probationary and permanent federal  employees from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 was approximately 1.9  million.
Specifically, OSC stated  that our report appears to connect the expected greater rate of  termination of probationary employees to whistleblower retaliation, based  on correlative data and without taking into account key factors such as  justification for the termination, timing in relation to the disclosure or the  filing of a complaint, or the merit of the individual’s complaint.
As stated in our draft report, and noted by OSC, our estimates  demonstrate that employees who file whistleblower disclosures and  complaints of retaliation are terminated at higher rates than employees  government-wide, and the estimates suggest that these differences may  be more pronounced for probationary employees."
394,"Over the course of the eight national workshops, EHR council members  were responsible for making EHR system configuration decisions in given clinical and  administrative areas and communicating them to Cerner; providing progress updates to VA’s EHRM program and VA  leadership; and notifying appropriate governing bodies (e.g., VHA program offices— such as the Office of Primary Care) of any local, state, federal, VISN,  and department policies that impact configuration decisions.
According to EHRM program officials, VA plans to hold local workshops in  advance of the Cerner EHR system implementation at future VA medical  facilities to focus on site-specific configuration decisions.
(See Appendix I for additional details on specific changes from November  2019 to March 2020 by EHR councils.) As noted earlier, though the workshop process has concluded, a VA  EHRM program official stated that they had plans to hold virtual—over  teleconference or videoconference—meetings to allow the EHR councils  to make remaining EHR system configuration decisions for capability set  1 at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center, by March 2020."
395,"Medicaid officials in the selected states told  us many of these challenges require ongoing monitoring and  collaboration with CMS and the companies offering D-SNPs. Difficulty using data to implement and evaluate aligned enrollment.
Medicaid officials in six of the selected states (Florida, Kansas, New  Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia) told us that using D-SNP  and Medicare data to implement and evaluate aligned enrollment policies  can be difficult.
Medicaid officials in five of the selected  states (Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia) told  us they have experienced challenges in ensuring that beneficiaries  receive quality information about their Medicare enrollment choices.
For  example, Tennessee Medicaid officials said that if a beneficiary who has  been default enrolled has a long-standing primary care provider with the  D-SNP’s aligned Medicaid MCO, the state requires the D-SNP to  continue covering services by that provider for at least 30 days and to  attempt to contract with the provider."
396,"Specifically, we conducted regression  analyses to examine the relationship between rates of opioid  prescriptions and DI claims at the county level from 2010 through 2017,  taking into account economic, demographic, and other factors.
For example, in one case file we  reviewed, an administrative law judge conducted a DAA evaluation  because of the claimant’s substance use disorders, likely involving  alcohol and prescription medications, including opioids.
However, program staff in five of the six offices we  visited in the three selected states, including DDS managers and  examiners participating in group interviews and three administrative  law judges, told us they believed they should not conduct a DAA  evaluation unless they see an official diagnosis documented in the  medical evidence.
For example, in one case file we reviewed, an  administrative law judge allowed a claim for mental health issues that  had previously been denied at the initial level as a result of the  claimant’s substance use disorders involving prescription opioids,  alcohol, and marijuana.
In addition, we analyzed  county-level data on the rates of opioid prescriptions from CDC and  number of DI claims from SSA from 2006 through 2017, the most recent  year of data available at the time of our review.
First, we  only selected case files for individuals who had been allowed benefits  during or after 2013, when SSA formalized its policies for evaluating  substance use disorders, including prescription opioids."
397,"Specifically, the various fraud risks we identified overall involved one or  more of the fraud risk factors illustrated in figure 3 below: opportunities to falsify self-reported information on applications or  financial pressures that potentially incentivized participants or  employees to commit fraud; opportunities to circumvent or take advantage of EXIM or lender opportunities to circumvent the intent of EXIM’s programs by diverting  loan proceeds and other EXIM financing for personal use or benefit  instead of for the export of U.S. goods.
§ 3720B, these results nonetheless indicate that the data in  SAM that indicate delinquent federal debt could provide an  opportunity for EXIM to identify important indicators of applicants or  other transaction participants with potential delinquent federal debt  when determining their program eligibility and assessing any related  fraud risks or repayment risks they present during EXIM’s  preauthorization CRTI reviews.
Thus, these results nonetheless illustrate that EXIM can use SAM  data during EXIM’s postauthorization CRTI reviews to identify  transaction participants with potential delinquent federal debt and  determine the extent to which they may pose a repayment fraud risk."
398,"In addition, we found that OIT does not have a process for ensuring that  states reporting staff salaries as their required cash match are not also  using grant funds from STEP to pay for portions of these same salaries."
399,"These contracts encompass the firm-fixed-price design, development,  test, and evaluation work needed to support NASA’s certification of the  contractors’ spacecraft, launch vehicle, and ground support systems and  begin operational missions to the ISS.
After the contractor has successfully completed its uncrewed and crewed  test flights and the above processes, the program determines at the  contractor’s certification milestone whether the crew transportation  system meets NASA’s requirements for human spaceflight.
However, based on current  schedules, the program must complete its reviews of certification  paperwork while supporting uncrewed, crewed, and abort system test  flights for both contractors before the end of 2019."
400,"Availability Execution  under the MAC-MO  Strategy Contracting for availability execution under the MAC-MO strategy differs  from that under the Navy’s previous strategy, known as Multi-Ship, Multi- Option (MSMO), in several key ways, including by calling for: establishment of fixed contractual prices and completion time frames  for an upcoming availability, rather than payment of contractors’  incurred costs; use of a third-party planning contractor under a cost-reimbursement  contract to define contract specifications, rather than relying on  planners employed by ship repair contractors;  and award of indefinite delivery contracts to multiple contractors that can  then compete for future availabilities, rather than all availabilities for a  particular class of ships going to one contractor.
In our November 2016  report on the Navy’s transition to the MAC-MO strategy, we described the  importance of contractors and RMC staff negotiating contract changes  and agreeing on costs in a timely manner in order to minimize schedule  impact.
In our current review, Navy officials stated that negotiating  change orders for unplanned work under MAC-MO is more difficult and  time consuming than under the prior MSMO strategy because the Navy  can no longer direct the contractor to continue to work without agreeing  on the cost.
According to NAVSEA leadership officials, the Navy primarily relies on  two activities to determine lessons learned and identify actions that  NAVSEA needs to take to improve ship repair maintenance, including  under the MAC-MO strategy.
However, RMC officials across the three ports implementing the MAC-MO  strategy expressed concerns over the quality of third-party planning  contractor specifications used in ship repair availability solicitations and  contracts.
The  NAVSEA officials noted that the contractor has also received annual  incentive fees for providing recommendations to the Master Specification  Catalog utilized by the Navy to incorporate lessons learned and improve  specifications written at all RMCs. Congressional Action  Offers Relief to the Navy’s  Lengthy Funding Approval  Processes, but Navy Does  Not Have Plans to Assess  Results Historically the Navy has used its operation and maintenance account to  pay for ship repair.
Navy Has Taken  Action to Enhance   the Predictability   of Increasing  Maintenance  Workloads in  Response to  Contractor Concerns Representatives of private ship repair contractors that the Navy relies on  to execute availabilities under the MAC-MO strategy told us that their  workforce and facilities investment decisions are driven by two key  considerations."
401,"OPM’s strategic human capital management regulations  require agency human capital policies and programs be based on  comprehensive workforce planning and analysis, and use comprehensive  data analytic methods and gap closure strategies to monitor and address  skill gaps within mission-critical occupations.
Some of the missing  leading practices discussed below—such as aligning plans with strategic  goals, identifying strategies to close workforce gaps, and monitoring and  evaluating those strategies—are also required by VA’s succession  planning directive.
Monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of strategies,  policies, programs, and activities is one of the key systems established in  OPM’s strategic human capital management regulations, and requires  agencies to identify, implement, and monitor process improvements.

402,"According to  officials, as part of this process, CSTC-A provides inputs, including  training requirements and associated funding needs, and later works with  various contracting commands to execute appropriated funds.
In the case of ASFF, CSTC-A’s guidance indicates that a proposed  activity (for example, fixed-wing pilot training classes) should generally be  included in the ASFF budget justification book in order to later use ASFF  funds for that activity."
403,"By fiscal year 2020, SBDCs were required to submit funding  applications based on the President’s budget request of $101 million,  which was 23 percent lower than the prior year’s appropriation.
According to a December 2019 letter from SBA to the Senate and House  Small Business Committees, the change to the funding estimate  methodology was adopted when the SBDC Program office identified  areas requiring process improvements and stronger internal controls to  help the program operate and plan more effectively and efficiently and in  consistency with federal financial management standards.
The following are examples of ways in  which the programs we reviewed differed from the SBDC Program: According to SBA officials, the funding for its Women’s Business  Centers is awarded at the end of the fiscal year, and thus the final  appropriation is known during the application process.
Fifty-one out of 58 SBDCs (88 percent) responding to our  survey question estimated that staff time to prepare the initial and final  2020 funding applications was somewhat or greatly increased compared  to previous years (when the estimated funding amount was approximately  the same as the current year’s award).
In response to the same open-ended question  asking for a brief description of how they made adjustments to account for  the decrease in the estimated funding amount in 2020, SBDCs provided  the following examples: One SBDC said that to maintain all of its full-time personnel within the  constraints of the initial application, some of its service centers had to  stop providing training classes or attending conferences."
404,"In  addition, we reviewed implementer progress reports for a sample of 19  projects to obtain more detailed information on project-specific outputs  and outcomes, as well as all available evaluations related to the six  sectors completed from fiscal years 2013 through 2018.
According to the PPRs we reviewed, USAID achieved  58 of 86 (67 percent) of its targets for performance indicators related  to this sector for fiscal years 2013 through 2018, and six of eight  evaluations of agricultural development projects generally reported  positive project results.
For example,  USAID in the PPRs reported that in Honduras it exceeded targets in  fiscal year 2018 by providing assistance to 94 local governments to  improve public service and by training over 2,600 individuals in  Guatemala in fiscal management to strengthen local government and  foster decentralization.
For  example, an evaluation of a USAID project in good government service in  Honduras that provided technical assistance to local governments to  improve citizen satisfaction with services reported improvements in the  quality of water and health services in most of the targeted municipalities,  although the evaluation noted that the project had not developed  appropriate indicators to measure results that were directly attributable to  the project’s activities.
A  comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan that specifies an approach  to evaluating progress across all agencies would help State and USAID to  determine to what extent U.S. government activities in the Northern  Triangle are achieving the Strategy’s desired results.
State indicated that the credibility of our report was limited by the  following five methodological issues: (1) our inclusion of projects  implemented by DOD and USDA; (2) our inclusion of projects  implemented with funds appropriated prior to fiscal year 2016; (3) our use  of inconsistent reporting methods for funding allocations among the four  State bureaus providing data and among State, USAID, DOD, and USDA;  (4) our classification of program sectors, which was not consistent with  the sub-objectives used by State and USAID as part of the Strategy; and  (5) our exclusion of several “primary” sectors for our in-depth review, such  as police professionalization, reducing violence at the local level, and  reducing the influence of organized crime and gangs.
To determine the projects that the U.S. government has implemented in  the Northern Triangle, we collected and analyzed agency project and  funding data concerning foreign assistance projects supporting prosperity,  governance, and security objectives from the U .S. Agency for  International Development (USAID), and the Departments of State  (State), Justice (DOJ), Homeland Security (DHS), Defense (DOD), and  Agriculture (USDA).
Appendix II: Summary of U.S. Assistance to  the Northern Triangle for Selected Sectors,  Fiscal Years 2013 through 2018 This appendix provides a summary of information on U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID), and the Departments of State  (State), Defense (DOD), and Agriculture (USDA) assistance projects in  the three Northern Triangle countries—El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras—to support the prosperity, governance, and security objectives  of the U.S. Strategy for Central America (Strategy) from fiscal years 2013  through 2018.
For each sector, we provide an overview and examples of  projects, including project objectives, activities, and results that State,  USAID, DOD, and USDA reported toward improving prosperity,  governance, and security in the Northern Triangle.
State, USAID, DOD, and USDA officials confirmed  that DOD and USDA projects support the objectives of the Strategy,  and we believe that the inclusion of these agencies enhanced the  accuracy and completeness of our reporting on the results that have  been achieved from U.S. assistance as well as the gaps in the current  monitoring and evaluation approach and implications for State’s ability  to assess results comprehensively."

407,"Officials from another state told us they frequently use targeted  reviews in response to complaints because these focus on a specific  issue, rely on more recent data, and are less time consuming than  more comprehensive market conduct examinations that review an  issuer’s compliance with all state health requirements.
According to DOL’s enforcement manual, DOL  investigators generally identify the reasons for starting each review,  obtain relevant information from the plan or issuer, and conduct a full  review of compliance with applicable federal health care laws.
These  reviews which are performed by DOL’s 10 regional offices can focus on  specific private, employer-sponsored group plans, service providers (such  as third party administrators), or issuers; however, DOL does not have  the authority to take direct enforcement actions against issuers for  violations of MH/SU parity requirements.
Nearly all DOL reviews that assess compliance with MH/SU parity  requirements originate from sources unrelated to MH/SU parity, including  complaints or other information about potential noncompliance with other  federal health care laws and DOL reviews of the annual financial and  operational information filed by employers, based on data provided by  DOL on the reasons targeted reviews were opened.
In light of these challenges, DOL  officials said they are focusing their targeted reviews on issuers and other  service providers to obtain voluntary corrections whenever possible so  they can address noncompliance across multiple private employer- sponsored group plans.
Specifically, CMS officials said CMS  does not have the authority to conduct random audits, reviews, or  examinations of employer-sponsored, non-federal governmental plans, or  to require the plans to provide documentation to demonstrate compliance  with MH/SU parity requirements.
DOL and CMS Do Not  Have Assurance That  Their Use of Targeted  Reviews to Oversee  MH/SU Parity  Requirements Is Effective  for Ensuring Parity Under DOL’s and CMS’s oversight through targeted reviews, self-funded  employer-sponsored group plans do not undergo review for compliance  with MH/SU parity requirements unless the agencies receive complaints  or other information about potential noncompliance with an applicable  federal health care law, or the review is opened as a result of a targeting  technique unrelated to MH/SU parity—such as bankruptcy filing review.
The study noted that plan documentation did not contain  sufficient information to fully assess compliance with MH/SU parity  requirements related to NQTLs.

408,"During our site visits to CMP’s southern headquarters in Anniston,  Alabama in August 2018 and November 2018 we observed CMP officials  processing applications from the public to purchase surplus firearms to  better understand how CMP addressed certain federal requirements and  agreements between the Army and CMP.
For fiscal years 2016 and 2017, TACOM  officials provided us with examples of the documentation from the current  system demonstrating that in addition to tracking CMP’s reimbursement  payments TACOM tracks reimbursable costs for transportation, standard  depot operations, and administrative support using five specific categories of information: travel, labor, commercial transportation, intra- Army purchases, and contract service.
According to CMP’s internal financial  documents, CMP generated $196.8 million in revenue from the sale of  surplus Army rifles during fiscal years 2008 through 2017.
CMP’s internal  financial documents showed $84.7 million in expenses to sell surplus  rifles in fiscal years 2008 through 2017, including costs associated with  labor, shipping, and other expenses to prepare the surplus firearms for  sale.
This is less than the $196.8 million CMP’s internal financial  documents show CMP generated in revenue from the sale of surplus  Army rifles during fiscal years 2008 through 2017.
This report (1) examines the Army’s and CMP’s  procedures to address requirements governing the transfer and sale of  firearms; (2) examines CMP’s primary sources of revenue, costs and  profits, and estimated future revenue associated with the sale of surplus  firearms; and (3) compares certain aspects of CMP’s business operations  with those of five selected youth-focused, federally chartered nonprofit  corporations  The scope of our review focused primarily on fiscal years 2008 through  2017."
409,"LM Faces Several  Challenges and Has  Not Planned for  Those That Require  New Cleanup Work or  Address Climate  Change Risks LM officials we interviewed identified a number of challenges that LM  faces in providing long-term surveillance and maintenance of sites.
By developing plans to assess  the effect of climate change on LM’s sites and to mitigate any significant  impacts, and, as part of these plans, incorporating principles from GAO’s  Disaster Resilience Framework, as appropriate, LM could better ensure  that its remedies will protect human health and the environment in the  long term.

410,"According to  PPE, the I-STEP program offers three main services: Exercise Management Services assist transportation operators,  emergency responders, local law enforcement, and government  officials in enhancing security preparedness and resilience; Training Support Services help partners improve security awareness,  training gaps, security plans, emergency procedures, and incident  management skills; and Security Planning Tools and Services help partners gain an  understanding of transportation security lessons learned and best  practices to inform risk-based decision-making."
411,"In  addition, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015  codified DOE’s role as the sector-specific agency for the energy  sector and gave DOE the authority to order emergency measures,  following a Presidential declaration of a grid security emergency,  to protect or restore the reliability of critical electric infrastructure.
NERC is  responsible for conducting reliability assessments and enforcing  mandatory standards to ensure the reliability of the bulk power system—a  term that refers to (1) facilities and control systems necessary for  operating the electric transmission network and (2) the output from certain  generation facilities needed for reliability.
U.S. Cybersecurity  Incidents Reportedly Have  Not Caused Power  Outages, and the Potential  Impacts from a  Cyberattack Are Uncertain According to the three entities responsible for collecting information on  cybersecurity incidents that affect the electric grid—DHS, DOE, and  NERC—none of the cybersecurity incidents reported in the United States  have disrupted the reliability or availability of the grid, and none have  resulted in a power outage.
Grid Entities Reported  Facing Challenges in  Addressing Cybersecurity  Risks Officials and representatives of key federal and nonfederal entities we  interviewed generally identified five significant challenges grid owners and  operators face in addressing cybersecurity risks: (1) difficulties in hiring a  sufficient cybersecurity workforce, (2) limited public-private information  sharing of classified information, (3) limited resources to invest in  cybersecurity protections, (4) reliance on other critical infrastructure that  may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, and (5) uncertainties about how to  implement cybersecurity standards and guidance.
Specifically, according to DOE’s Assessment of  Electricity Disruption Incident Response Capabilities, the electricity  subsector continues to face challenges in recruiting and maintaining  experts with strong knowledge of cybersecurity practices as well as  knowledge of industrial control systems supporting the grid.
Limited Public-Private Sharing  of Classified Information Officials and representatives of key federal and nonfederal entities we  interviewed identified limited public-private sharing of classified  information, including the sharing of threat intelligence, as a significant  challenge to addressing cybersecurity risks to the grid.
Until DOE ensures it has a plan aimed at  implementing the federal cybersecurity strategy relating to the grid that  addresses all of the key characteristics of a national strategy—including a  full assessment of cybersecurity risks—the guidance the plan provides  decision makers in allocating resources to address risks and challenges  will likely be limited.
In  addition, FERC has not evaluated the risk of a coordinated cyberattack on  geographically distributed targets in approving the threshold for which grid  cyber systems must comply with requirements in the full set of grid  cybersecurity standards.
FERC officials said they anticipate that a future update to the  approved cybersecurity standards may require the collection of relevant  data on suspicious cyber activity that could inform a threat scenario for  evaluating the potential impact of a coordinated cyberattack on  geographically distributed targets.
Without information on the risk of a coordinated cyberattack on  geographically distributed targets, FERC does not have assurance that its  approved threshold for mandatory compliance with all cybersecurity  standards adequately responds to that risk and sufficiently provides for  the reliable operation of the grid.
Specifically: The Secretary of Energy, in coordination with DHS and other relevant  stakeholders, should develop a plan aimed at implementing the  federal cybersecurity strategy for the electric grid and ensure that the  plan addresses the key characteristics of a national strategy, including  a full assessment of cybersecurity risks to the grid.
To address the second objective, we identified critical infrastructure  protection and regulatory actions that federal agencies are taking to  address grid cybersecurity risks by reviewing federal strategies, plans,  and reports describing activities that have been conducted or that are  under way and by interviewing the key federal and nonfederal entities to  obtain additional details on these activities."
412,"Background Role of Industry for  National Defense A series of laws and policy directives dating back to 1904 require DOD to  rely in large part on U.S.-flag commercial ships over government-owned  or foreign-flag ships for its sealift needs.
These  requirements and policies align with the following principles from the  Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended: A fleet of commercial ships with military utility that are owned and  operated by U.S. citizens and are able to provide reliable support  during difficult wartime missions is necessary for national defense.
DOT administers the MSP in  consultation with DOD, provides funding to federal and state maritime  academies, provides financial assistance to shipyards, and maintains  a fleet of 56 government-owned cargo ships in reserve to provide  sealift during war and national emergencies."
413,"According to OIS officials, to prepare the report, they obtained  data and information related to each NDAA metric from the administrative  records of the DHS components with primary responsibilities for border  security in the four domains.
In its fiscal  year 2017 Border Security Metrics Report, DHS provided information on  its methodological approaches, such as how it estimated undetected  unlawful entries.
For example, DHS’s fiscal year 2017 Border Security Metrics  Report scoped three metrics on unlawful border crossings between  POEs (the “attempted unlawful border crosser apprehension rate,” the  “estimated undetected unlawful entries,” and the “probability of  detection rate”) to only include data for the southwest border.
For  example, in May 2017 an independent review team assessed the  “migrant interdiction effectiveness in the maritime environment”  performance measure, which uses the same data as the border  security metric, “known maritime migrant flow rate.” The review team  found the measure to be complete and reliable and the data to be of  good quality overall, but also recommended that the Coast Guard and  DHS continue work on an improved database to enhance the  consistency of data collection, among other things.
DHS’s Model to  Estimate Unlawful  Border Entries Uses  Assumptions that  Have Not Been  Validated and Does  Not Convey  Uncertainty of  Estimates DHS Used a Statistical  Model to Estimate  Unlawful Border Entries  for Three Metrics Based upon statistical modelling, DHS developed a Model-based  Apprehension Rate to calculate the total number of unlawful border  entries between land POEs, including entries both detected by Border  Patrol and “estimated undetected unlawful entries.” DHS reported that in  fiscal year 2016 there were about 624,000 detected entries (which include  apprehensions, turn-backs, and got aways) and estimated that there were  about 62,000 undetected unlawful entries.
(2)  The “attempted unlawful border crosser apprehension rate,” which is  the estimated proportion of unlawful border entrants apprehended by  Border Patrol to the total number of unlawful entrants between land  POEs. DHS estimated that in fiscal year 2016, 65 percent of  individuals were apprehended by Border Patrol and 35 percent of  individuals attempting an unlawful border entry either got away or  entered the United States undetected.
This assumption  allows DHS to apply the estimated apprehension rate developed based  on a sample of Mexicans re-apprehended within 90 days—the group for  whom relevant data exist—to a broader population of individuals  regardless of the number of attempts the border crossers have made or  their nationality.
Specifically, using the Model- based Apprehension rate, DHS estimated that 65 percent of unlawful  border crossers were apprehended in fiscal year 2016, and the remaining  35 percent entered the United States.
(Recommendation 2) The Under Secretary for the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans should  include the results of sensitivity analyses to key assumptions in its  statistical models of unlawful entry estimates in its annual Border Security  Metrics Report.
Additional information and planned actions by the Department of Homeland  Security   According to DHS, officials are continuing to improve the accuracy of the existing statistical model for  estimating unlawful border crossers but are also considering alternative methodologies.
Differences between the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017  and the Department of Homeland Security’s report   As noted above for the metric “estimates of the impact of the Consequences Delivery System on recidivism,” DHS only included data for the southwest border because recidivism data for the northern border were not  available due to the small number of attempted illegal entries along the northern border.
Additional information and planned actions by the Department of Homeland  Security   DHS projected that the department may be able to include estimates on the number of inadmissible travelers  who successfully enter at a port of entry in its fiscal year 2019 Border Security Metrics Report to Congress."
414,"The additional decision support tools available on the MPF landing page  that beneficiaries may use to help select their Medicare health and drug  coverage include the following:  1.
CMS plans to provide more information to  the redesigned MPF to help beneficiaries understand their coverage  options and decide whether original Medicare or MA is right for them."
415,"Risk assessment also drives the application of additional reporting and  surveillance requirements—designed to help the program office monitor  cost and schedule performance—once DOD has awarded a cost-type  contract for an MDAP.
In addition to use of EVM data, contracting officials from the seven cost- type MDAP contracts included in our review noted the importance of  regular interactions between DOD—whether the program office, DCMA,  or SUPSHIP—and the contractor in order to proactively identify drivers of  cost or schedule overruns.
As shown in table 5 and based on analysis of the 21  programs, in general MDAPs that implemented certain knowledge  practices—thus reducing risk—before the start of system development  and critical design review had better unit cost and schedule outcomes  than those that did not.
Recommendation for  Executive Action The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment should  establish procedures requiring the military departments to collect and  share findings from their peer reviews of MDAP contracting approaches— including choice of contract type—such as by updating the existing online  compendium of best practices and lessons learned as they complete their  reviews."
416,"These provisions addressed a wide range of acquisition  issues, such as the:  creation of new processes for oversight of major defense acquisition  programs; development of streamlined alternative acquisition paths; and  changes to DOD’s other transaction authority, which allows DOD to  enter into agreements that generally do not follow a standard format  or include terms and conditions required in traditional mechanisms,  such as contracts or grants.
DOD issued a  policy for the process in November 2018, stating that stakeholders will  complete independent analyses in their areas of responsibility to  consider the aggregated risk regarding technical feasibility, cost,  schedule, and affordability, which will be submitted to the milestone  decision authority (typically at the military department level).
Subsequently, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and  Sustainment issued two additional interim guidance memorandums: the  first in October 2018, which described how the Office of the Secretary of  Defense and the Joint Staff would conduct oversight of the military  departments’ use of middle-tier acquisition pathways, and the second in  March 2019, which addressed sustainment planning considerations for  programs using the rapid fielding pathway.
DOD Guidance Does Not  Consistently Identify Business  Case Elements to Be  Developed and Considered for  Program Selection Statute requires that the guidance from the Office of the Secretary of  Defense include a “merit-based process” for considering potential middle- tier programs, although the interim guidance does not describe what the  process should include or what information should be considered by  decision makers to assess merit other than meeting the needs  communicated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant  commanders.
Without the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and  Sustainment identifying in its final guidance the minimum program  information needed to help decision makers evaluate the program’s  business case, DOD cannot ensure that the military departments are  consistently considering these types of information.
However, without the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment identifying in its  final guidance a minimum set of metrics that can be used to measure  performance of programs across the military departments, DOD risks not  knowing how the department’s portfolio of middle-tier programs is  progressing, including whether programs are on track to meet statutory  objectives for rapid prototyping and rapid fielding.
To identify the progress DOD has made to implement selected oversight  reforms for major defense acquisition programs, we analyzed three  selected reforms that affect processes related to DOD’s oversight of  major defense acquisition programs: designating military departments to be the milestone decision performing independent technical risk assessments; and establishing cost, fielding, and performance goals.
Further, we reviewed interim guidance from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and the military  departments to determine how DOD planned to measure middle-tier  program performance.
Office of the Secretary  of Defense officials told us they are working with the military  departments and other stakeholders to determine what information is  needed for oversight and portfolio management for middle-tier  acquisition programs."
417,"Under  the act, agencies are required to submit complete and accurate data to  USAspending.gov, and agency-reported award and financial information  is required to comply with the data standards established by OMB and  Treasury.
In November 2017, we issued our first report  on data quality, which identified issues with, and made related  recommendations about, the completeness and accuracy of the Q2  FY2017 data that agencies submitted, agencies’ use of data elements,  and Treasury’s presentation of the data on Beta.USAspending.gov.
According to Treasury officials, the agency’s data submission did not  include the spending of one of its component organizations—the Treasury  Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, Equitable Sharing Program— because OMB guidance does not allow for reporting aggregate  transactions when Primary Place of Performance, a required data  element, is at a multistate or nationwide level.
Overall Data Quality Is  Limited by Challenges in  the Implementation and  Use of Some Data  Standards The DATA Act requires OMB and Treasury to establish data standards to  produce consistent and comparable reporting of federal spending data.
While we found improvements in the overall completeness and accuracy  of the data when compared with the results of our 2017 review, we  identified persistent challenges with the implementation and use of two  award data elements—Award Description and Primary Place of  Performance Address that limit the usefulness of these data.
Officials from several agencies said it would be helpful for OMB and  Treasury to issue guidance on Primary Place of Performance Address for  financial assistance awards to help agencies report this information  consistent with the established standard.
We  recommended that OMB and Treasury provide agencies with additional  guidance to address potential clarity, consistency, or quality issues with  the definitions for specific data elements including Award Description and  Primary Place of Performance Address and that they clearly document  and communicate these actions to agencies providing these data as well  as to end-users.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We maintain that OMB and Treasury should address our prior  recommendations on DATA Act implementation, including  recommendations on monitoring agency submissions, providing  additional guidance on reporting established data standards,  implementing a systematic approach to facilitate the disclosure of known  data limitations on USAspending.gov, and developing a robust and  transparent governance structure.
To assess the timeliness, completeness, accuracy, and quality of the data  submitted and the implementation and use of data standards, we  analyzed agency submission files for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018  (Q4 FY2018) on USAspending.gov and reviewed a representative  stratified random sample from the Department of the Treasury’s  (Treasury) USAspending.gov database download for Q4 FY2018."
418,"Background  Types of Missions  Conducted by EOD  Forces The military services – Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps – have  highly trained EOD personnel to eliminate explosive hazards in support of  a variety of events and activities, ranging from major combat operations  and contingency operations overseas to assisting the Secret Service in its  protection of the President of the United States (see fig.1).
Ultimately, unless the  military services update appropriate guidance to ensure that they  consider the total EOD force required to support combat-related and  DSCA missions, decision makers cannot accurately assess the  sufficiency of EOD forces to meet both missions and the associated risks."
419,"The guidebook includes specific solutions for VA  medical centers struggling to provide same-day services in primary or  mental health care for veterans with urgent care needs:  Implementing open access in primary and mental health care:  Open access aims to balance the supply of (for example, available  appointments) and demand for (for example, the number of patients  assigned to a provider and annual visits per patient) services to  increase patient access.
According to VHA officials,  the key measure is based on the survey question that asks “in the last  6 months, when you contacted this provider’s office to get an  appointment for care you needed right away, how often did you get an  appointment as soon as you needed?” While SHEP scores provide  some data related to customer service and access to care, VHA has  not developed performance goals that sets targets for these or other  aspects of the same-day services initiative that would benefit from  monitoring.
Recommendation for  Executive Action The Under Secretary for Health should document same-day services  objectives and develop performance goals and related performance  measures to facilitate the periodic assessment of the impact of same-day  services on veterans’ access to care."
420,"The number of export license applications for  firearms, artillery, and ammunition remained relatively constant from fiscal  years 2013 to 2017, averaging 13,738 annually, even as the total number  of licenses reviewed by State declined as the export control reform  process transferred items from State to Commerce control (see fig.
According to Commerce officials, because State has been responsible for  export controls of firearms, artillery, and ammunition, its internal watch list  is also more likely than Commerce’s to include derogatory information  collected from past screening and end-use monitoring related to exports  of these items.
The statement says that among other factors, the “export control  system must ensure that it is transparent, predictable, and timely, has the  flexibility to be adapted to address new threats in the future, and allows  seamless access to and sharing of export control information among all  relevant United States national security and foreign policy agencies.”  Without access to State’s watch list, if the proposed rules are finalized,  Commerce may lack critical information needed to effectively screen  license applicants for firearms and related exports and target possible  cases for end-use monitoring to ensure that these exports are used as  intended and by legitimate end-users.
Conclusions If finalized, the proposed rules to transfer certain firearms, artillery, and  ammunition from Categories I-III of the USML to the CCL would apply  Commerce’s export control system to these items instead of State’s.
Further, because State has been  responsible for export controls of firearms, artillery, and ammunition, its  watch list is more likely than Commerce’s to include derogatory  information collected from past screening and end-use monitoring related  to exports of these items, according to Commerce officials."
421,"In 2014 we reviewed the WOSB program and found a number of  deficiencies in SBA’s oversight of the four SBA-approved third-party  certifiers and in SBA’s eligibility examination processes, and we made  related recommendations for SBA.
However, as of early  May 2019, SBA had not fully implemented comprehensive procedures to  monitor the performance of the WOSB program’s third-party certifiers and  had not taken steps to provide reasonable assurance that only eligible  businesses obtain WOSB set-aside contracts, as recommended in our  2014 report."

423,"In 2013, VHA’s National Surgery Office established TRACER to track and  monitor the referrals, evaluations, and outcomes for organ transplants  performed at the VATCs. Referring VHA medical centers use the  database to enter a referral for a veteran to be evaluated at a VATC; and  VATCs use it to record referral reviews, patient evaluations, transplant  outcomes, and follow-up care.
In addition, the database provides the  National Surgery Office with information used to monitor transplant  volumes, the referral and evaluation process, and clinical outcomes  across all VATCs. The VA Organ Transplant Program’s services include  pre-transplant evaluation and testing, transplant surgery, post-transplant  follow-up care, as well as transplant-related round-trip travel and lodging  for both the veteran and a caregiver.
Following the initial screening, if VHA medical center providers determine  that the veteran is a potential candidate for a transplant, they enter the  checklist information into the TRACER database, include the results of  the required assessments outlined in the checklist, and attach any  additional medical information, such as testing performed through care in  the community.
Timeliness of Potential  Transplant Candidate  Evaluations Improved  From Fiscal Years 2014  through 2018, but Some  Delays Remain In addition to timeliness requirements for referral review, VHA requires  that VATCs complete an evaluation of veterans within 30 calendar days  of receiving a referral to determine whether they are a candidate for  transplant and should be placed on the national organ donation waitlist."
424,"DHS Has Made  Progress Addressing  Past Challenges, But  Some Actions are Still  Under Way Our past work has identified progress and challenges in a number of  areas related to DHS’s management of the CFATS program, including (1)  the process for identifying high-risk chemical facilities; (2) how it assesses  risk and prioritizes facilities; (3) reviewing and approving facility site  security plans; (4) inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance; and (5)  efforts to conduct outreach with stakeholders and first responders."
425,"Changes to the  Legislative and  Regulatory  Framework  Governing Contract  Financing since 1985 Since the DFAIR commission issued its report in 1985, Congress and  DOD have made a number of changes to the statutory and regulatory  framework intended to (1) reduce the administrative burden associated  with contract financing and (2) encourage the use of performance-based  payments (see figure 2).
In December 2018, DPC  officials acknowledged the need to assess contract financing policies  against market and economic conditions on an ongoing basis and  determine the effect these policies have on the defense industry, but did  not provide a timeframe for doing so.
DOD officials acknowledged that the department has not done a  comprehensive assessment of how its contract financing policies affect  the defense industry since the DFAIR study was issued in 1985."
426,"CRDC Business Rule  Targeting Illogical Data Is  Largely Ineffective Education has a business rule that identifies illogical data; that is, when  schools report more students affected than incidents of either restraint or  seclusion.
These school districts all reported  incidents of restraint and seclusion in 2015-16, but officials we  interviewed differed in their interpretations of terms used in the CRDC  definitions, such as alone and escort.
Officials in several districts told us that collecting and  reviewing data on restraint and seclusion helps them identify patterns in  staff and student behavior that may contribute to use of these practices.
Officials in several districts said they examine data on  restraint and seclusion at the classroom and school level to determine if  staff need additional training, including on how to manage student  behavior, or appropriately use restraint or seclusion.
Below are the details of our analysis to determine the  extent to which Education ensures the quality of restraint and seclusion  data reported by school districts, and of our interviews with officials in  selected districts about how they apply Civil Rights Data Collection  (CRDC) definitions of restraint and seclusion and use restraint and  seclusion data.
Analysis of National Restraint and Seclusion Data  To determine the extent to which Education ensures the quality of  restraint and seclusion data reported by school districts, we analyzed  Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) for school year 2015-16."
427,"However, they do not incorporate  practices on developing monitoring plans that are based on risks,  ensuring that staff are appropriately qualified to conduct monitoring,  establish procedures to close out programs, developing staff skills for  evaluation, and following up on evaluation recommendations.
The OMB Guidelines do not incorporate practices on developing  monitoring plans that are based on risks, ensuring that staff are  appropriately qualified to conduct monitoring, and establishing close-out  procedures for projects and programs.
Specifically, FATAA states, “the President shall set forth  guidelines, according to best practices of monitoring and evaluation  studies and analyses, for the establishment of measurable goals,  performance metrics, and monitoring and evaluation plans that agencies  can apply with reasonable consistency to covered United States foreign  assistance.” OMB staff told us that the Guidelines were intended to focus on elements  required by the FATAA legislation but noted that agencies are free to add  additional requirements to their own M&E policies.
The Director of the Office of Management of Budget should update the  Guidelines to include GAO’s leading practices of developing monitoring  plans that are based on risks, ensuring that monitoring staff have  appropriate qualifications, establishing procedures to close-out programs,  developing staff skills regarding evaluations, and establishing  mechanisms for following up on evaluation recommendations.
We also interviewed relevant OMB officials  in Washington D.C. involved in developing the memorandum and inquired  about specific requirements and plans to ensure the implementation of  these Guidelines."

429,"If program officials identify any functions  that are closely associated with inherently governmental in the  proposed requirement, the job aid includes a narrative section where  the program official is expected to input information on the nature of  the work to be performed by the contractor and how heightened  management attention will be given.
We recommended that the National  Nuclear Security Administration report on all professional support  services contracts with obligations as part of its budget justification  materials, ensure contracting officers document plans to oversee  service contracts at risk of performing inherently governmental  functions, and develop a process to ensure that contracting officers  are carrying out planned oversight.
Further, if a function is closely associated with  inherently governmental, the job aid includes a narrative section where  the program office should document mitigation strategies to ensure  heightened management attention and enhanced oversight occur  throughout the life of the contract.
In addition, the job aid does not require program officials to analyze or  document the expected federal personnel necessary to perform or  oversee service requirements in need of heightened management  attention following contract award; therefore information available for  planning purposes is limited.
Further,  changes in DHS’s processes and a lack of agency-wide guidance for  planning, documenting, and updating federal oversight personnel and  activities for services in need of heightened management attention have  put the department at risk of not effectively addressing whether  contractors are performing inherently governmental functions.
(Recommendation 3) The Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the DHS Chief  Procurement Officer to update the Inherently Governmental and Critical  Functions Analysis to provide guidance for analyzing, documenting, and  updating the federal workforce needed to perform or oversee service  contracts requiring heightened management attention.
(Recommendation  4) The Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the DHS Chief  Procurement Officer to develop guidance identifying oversight tasks or  safeguards personnel can perform, when needed, to mitigate the risk  associated with contracts containing closely associated with inherently  governmental functions, special interest functions, or critical functions.
DHS did not agree with the fourth recommendation, that OCPO should  update the Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions Analysis job  aid to provide guidance for analyzing, documenting, and updating the  federal workforce needed to perform or oversee service contracts  requiring heightened management attention."
430,"For example, FDA may require drug  companies to give patients and health care providers additional  information to reinforce certain safe use conditions or specific risks  described in the approved labeling of a certain drug.
A generic company may request a  waiver from FDA, which if granted, would allow the generic company to  develop a separate system that includes the same ETASU measures  required for the reference listed drug.
The  draft guidance explains how FDA could send a letter stating that the  agency had reviewed the generic company’s plans for its  bioequivalence testing and determined that these plans included  safety measures that were comparable to those in the ETASU  measures for the reference standard drug.

Based on best  practices identified by GAO, without an independent Technology  Readiness Assessment, Test and Evaluation Master Plan, or an  Independent Cost Estimate, program officials cannot have a high level of  confidence that the requirements are firm and that risk has been  adequately reduced before beginning efforts estimated to cost $10.5  billion in funding to develop Block 4.
To address this risk, in April 2019, we recommended to the DOD that it  should ensure the F-35 program office complete its business case, to  include the three documents discussed above, at least for the initial Block  4 capabilities under development before initiating additional development  work."
432,"In addition to DOD leadership emphasis, command officials credited  DCPAS and the military departments’ civilian personnel centers for taking  actions to help DOD increase its use of direct hire authorities.
While these time-to-hire metrics could be helpful in determining which  direct hire authorities most effectively expedite the hiring process, HCI  officials told us they do not use these metrics to inform management  decisions for the civilian acquisition workforce because they are not yet  consistently measured.
This report: (1) provides information on DOD’s use of available hiring,  recruitment, and retention flexibilities for its civilian acquisition workforce  personnel from fiscal years 2014 to 2018; and (2) determines the extent  to which DOD has monitored and assessed its use of hiring, recruitment,  and retention flexibilities for its civilian acquisition workforce.
We also identified factors that affected DOD’s use of hiring, recruitment,  and retention flexibilities for its civilian acquisition workforce by reviewing  DCPAS and military departments’ policies and guidance for using human  capital flexibilities, including implementation of 14 DOD direct hire  authorities provided in statute, and efforts by DCPAS to improve DOD’s  use of the flexibilities.
To determine the extent to which DOD has monitored and assessed its  use of hiring, recruitment, and retention flexibilities for its civilian  acquisition workforce, we reviewed acquisition workforce human capital  plans from the Office of Human Capital Initiatives (HCI) within USD for  Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S); acquisition workforce plans from the  Air Force, the Army, and the Navy; and data and metrics collected by HCI  and DOD’s four Directors for Acquisition Career Management (DACM)— one for each of the military departments and a fourth for the defense  agencies and field activities outside the military departments."

To accurately plan for aviation depot maintenance, Air Force Materiel  Command officials told us they had implemented three key initiatives  including: Conducting early inspections: Air Force officials stated that they have  been conducting pre-inspections of selected aircraft a year before  scheduled maintenance to check for unplanned maintenance needs,  and to ensure the availability of parts.
Air Force Materiel Command officials stated that the metric has  helped them identify factors affecting the differences between planned  and actual aircraft entering the depots for maintenance and to adjust  resources when needed to address the workload.

To create  the list of potential class members (that is, those parents of a separated  child covered under the lawsuit) eligible for reunification per the June  2018 court order, DHS and HHS officials told us that they generated the  list based on children who were in DHS or HHS custody on that date.
Parents of children who were separated at the border but whose children  were released by ORR to sponsors prior to the June 2018 court order  were not considered class members, and according to HHS officials, the  department was not obligated to reunite them with the parent or parents  from whom they were separated."

440,"Several FAA offices—with staff in D.C. headquarters, FAA regional  offices, and local district offices—oversee terminal area safety, including: The Air Traffic Organization (ATO) manages air traffic control,  validates reports of terminal area incidents, develops and maintains  runway safety technology, and leads investigations of operational  incidents.
For example,  FAA’s order establishing the Runway Safety Program states that FAA use  SMS to ensure the safety of the national airspace through evaluations,  data tracking, and analysis of incidents to identify new hazards and risks,  and to assess existing safety controls.
Runway Safety-Related  Programs FAA’s primary runway and taxiway safety effort is the Runway Safety  Program, whereby staff develop national and regional runway safety  plans, analyze data on runway and taxiway incidents, and help local air  traffic control managers organize annual Runway Safety Action Team  (RSAT) meetings at which FAA, airport operator, and other stakeholders  at each airport discuss recent runway and taxiway incidents."
441,"The Reform Act also required OCWR to use  SOCRATES data to assess the effectiveness of ADR procedures in  resolving claims in a timely manner and to publish these assessments  in semi-annual reports to Congress.
For example, OCWR  has a long-term strategic goal to “provide an efficient and effective ADR  program.” A supporting initiative is to “ensure that ADR processes meet  statutory and regulatory mandates, including mandates for maintaining  confidentiality.” However, this initiative does not state what is to be  achieved and by when, and none of the supporting initiatives reflect near- term performance goals that allow for an objective assessment of  progress.
Through the Reform Act’s requirement to conduct a workplace climate  survey every 2 years, OCWR has new opportunities to collect data on the  extent to which legislative branch employees are aware of OCWR’s  services and their rights under the CAA.
OCWR Could Better  Support IT Initiatives  with Strategic  Planning and Human  Capital Management In 2004, we reviewed OCWR’s management practices and made 20  recommendations to help OCWR:  strengthen strategic planning and develop results-oriented  performance measures; ensure an effective, results-oriented program structure; build effective communication emphasizing outreach and coordination  with congressional and legislative branch stakeholders; and  create and sustain an enhanced management control environment,  particularly for managing human capital and performance."
442,"ONRR issued a fiscal year 2017 strategic priorities document that  contains the agency’s mission statement: “to collect, account for, and  verify natural resource and energy revenues due to states, American  Indians, and the U.S. Treasury.” ONRR stated in the document that it  planned to achieve Interior’s strategic goals to (1) timely disburse 98  percent of federal and Indian revenues, (2) close 85 percent of Interior’s  OIG and GAO recommendations targeted for implementation in fiscal  year 2017, and (3) report results of ONRR’s supporting performance  measures for Interior’s strategic goals on total ONRR compliance  collections and a 3-year average compliance return on investment.
By establishing a coverage goal  (e.g., identifying the number of companies or percentage of royalties  subject to compliance activities over a set period of time) that aligns with  the agency’s mission and tracking the extent to which each of its  compliance activities contributes toward this goal, ONRR would have  greater assurance that its compliance program has the capability to  accurately determine oil and gas royalties.
According to ONRR officials, ONRR’s  Work Planning Group reviews royalty information on federal oil and gas  leases and selects leases from specific companies or properties to  undergo either an audit or a compliance review.
For audits, ONRR officials we interviewed told us that cases are generally  selected based on research from ONRR’s recently established Analytics  and Risk Management group, which includes the relocated Work  Planning Group and other offices that analyze particular aspects of the oil  and gas industry, such as pricing.
According to the officials,  the Work Planning Group then compares the list of companies and  properties to other sources of information, such as the findings of recently  completed work and ONRR’s royalty compliance risk model, to select  cases based on the group’s professional judgment.
As  mentioned previously, ONRR’s fiscal year 2017 goals for its compliance  program are to achieve a specified return on investment and total amount  of additional royalties collected from the cases it selects to undergo  compliance activities.
Specifically, officials from all nine STRAC member states we  interviewed said that either they did not have, or were unable to provide,  documented procedures for the processes they used to select federal oil  and gas compliance cases."
443,"Compacts of Free  Association Economic Assistance  Provisions Under its compacts with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, the  United States provided economic assistance that includes access to  certain federal services and programs, among other things, for defined  time periods.
The compact of free association  between the United States and Palau entered into force in 1994 and  provided $574 million in funding through Interior for fiscal years 1995  through 2009 for assistance to the government, contributions to a trust  fund, construction of a road, and federal services.
During the period 2013 to 2018, an estimated 94,399 compact  migrants lived in U.S. areas, according to combined data from the  Census Bureau’s 2013-2017 American Community Survey and 2018  required enumeration in Guam, the CNMI, and American Samoa.
The Census Bureau estimated that 11 states in the U.S. mainland, in  addition to three of the four affected jurisdictions—Hawaii, Guam, and the  CNMI—had compact migrant populations of more than 1,000, according  to the 2013-2017 American Community Survey and the 2018  enumeration (see fig.
In some communities we visited, stakeholders  noted that FAS citizens had come to the United States for school or work  before the compact with Micronesia and the Marshall Islands and the  compact with Palau went into effect but that the compacts had opened  the option of migration to a broader range of individuals.
U.S. Area Governments  Identify Effects of  Providing Programs and  Services to Compact  Migrants Education Children of compact migrants attending U.S. public primary and  secondary schools sometimes receive additional or specialized services,  such as support for English language learners, according to state and  territorial officials.
Hansen’s disease affects some members of  compact migrant communities, according to health care providers and  state government officials.
Agency Comments,  Third-Party Views,  and Our Evaluation We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services,  Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, State,  and Transportation; the Social Security Administration; the Governors of  Hawaii, Guam, the CNMI, Arkansas, Oregon, and Washington; and the  Ambassadors of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau to the  United States.
The special  tabulations of ACS data and the Census Bureau’s 2013 and 2018  enumeration reports defined compact migrants as individuals residing in  U.S. areas who were born in the FASs and entered the United States  after 1986 (for Micronesia and the Marshall Islands) or 1994 (for Palau)  and their U.S.-born children (biological, adopted, step-) and grandchildren  younger than 18 years.
Stakeholders we interviewed included  officials from nine federal agencies; state and territorial government  officials in areas we visited; private sector and nonprofit organization  representatives such as chambers of commerce, employers of  compact migrants, and nonprofit service providers; officials from the  FAS embassies and consulates or honorary consuls in areas we  visited; and compact migrants living in areas we visited (see table  8).
Data for U.S. areas not covered by the  American Community Survey, including Guam, the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Samoa, are from  compact migration enumerations that the Census Bureau performed on  behalf of the Department of the Interior.
Table 11  provides Census Bureau estimates, using 2013-2017 American  Community Survey data, of the numbers of compact migrants born in the  freely associated states—the Federated States of Micronesia, the  Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau—and residing  in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
State government officials, nonprofit representatives, and FAS community  members said that more federal funding and resources were needed to  accommodate the compact migrant population or to support the receiving  states and territories."
444,"In addition, the INA provides DHS with discretionary authority  to grant parole to certain noncitizens, on a case-by-case basis, allowing  them to be temporarily present in the United States, including the CNMI."
445,"Over the years, GAO, NRC’s OIG, and NRC internal initiatives identified  several key findings and made recommendations to improve NRC’s billing  process, including the following: NRC began an initiative aimed at improving its billing codes in 2013,  and in 2017, NRC’s Cost Accountability and Management Project plan  stated that NRC’s methods for requesting and managing billing codes  place the agency at risk of collecting inaccurate data.
In 2016, NRC’s Fees Transformation Initiative recommended process  improvements related to the information NRC provides to licensees  through cost estimates and on invoices.
Relatedly, in 2015, NRC’s OIG recommended that NRC design and  implement a process to provide information regarding contractor  charges on invoices that identifies the specific tasks performed and  related reimbursable contractor costs.
NRC improved transparency by standardizing its billing  codes, updating its invoices, formally communicating some supplemental  billing information, and creating public cost estimates, but it has not  ensured the estimates clearly define what costs are included or provided  work progress information throughout the course of ongoing regulatory  activities.
Formalizing when NRC staff are to  communicate information to licensees on the progress of work performed  could enhance transparency and make planning and budgeting easier for  licensees, as they would have more information about when an action is  expected to be completed or when it will cost more than NRC’s initial  estimate."
446,"Upon apprehension of individuals at or between ports of entry, Border  Patrol agents and OFO officers generally decide whether to (1) place  apprehended adults and family units into expedited removal proceedings,  or (2) initiate full immigration proceedings, according to CBP officials.
If  agents or officers place individuals into expedited removal proceedings,  CBP will transfer them to DHS’s U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) for longer-term detention (see appendix II for more  information on eligibility, screening standards, and possible screening  outcomes for credible and reasonable fear cases).
According to EOIR data,  from fiscal year 2014 through the third quarter of 2019 (the most recent  data available at the time of our analysis), EOIR’s immigration judges, at  the noncitizens’ requests, reviewed about 55,000 cases in which USCIS  asylum officers made a negative credible or reasonable fear  determination (see figure 4).
According to USCIS policy, asylum officers are to record key information  about the applicant’s claim, as well as specific details of the  determination, on required forms that serve as the official record of the  credible or reasonable fear screening.
However, Asylum Division officials said it is important for  individual asylum offices to provide additional, on-the-job training to new  officers assigned to screen credible and reasonable fear cases,  specifically.
For example, some asylum offices have  developed formal presentations on local policies and procedures, or  provide officers with an opportunity to observe other officers conducting  credible or reasonable fear interviews and gradually increase the number  of cases they screen per day.
USCIS data indicate that asylum officers screened more than 141,000  credible fear cases at ICE’s four family residential centers between fiscal  years 2014 and the first two quarters of 2019 (see table 3).
Without complete data in its case management system on all  outcomes of credible fear screenings at family residential centers, USCIS  is not well-positioned to report on the scope of either the agency’s policy  for family members who are treated as dependents, pursuant to  regulation, or USCIS’s use of discretion in the interest of family unity.
USCIS  regulation does not require that credible fear cases be completed in a  specific time frame; however, Asylum Division headquarters officials said  they have used timeliness goals to help monitor their credible fear  workload.
Asylum officers in  Arlington said they are expected to conduct a certain number of credible  or reasonable fear screenings per day, but expectations for completing  their assigned cases may be tempered by circumstances such as  interpreter availability or if there are issues at the detention facility,  including physical space shortfalls or difficulty in locating the individual at  the facility.
For our analysis of USCIS data specifically for ICE  detention facilities and family residential centers, we only included  credible and reasonable fear cases for detained individuals."
447,"Examples of machine learning applications of AI:  software that uses a training dataset to “learn” how to read information  from a form filled out by a person;  collaborative robots that can sense when they touch a physical  obstruction and shut down to safely work alongside humans;  industrial robots with machine vision incorporated to identify and pick  up specific parts from a collection of randomly strewn pieces; and automated guided vehicles that transport materials around a  production plant and use cameras and radar to navigate  independently and re-route around obstacles.
Projected Workforce  Effects of Advanced  Technologies While national employment data measure jobs and workers by occupation  and industry, the adoption of advanced technologies generally affects  specific work tasks, and can materialize in a variety of ways.
By analyzing tasks within jobs or occupations to determine their  susceptibility to automation, a number of studies have developed models  to estimate the future workforce effects of advanced technology adoption.
Employment Trends and  Characteristics of Workers  in Jobs Susceptible to  Automation In the absence of comprehensive data that definitively link employment  trends to technology adoption, we analyzed occupations that researchers  Frey and Osborne identified as being susceptible to automation (see  sidebar) to determine whether changes due to advanced technologies are  appearing in employment data.
There could be a number of reasons we did not find a  relationship between susceptibility to automation and employment  changes in both of these analyses, including: a relationship does not exist;  such a relationship is too complex to measure in this way (e.g.,  automation may lead to decreases in employment in some industries,  while also leading to increases in employment in other industries due  to improved competitiveness, productivity, and profitability);  it is too soon to observe the employment effects of automation (e.g.,  growth in tech jobs in an industry may be a leading indicator of  employment disruption); or our analysis covered a period of overall economic growth, which could  obscure or overwhelm other employment trends.
For example, according to our analysis  of 2016 ACS data, workers with lower levels of education are more likely  than those with higher levels to hold jobs in occupations that the Frey and  Osborne study identify as susceptible to automation.
Specifically, Census plans to include new questions that ask firms  about: (1) their use of advanced technologies such as AI, cloud  computing, robotics, and specialized software and equipment; (2) their  motivation for adopting and using artificial intelligence and advanced  technologies; (3) the impact these technologies might have on the  number and skill level of workers; and (4) the factors that could adversely  affect the adoption or production of these technologies.
DOL collects workforce data through  various surveys, including the Current Population Survey’s Displaced  Worker Supplement, and produces other data products such as the  occupational employment projections and Occupational Information  Network database that include information related to advanced  technologies.
Commerce and DOL Face  Challenges Tracking the  Workforce Effects of  Advanced Technologies Officials at Commerce and DOL stated that collecting data on the  adoption and workforce effects of advanced technologies is challenging  because it is difficult to identify which new and emerging technologies to  track; employment trends generally occur at the occupation and industry  levels but the effects of advanced technologies typically occur at the task  or job level; and employment trends have a complex and diverse set of  causes.
Officials at one small manufacturer we visited said that a collaborative robot was well  suited for the firm’s production process and environment because, among other reasons:  (1) the firm produces small durable goods that require dexterity rather than speed, which  the collaborative robot could provide; (2) the collaborative robot would be safe around  workers and could be trained by non-technical staff, so the firm’s small workforce could  adapt to its use; and (3) the collaborative robot could fit in the firm’s limited floor space,  as it would not require a cage.
Similarly, according to firm officials at a different medium-sized automotive parts  manufacturer, revenue has grown six times in the past 15 years while the workforce has  grown four times, largely as a result of adopting robotics technology.
Redeployments with job loss through attrition: Officials at some of the  selected firms that redeployed workers said they also reduced their  overall workforce size through attrition, as a result of adopting advanced  technologies."
448,"However, our analyses  also determined that for fiscal years 2004 through 2018, female enlisted  servicemembers and commissioned officers had higher attrition rates  than their male counterparts, and the percentage of female active-duty  servicemembers began to decrease at the 10–to-less-than-20-years of  service career point, meaning a smaller pool of female servicemembers  being available for leadership opportunities.
When controlling for various individual and occupational characteristics— including pay grade categories, marital status, race or ethnicity, education  level, occupation, and whether the servicemember has dependents— among others—female active-duty servicemembers’ average estimated  likelihood of separating from the military per quarter year of time in  service ranges from 1.8 percent to 3.1 percent, depending on their branch  of service, while that for their male counterparts ranges from 1.4 percent  to 2.3 percent, if other personal characteristics remain the same.
Additionally, OSD officials stated that, in 2017,  ODEI conducted an assessment of diversity and inclusion among officers  that analyzed fiscal year 2012 through 2016 data to determine whether  there was a difference between male and female retention within each of  the services.
Our  analysis of these data found that the reasons active-duty servicemembers  separate from the military vary slightly based on gender, pay grade  category, and length of service, as well as by time period.
Through our review, we  identified six factors that were reported to influence female active-duty  servicemembers’ separation from the military: work schedules,  deployments, organizational culture, family planning, sexual assault, and  dependent care.
Specifically:  The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness provides guidance to the services,  for example, in its forthcoming diversity and inclusion strategic plan, to  develop plans, with clearly defined goals, performance measures, and  timeframes, to guide and monitor recruitment and retention efforts of  female active-duty servicemembers in the military."
449,"While a PLSF application is not explicitly required by statute for a  borrower to be considered for TEPSLF loan forgiveness, Education  officials said that the department added this step to the process because  the PSLF application form captures information the TEPSLF loan servicer  needs to determine a borrower’s eligibility for TEPSLF.
Officials from Education, the TEPSLF loan servicer, and representatives  from selected organizations representing student borrowers all said that  the requirement to submit a PSLF application to be eligible for TEPSLF  loan forgiveness can confuse borrowers.
(Recommendation 1) The Chief Operating Officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid  should provide certain borrowers, for example, those who are denied  TEPSLF for not having 120 qualifying payments, with more  information about options available to contest TEPSLF decisions on  the TEPSLF website and in their denial letters."
450,"Potential Effects on  Consumers Are  Included in DOT’s  Assessment of  Applications for  Antitrust Immunity DOT analyzes competitive and public benefit effects, taking into  consideration the potential effects on consumers, when deciding whether  to approve cooperation agreements and grant carriers antitrust immunity,  based on our review of DOT’s processes.
In competitive and public  benefit analyses, DOT uses the professional experience and expertise of  staff to identify and assess relevant market factors, the terms of proposed  cooperative agreements, supporting documents, and other information  in light of the facts and circumstances specific to each case.
Our review of all the  proceedings found that each DOT order providing a grant of immunity  included discussion of DOT’s findings from its competitive and public  benefits analyses, as well as discussion of why and how DOT arrived at  stipulated remedies, if any.
DOT Does Not Report on  Monitoring Activities or on  Whether Immunities Have  Produced Anticipated  Benefits There is generally little, if any, information from DOT available to external  stakeholders and the public regarding DOT’s monitoring efforts and its  findings on the effects of granted antitrust immunities.
More specifically, DOT stated it will provide additional  public information about the status of its monitoring activities and  remedies, but it did not agree to report publicly on its findings about  whether grants of immunity have achieved anticipated benefits."
451,"Several federal agencies have a role in assessing the public health and  environmental effects from exposure to hazardous chemicals, although  these efforts may not be specifically related to underground natural gas  storage as described in this report.
Since November  2017, PHMSA Has  Not Fully Evaluated  Its Workforce Needs  for the Program or  Established  Performance Goals  That Reflect Efforts to  Improve Safety After our report in November 2017, PHMSA began inspecting natural gas  storage sites but has not fully assessed resource needs for its changing  workload or established a performance goal that measures PHMSA’s  progress toward its relevant strategic goal to improve safety.
First,  because PHMSA has not used an analysis of its workforce needs to  inform its budget requests, the agency may not have assurance that it  has enough resources to meet its performance goal of inspecting all of  the approximately 400 natural gas storage sites within 5 years (from early  2018 through early 2023).
Since 2017, PHMSA Has  Established and Worked  toward an Inspection  Performance Goal but Has  Not Used a Workforce  Analysis to Guide Its  Resource Decisions In November 2017, we reported that PHMSA had established a strategic  goal for its natural gas storage program but had not yet set performance  goals that define the level of performance officials hope to achieve or that  address all core program activities, such as conducting effective  inspections.
In 2018, PHMSA officials told us that the agency had established a  performance goal to inspect all of the approximately 400 natural gas  storage sites over 5 years (from early 2018 through early 2023), with the  expectation that state partners would help PHMSA inspect the sites.
However, in October 2018, PHMSA officials told us  that their inspectors would need more time than previously estimated to  complete each natural gas storage site inspection, due to requirements  for operators in the 2016 minimum safety standards."
452,"In addition to making changes to the standard lavatories, since 2015, both  Airbus and Boeing offered lavatory configurations for their single-aisle  aircraft designed to provide greater access for passengers who rely on  the use of onboard wheelchairs.
Overall,  about 4.5 percent of the combined single-aisle fleet of the eight selected  carriers have lavatories designed to provide some measure of greater  access to passengers with reduced mobility, including those who require  the use of the onboard wheelchair (see fig.4)."
453,"Following the enactment of the Federal Housing Enterprises  Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, the enterprises have been  required to meet specific goals for the purchase of mortgages supporting  underserved groups (such as low- and moderate-income families) or  certain geographic areas.
The recommendations propose  privatizing the enterprises, allowing new private entities to enter the  market, and providing an explicit federal guarantee on MBS that could  only be accessed in limited, exigent circumstances.
However, the federal  government has continued to support the housing market with guarantees  on more than two-thirds of new mortgages each year since 2008, either  through government-insured originations or by guaranteeing timely  payment to investors on mortgage loans purchased and securitized by  the enterprises.
But recent trends—some  loosening of underwriting standards, the rise of nonbank mortgage  lenders and servicers, and less access to affordable housing and  homeownership—may pose additional risks and challenges to the  housing market and participants, including the enterprises.
In response to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve provided  additional support for the mortgage market, becoming one of the largest  purchasers of MBS issued by the enterprises and guaranteed by Ginnie  Mae. Among other impacts, this action made these securities somewhat  more attractive to secondary market participants.
While FHFA and HUD officials told us nonbanks have helped provide  access to mortgage credit, several stakeholders and experts in all four of  our panels identified the increased presence of nonbank lenders as a  current risk in the housing finance system.
(We discuss recent proposals to  reform the housing finance system in detail later in this report.) FHFA Has Taken  Actions to Reduce the  Enterprises’  Exposure, but Risks,  Uncertainty, and  Challenges Remain  FHFA Has Taken Actions  to Reduce the Enterprises’  Risk Exposure FHFA-directed actions (including retained mortgage portfolio reductions,  credit risk transfer, and foreclosure prevention) have improved the  condition of the enterprises by mitigating some of the enterprises’  exposures to potential losses.
Additionally, the dominant role of the federal government in guaranteeing  MBS since the crisis has continued, and private capital generally has not  been positioned to absorb losses in the secondary mortgage market  during a potential economic downturn.
For example, in one  proposal we reviewed, lenders would sell loans meeting certain  requirements (such as qualified mortgages) to the corporation, which  would operate the common securitization platform to issue MBS with a federal guarantee.
Proposals Generally Meet  Some Key Reform  Elements The 14 proposals we reviewed generally meet the following elements of  our housing finance reform framework: recognizing and controlling federal  fiscal exposure, protecting mortgage investors, adhering to an appropriate  regulatory framework with government entities that have the capacity to  manage risks, emphasizing the implications of the transition to a new  housing finance system, protecting mortgage borrowers and addressing  market barriers, and considering market cyclicality and impacts on  financial stability."
454,"These present value estimates could be  included in a broader definition of economic resources or wealth, and we were able  to produce estimates of these additional retirement resources to supplement our  analysis of the distribution of income and wealth among older Americans over time.
While all estimates produced using survey data are subject to some uncertainty,  our present value estimates for these additional retirement resources are also  subject to additional uncertainty that arises from using another data source—the  Financial Accounts of the United States—to create a measure of aggregate defined  benefit entitlements; having limited information about lifetime earnings in the  Survey of Consumer Finances; and making assumptions about life expectancy,  real discount rates, and retirement ages, which are unlikely to hold for all  households.
Data limitations prevented us from producing this broader measure of  retirement resources for our analysis examining the distributions of income and  wealth as a cohort of older Americans aged.
See appendix I for more information on our definitions and the methods used to  produce estimates of wealth, the present value of future income expected from Social  Security and defined benefit plans, and income.
While the households  included in the SCF are different for each year of data we used in our  analysis, we were able to examine how the distribution of income and  wealth across older households changed over time.
On the other hand, for the top two quintiles, wealth was the  most important retirement resource, as households in the top quintile  have wealth that, on average, far exceeds the estimated present value of  benefits provided by any future Social Security or pension benefits.
When looking at a broader definition of  retirement resources (assets plus the present value of future income  from Social Security and DB pensions), we estimated that the top  quintile had, on average, about $4.3 million in these resources, about  8 times as much as the bottom quintile, which had, on average, about  $535,000.
Income and Wealth Disparities  by Demographic  Characteristics Income and wealth were consistently lower over time for older  households headed by someone who was a racial minority,  single, or  hadn’t attended college, according to our analysis of 1989 through 2016  SCF data.
Overall, an estimated 63 percent of the individuals in our sample were  alive in 2014 (ages 73 to 83), and greater levels of income and wealth  were associated with greater longevity in our analysis of HRS data.
We estimated that individuals whose households were in the top two  quintiles (top 40 percent) of the mid-career earnings distribution were  more likely than their counterparts in the bottom 60 percent to be alive in  2014 (ages 73 to 83) in an analysis controlling for race and ethnicity,  gender, age, education level, and initial self-reported health status on  entry into HRS in 1992.
Analyzing Income and Wealth for Households Over Time  We analyzed Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data to estimate how income and  wealth distributions changed as a particular cohort of older Americans aged over time.
Households in the top 20 percent of mid-career earnings had greater  participation in retirement accounts (see sidebar) and increased home  equity relative to other households, which may have contributed to wealth  disparities over the time period of our analysis.
We generally followed methods presented in an 2016  paper entitled “Is the U.S. Retirement System Contributing to Rising  Wealth Inequality?” by Devlin-Foltz, Henriques, and Sabelhaus (see  bibliography for the full citation), but made some changes in the  assumptions given our specific focus on older Americans.
A general limitation of our analysis of the present value of future income  from DB pensions and Social Security is that our estimates rely on  assumptions about life expectancy, real discount rates, and retirement  ages, which are unlikely to hold for all households."
455,"DOD Reported It  Primarily Considered  Strategic  Relationships   and FFRDC Core  Competencies   When Sponsoring  S&A Centers and  Initiating Projects Sponsoring agreements note and primary sponsors reported in  comprehensive reviews that S&A Centers are utilized because of DOD’s  strategic relationships with FFRDCs. As described in the FAR, FFRDCs  meet special, long-term research or development needs of the sponsoring  agencies.
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment  (OUSD(A&S)) officials told us that S&A Centers are oftentimes chosen to  perform work for DOD due to unique long-term strategic relationships with  sponsors for independent and knowledgeable expertise within core  competencies to address sponsors’ specific analytic requirements.
Navy primary sponsor officials identified the long-term relationship  between CNA, the FFRDC, and the Navy, which has led to broad  subject-matter expertise in naval matters, as a reason they used CNA  for the fiscal year 2016 study on the assessment of the effects of  possible policy changes to a career track program for military officers  trained to work with other military services."
456,"Table 1 provides a summary of the program costs identified for VistA by  OIT and VHA for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that we determined to be  reliable.
Instead, the  department provided estimations of the amount of salaries paid to OIT  government staff working on activities such as VistA Evolution,  program management, and overall support of VistA and related  applications.
Data standardization and testing – OIT officials stated that  additional costs related to work on clinical terminology mapping and  functional testing were not included in the total costs for VistA for  fiscal years 2015 through 2017."
457,"Agencies can use programmatic  agreements to satisfy their Section 106 responsibilities in the following  circumstances: when effects on historic properties are similar and repetitive or are  multi-state or regional in scope, when effects on historic properties cannot be fully determined prior to  approval of a project, when nonfederal parties are delegated major decision-making where routine management activities are undertaken at federal  installations, facilities, or other land-management units, or when other circumstances warrant a departure from the normal  Section 106 process.
Preserve America also instructed executive branch departments and  agencies to assess the current status of their historic property inventories  (including general condition and management needs) and directs  agencies with real property management responsibilities to report on  efforts to identify, protect, and use historic properties every 3 years.
Military department officials told us that when a lease or programmatic  agreement is signed with a private developer, the responsibility to identify  and evaluate homes for historic significance is generally transferred to the  private developer.
For both objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, executive  orders, and DOD (including military service) guidance that govern efforts  to identify, evaluate, manage, and maintain DOD’s historic properties.
To determine the extent to which DOD assesses the condition of its  historic properties and has guidance on the training of installation  personnel maintaining and working in historic properties, we conducted interviews with officials from within OSD, each military department and  officials at the 10 installations we visited to identify efforts to manage and  maintain historic properties."
458,"Data Used in Our Analysis We analyzed 2001–2017 data from the American Community Survey and  American Housing Survey to describe renter household characteristics,  rent affordability, rental housing conditions, and trends at the national  level and across different types of localities.
However, we determined that additional, nonpublic data  were needed from each survey to analyze renter household  characteristics, rent burden, and rental housing conditions for smaller  geographic units.
We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of analyzing renter household  characteristics, rent burden, and rental housing conditions from 2001  through 2017 at the national level and for different types of localities.
The groupings provide a  general framework for describing metro areas that experienced varying  degrees of population growth from 2000 through 2017 and how trends in  renter household characteristics, rent affordability, and rental housing  conditions compared to trends in other types of areas.
Rent Affordability To describe trends in the affordability of rental housing, we analyzed  American Community Survey data on gross rent as a percentage of  household income from 2001 through 2017 at the national level and  across different types of localities."
459,"These data, however, may not fully  account for the number of nonfederal NPL sites that may be in such areas  because (1) federal data are generally based on current or past  conditions; (2) data are not available for some areas; and (3) the NCA  has reported that climate change may exacerbate flooding, storm surge,  and wildfires in certain regions of the United States.
Further, according to the NCA, EPA documents, and interviews with EPA  officials, there may be other climate change effects that could impact  nonfederal NPL sites, such as potential increases in salt water intrusion  (the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers), drought,  precipitation, hurricane winds, and average and extreme temperatures;  we did not analyze these effects because we did not identify relevant  national-level federal data sets.
EPA provides training and direction to remedial project managers—the  lead EPA officials at nonfederal NPL sites—on conducting site-level risk  assessments that incorporate information on potential impacts of climate  change effects.
However, without  providing direction to remedial project managers on how to integrate  information on the potential impacts of climate change effects into site- level risk assessments at nonfederal NPL sites across all regions and  types of remedies, EPA cannot ensure that remedies will protect human  health and the environment in the long term.
In two national  studies EPA conducted in 2012 and 2017, EPA examined potential  impacts of some climate change effects on selected remedies at NPL  sites, including nonfederal NPL sites, and generally found that it has  taken actions to respond to risks through its existing cleanup processes.
However, without providing  direction for remedial project managers on how to integrate information  on potential impacts of climate change effects into site-level risk response  decision making at nonfederal NPL sites, EPA cannot ensure that  remedies will protect human health and the environment in the long term.
Technical Challenges EPA faces technical challenges in managing risks to human health and  the environment from the potential impacts of climate change effects in  terms of available expertise and data, according to documents we  reviewed and EPA regional officials we interviewed.
(Recommendation 1) The Administrator of EPA should clarify how EPA’s actions to manage  risks to human health and the environment from the potential impacts  of climate change effects at nonfederal NPL sites align with the  agency’s current goals and objectives."
460,"DOD officials explained  that, after acquisition reform in the late 1990s, the department shifted  much of the responsibility for reliability issues to contractors, and  government personnel primarily focused on how systems performed  during operational tests at the end of their development program.
We identified the following key practices in  the commercial sector:  leveraging reliability engineers early and often, establishing realistic reliability requirements—for example, not  expecting a product to operate twice as long as its predecessor before  failing, emphasizing reliability with their suppliers, and employing reliability engineering activities to improve a system’s  design throughout development.
We recommend the Secretary of the Air Force issue policy emphasizing  the following three key reliability practices when planning and executing  acquisition programs:  leveraging reliability engineers early and often, establishing realistic reliability requirements, and employing reliability engineering activities to improve a system’s  design throughout development.
(Recommendation 2) We recommend the Secretary of the Navy issue policy emphasizing the  following three key reliability practices when planning and executing  acquisition programs:  leveraging reliability engineers early and often, establishing realistic reliability requirements, and employing reliability engineering activities to improve a system’s  design throughout development."
461,"AAA found that AMRG did not sufficiently evaluate the performance of its  primary contractor and recommended that AMRG require that all program  managers receive contracting officer’s representative training and ensure  that individual quality assurance surveillance plans are developed for  each task order over $150,000.
AAA found  that AMRG had not effectively negotiated prices for its primary marketing  and advertising contract; AAA recommended that AMRG (1) define and  implement a well-structured policy for conducting technical evaluations of  contractor proposals and (2) establish a standardized form to ensure  consistency during the evaluation process.
Based on our analysis of the Army’s actions, the Army’s steps to  implement AAA’s recommendations fall into the following five areas: (1)  revising strategic goals, (2) updating and documenting its assessment  process, (3) improving the reliability and capabilities of data systems, (4)  integrating national and local marketing and advertising efforts, and (5)  obtaining new tools to determine required marketing and advertising  resources.
As the Army takes  additional steps to establish the newly-formed AEMO, it will be important  for the Army to continue to align its efforts with these commercial best  practices for assessing the effectiveness of advertising to ensure  advertising dollars are used efficiently to help meet stated recruiting  goals."
462,"In addition, according to FITARA, the Office of Electronic Government at  OMB was to: Establish metrics applicable to the consolidation and optimization of  data centers (including server efficiency), ensure that agencies’  progress toward meeting government-wide data center consolidation  and optimization metrics is made publicly available, review agencies’  inventories and strategies to determine whether they are  comprehensive and complete, and monitor the implementation of  each agency’s strategy.
Further, the memorandum stated that OMB was to maintain a public  dashboard (referred to as the IT Dashboard) to display government-wide  and agency-specific progress in areas such as planned and achieved  data center closures, consolidation-related cost savings, and data center  optimization performance information.
OMB’s guidance further noted that agency progress against these  performance metrics was to be measured by OMB on a quarterly basis,  using agencies’ data center inventory submissions and OMB-defined  closures, cost savings, and optimization targets.
According to the draft, OMB also plans to work with agencies to  set agency-specific goals for data center closures and cost savings and to  update these targets from those set in OMB’s August 2016 memorandum  to match agencies’ current status and progress.
Of the 23 agencies that had submitted their strategic  plans at the time of our review, 7 agencies—Agriculture, the Department  of Education (Education), DHS, and the Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD); GSA; the National Science Foundation  (NSF); and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)—had addressed  all five required elements of a strategic plan, as identified by OMB (such  as providing information related to data center closures and cost savings  metrics).
In a subsequent report that we issued in August 2017, we noted that 22 of  the 24 agencies required to participate in the OMB DCOI had reported  (collectively) limited progress against OMB’s fiscal year 2018  performance targets for the five optimization metrics.
We also recommended that the 18 agencies  that did not have fully documented plans take action, within existing OMB  reporting mechanisms, to complete plans describing how they intended to  achieve OMB’s requirement to implement automated monitoring tools at  all agency-owned data centers by the end of fiscal year 2018.
Because GAO had made a number of recommendations to OMB and the  24 DCOI agencies to help improve the reporting of data center-related  cost savings and to achieve optimization targets, we did not make new  recommendations and noted that, as of March 2018, 74 of the 81 prior  recommendations had not been fully addressed.
Agencies Reported  Mixed Results in  Efforts and Plans to  Meet OMB’s Targets  for Data Center  Closures and Cost  Savings According to OMB guidance, agencies were expected to close at least 25  percent of tiered data centers government-wide, by the end of fiscal  year 2018.
As of August 2018, most (22 of the 24) DCOI agencies continued to  report limited progress in meeting OMB’s fiscal year 2018 data center  optimization targets identified on the IT Dashboard."

Review of GAO  Documents We reviewed GAO documents, including: Designing Evaluations (GAO-12-208G)  select GAO products utilizing policy analysis approaches to identify  and assess policy options  We reviewed and analyzed 14 GAO TAs, including their designs and  considerations, using a data collection instrument that contained fields  regarding each report’s purpose, methodologies, and key considerations  for each methodology used (such as strengths and weaknesses).
Of the 56 GAO reports, 12 were selected for review based on  the following criteria: (1) the reports were publicly released after January  1, 2013 and (2) the reports included identification and assessment of  policy options (not solely a presentation of agency actions related to  policy options or general policy considerations).
Review of Select  Congressional  Research Service  Reports We identified a pool of 29 Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports  to consider reviewing that were technology assessments or included an  analysis of policy options, based on a keyword search of CRS’s website."
464,"Varied State Eligibility  Criteria and  Challenges  Identifying and  Evaluating Children  May Help Explain  Differences in  Percentages Served Eligibility Criteria and  Identification Processes  Vary Across States IDEA requires states to have policies and procedures to ensure that  school districts identify, locate, and evaluate all children suspected of  having a disability who need special education and related services,  regardless of the severity of their disability, but also gives states some  latitude in establishing eligibility criteria and defining disability categories.
Officials in one of the  states said that sharing data could allow them to identify children  being provided school-aged special education services that had not  received Early Intervention services.
However, officials we  interviewed at state agencies in the four states we visited— Massachusetts, Colorado, New York, and Iowa—said that because of  challenges in identifying and evaluating children, some infants and  toddlers who are eligible and would benefit from Early Intervention  services do not receive them.
Officials from lead  agencies in Massachusetts, Colorado, New York, and regional education  officials in Iowa, noted that it was difficult to find enough Early  Intervention personnel with appropriate expertise in low population  density areas which can complicate the process of identifying and  evaluating children.
School district officials in the  four states we visited said that they identify a significant number of their  districts’ school-aged special education students through referrals from  the state’s Early Intervention programs during the transition process."
465,"Coast Guard Applied  Some Key Practices  when Reorganizing  its Deployable  Specialized Forces,  but Has Not Fully  Analyzed Workforce  Needs or Operational  Capabilities The Coast Guard generally applied three of five key practices for agency  reform and partially applied two of five when developing its report that  recommended the 2013 reorganization of its Specialized Forces units.
Coast Guard Has Not  Fully Used Data to Assess  Workforce Needs or  Evaluated Potential  Overlap or Gaps in the  Capabilities of its  Deployable Specialized  Forces  Use Data and Evidence to  Assess Workforce Needs Coast Guard partially applied two of five key practices for agency  reorganization, including using data and evidence, and considering to  some extent the possibility of fragmentation, duplication, and overlap.
Until the Coast Guard comprehensively assesses  Specialized Forces’ needs, the Coast Guard will lack a complete picture  of the extent to which overlapping capabilities are necessary or  appropriate, or where there are capability gaps or areas where certain  Specialized Forces units could be better leveraged to meet mission  requirements."
466,"This may include identifying duplicate comments  (those with identical or near-identical comment text, but unique  identity information), posting comments to the agency’s public  website, and distributing comments to agency subject-matter experts  within responsible program offices for analysis.
Similarly, in its response to comments document for a 2016 rule, for  example, BLM responded directly to the themes and issues raised by  comments while stating that the issue was raised by “one commenter” or  “some commenters.” Selected Agencies’  Practices Associated  with Posting Identity  Information Are Not  Clearly  Communicated to  Public Users of  Comment Websites The 10 selected agencies have implemented varied ways of posting  identity information during the comment intake process, particularly  regarding posting duplicate comments, as allowed by the APA.
Selected Agencies’  Practices Associated with  Posting Identity  Information on  Regulations.gov Vary and  Are Not Clearly  Communicated to Public  Users Public users of Regulations.gov seeking to submit a comment are  provided with a blanket disclosure statement related to how their identity  information may be disclosed, and are generally directed to individual  agency websites for additional detail about submitting comments.
We found that when Regulations.gov provides public users with additional  agency-specific information about the comment intake process, including  accepting and posting comments, it is typically provided in the context of  the comment form and does not provide public users enough detail to  determine what comment data will be available for use when searching  comments that are already submitted.
As a result, Regulations.gov directs public users to participating  agencies’ websites for additional information about agency-specific  review and posting policies.
Further, even when selected participating agencies  include details on their website about the agency’s posting practices or  treatment of identity information associated with public comments, it does  not fully describe data limitations that public users need to make informed  decisions about how to use the data provided.
FWS: One NPRM-specific web page that we identified communicated  to public users that all comments will be posted on Regulations.gov,  including any personal information provided through the process."
467,"Specifically, of the 16 school districts we visited in  six states, officials in 12 districts said they had recently conducted a  facilities condition assessment for a variety of reasons, such as to  develop facilities master plans or raise support for a bond.
Officials in  Michigan said their state provides no funding for school facilities nor  requires districts to conduct facilities condition assessments because  districts are responsible for planning and prioritizing school facilities’  needs.
School Districts  Prioritized Safety and  Technology Updates  and Primarily Used  Local Funding for  School Facilities School Districts Prioritized  Safety and Technology  while Also Addressing  Repairs and  Modernization Projects In addition to key building systems such as HVAC, lighting, and roofing,  school districts considered the need to ensure schools are free from  health hazards, as well as update schools with modern educational  spaces and features.
Specifically, based on our survey, we estimate that  school districts’ high priorities when updating or renovating school  facilities are as follows: security (estimated 92 percent), student access to  technology (87 percent), monitoring hazards to student and staff health  (78 percent), and improving telecommunication features such as wireless  internet (74 percent).
In school districts we visited that reported having local taxes or bond  funds available for facility projects, officials described both the need to  address the condition of basic building systems and the need to renovate  schools with modern educational spaces and features.
State Support for School  Facilities Varied Within  and Across States Though school districts most commonly used local funding to address  school facility needs, 36 states provided some level of capital funding to  school districts for school construction or renovations, based on our state  survey (see fig.
Based on our school district survey, 51 of 66 districts that received Impact  Aid had conducted a facilities condition assessment of their schools at  least once in the last 10 years.
None of the officials we interviewed in the eight districts that received  Impact Aid said their district used Basic Support payments to address  issues with the conditions of school facilities."
468,"Figure 3  illustrates examples of resources used by Border Patrol and AMO, which  include the following:  surveillance technology, such as Remote Video Surveillance  Systems—systems of towers with cameras that transmit information  to video monitors at a Border Patrol facility—and unattended ground  sensors—remotely monitored sensors placed in or on the ground, or  on ground-based platforms, to detect, track, identify, and differentiate  humans, animals, and vehicles—used by Border Patrol agents to  detect and identify illicit cross-border activity;  radar systems to detect and identify aircraft and vessel incursions;  IT and communication systems to conduct operations and ensure the  safety and security of agents while on duty, including databases and  systems for processing detainees, infrastructure to operate  surveillance technology, and tactical communication equipment such  as land mobile radios; aircraft, including fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, vehicles, including all- terrain vehicles and snowmobiles, and large and small vessels;  tactical infrastructure, including fencing, roads, and border markers  and signs; and  facilities, including buildings to house workstations and offices for  agents and civilian personnel, short-term detention facilities to  process and hold individuals arrested by Border Patrol agents,  forward operating bases in remote locations to support Border Patrol  agent operations, and hangars for aircraft and vessel storage and  repair.
Border Patrol, in its fiscal year 2018 intelligence reports for its eight  northern border sectors, also identified alien smuggling—bringing into, or  harboring or transporting within, the United States, foreign nationals in  violation of U.S. immigration law—organizations operating along the  northern border between ports of entry as a threat.
CBP Identified Resource  Challenges Affecting  Northern Border Security  and Actions to Address  Them  Air and Maritime Radar Officials from Border Patrol sectors and AMO branches stated that there  are gaps in air radar coverage along the northern border, limiting their  ability to detect and identify aircraft incursions.
According to Border Patrol officials responsible for developing  and implementing performance measures, Border Patrol’s priority is to  develop measures to assess the effectiveness of its efforts to secure the  southwest border, such as the effort to achieve complete operational  control as outlined in the Executive Order 13767 instructions and the  fiscal year 2018 DHS agency priority goal.
Additionally, in 2012 we recommended that Border Patrol establish  milestones and time frames for developing performance measures to  support implementation of its 2012-2016 Strategic Plan, including  assessing progress made in securing the northern border between ports  of entry and informing resource identification and allocation efforts.
AMO officials stated that they have not implemented performance  measures to assess AMO’s effectiveness at securing the northern border  between ports of entry in the air and maritime environments because of  difficulties in creating region-specific performance targets."
469,"The Public Assistance  Alternative Procedures  Program in Puerto Rico  and the USVI The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 authorized the use of  alternative procedures in administering the Public Assistance program,  thereby providing new flexibilities to FEMA, states, territories, and local  governments for debris removal, infrastructure repair, and rebuilding  projects using funds from this program.
In October 2017, Puerto Rico requested, and FEMA approved, the use of  the alternative procedures program for all large-project funding for Public  Assistance permanent work projects in categories C through G.
The majority of FEMA’s  obligations and the funding Puerto Rico expended as of April 2019 are for  emergency work because these projects began soon after the disasters  struck and focused on debris removal and providing assistance to  address immediate threats to life and property.
In particular, our prior and ongoing work have  identified challenges related to (1) the clarity of FEMA’s guidance for the  Public Assistance program, (2) the time and resources needed to  transition to FEMA’s new Public Assistance program delivery model in  Puerto Rico, (3) the implementation of flexibilities provided by the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and (4) developing fixed-cost estimates."
470,"Statistical Outliers Officials from South Carolina’s state Medicaid agency and two MCOs  from Pennsylvania and Washington said they identified high-expenditure  beneficiaries by examining service utilization data to identify statistical  outliers or trends.
South Dakota implemented a health home program in 2013, which  paid local primary care clinics, community mental health centers, and  Indian Health Service facilities to provide care management to high- expenditure Medicaid beneficiaries.
Officials with one state Medicaid agency’s health home  program said there was a shortage of individuals in rural areas willing  to provide care management to high-expenditure beneficiaries."
471,"For example: An official from one clinic said that new staff needed to be trained  prior to opening day, so it is not uncommon for staff to be hired and  brought on-board before the facility begins providing clinical services.
Activations Office officials also said that the template is typically  completed by facility activation staff and includes inputs such as planned  clinical services as well as estimated staffing, equipment, and supply  costs.
(Recommendation 1) The Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Administrative  Operations should develop and document a process for comparing  actual activation costs for major medical facility projects to estimates."
472,"Working with stakeholders to understand what, if  any, additional transit-specific workforce data transit stakeholders need  and the related collection costs could enable FTA to weigh the complete  costs and benefits of developing future data for the transit industry and to  make informed decisions on allocating the appropriate resources toward  those efforts.
Examples of actions they have taken to  address workforce needs, either with a transit workforce grant or with  other funding include: Career enhancement: Los Angeles County Metropolitan  Transportation Authority officials told us that they have developed a  program that offers growth opportunities by providing “upskilling”  resources at all levels of the agency including employee development,  management/leadership, and transportation senior leadership, among  other things.
However, more  specific strategic planning efforts that include developing a strategy and  performance goals and measures can better enable FTA to effectively  help transit agencies identify, prepare, and provide a sufficient workforce  for the future.
For all objectives, we analyzed key Department of Transportation (DOT)  and FTA documents such as DOT strategic plans, annual reports to  Congress in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, and public presentations, which  discussed workforce needs, grant programs, and data involving the transit  industry."
473,"For  example, some note that the E/M billing codes that primary care  physicians generally use to bill for their services were developed at a time  when care coordination and planning was not part of the standard  practice of medicine; as such, these codes do not reflect time spent on  activities that do not require a face-to-face encounter with the beneficiary,  including medical conferences with other physicians, or telephone calls to  coordinate care with other providers.
These concerns included the  following: Overlap with existing codes that require the development of care  plans: While not explicitly stating that existing codes were sufficient,  some stakeholders said that if a new billing code were created for the  LCCP service as defined in the 2018 BBA, it would overlap with or  duplicate existing billing codes.
Inability of non-physician staff to independently bill for care planning:  Seven stakeholders expressed concerns that non-physician staff such  as nurses and social workers cannot independently bill the existing  Medicare billing codes that we identified as being LCCP-type  services."
474,"Regulators Inform  Consumers about  Protections Available  and Consumers Can  Take Some Actions  after a CRA Data  Breach In our February 2019 report, we noted that FTC and CFPB provide  educational information for consumers on ways to mitigate the risk of  identity theft."
475,"Taxpayers may first realize they are victims of employment-related  identity fraud when IRS notifies them of discrepancies in the reporting of  income earned using their names and SSNs. After filing deadlines have  passed, IRS’s Nonfiler and Automated Underreporter (AUR) programs  use W-2 information to identify and follow up with taxpayers who appear  to owe taxes but either have not filed returns (Nonfiler) or have filed  returns but underreported earnings (AUR).
We previously reported that the existence of three or more wage records  in the same time frame for the same individual indicates possible SSN  misuse, which could include employment-related identity fraud.
IRS did not apply IDT-related indicators to  some of the accounts of deceased individuals we identified as having  employer-reported wages not included on a tax return.
Third, while our analysis shows that  employment-related identity fraud may be a more widespread problem  than the ITIN/SSN mismatch that IRS currently tracks, IRS officials told us  that other types of employment-related identity fraud would be identified  and addressed through processes the agency applies broadly to all  taxpayers, such as the AUR or Nonfiler programs.
IRS Has Not  Assessed  Opportunities to  Expand Detection  and Deterrence  Activities IRS’s Use of Nonfiler to  Detect and Deter  Employment-Related  Identity Fraud Is Limited IRS uses relevant information to detect inaccurate W-2s, including  potentially fraudulent W-2s, and makes this information available to  relevant enforcement programs, including Nonfiler, which IRS uses to  follow up with individuals who appear to owe taxes but have not filed.
In reviewing IRS actions that may help deter employment-related identity  fraud, we found that Nonfiler uses W-2 information to identify and follow  up with individuals who appear to owe taxes but did not file required  returns.
IRS  officials told us that IRS previously sent lock-in letters for cases involving  mismatched names and SSNs but stopped in 2012 because the agency  wanted to avoid potentially disclosing an employment-related identity  fraudster’s identifying information, such as the names of their employers,  to those individuals whose SSNs were used to commit employment fraud.
IRS officials acknowledged this possibility and told us the  agency has not assessed the potential costs and benefits of expanding  WHC to include cases with mismatched names and SSNs. Internal control standards state that federal managers should use quality  information to achieve their objectives, communicate relevant information  throughout the agency, and both assess and address risks to their  mission."
476,"Financial Literacy  Education Training Compared to the legacy retirement system, which provided only a DB  plan, the BRS’s enhanced DC benefit and reduced DB annuity shifts  more of the responsibility for managing servicemembers’ retirement  security from DOD to servicemembers.
GAO’s prior work on financial literacy training compiled  testimony from experts from the private sector, federal government  agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and academic institutions to: define financial literacy as the ability to use knowledge and skills to  manage financial resources effectively for a lifetime of well-being;  identify the workplace as a particularly effective venue for providing  financial education and helping individuals improve their financial  decision making; and  summarize the effectiveness of various interventions and how to  address the needs of workplace populations traditionally underserved  by financial education.
While DOD  developed the BRS trainings and conducted outreach, DOD officials said  that the service branches have the primary responsibility for developing  and providing servicemembers continuing financial literacy education,  including on saving for retirement, based on their own resources and their  servicemembers’ needs.
DOD  officials said the agency plans to improve the consistency of the  continuing financial literacy education provided by the service branches  and consolidate it so it is delivered at the career and life stages specified  by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016.
DOD officials  acknowledged that servicemembers may need more one-on-one help  when making personal financial decisions, which is why the agency  trained PFMs and PFCs to address servicemembers’ BRS and financial  literacy questions and provide additional support.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing (1)  what actions the Department of Defense (DOD) has taken to help  servicemembers understand the Blended Retirement System (BRS) and,  more generally, educate servicemembers on saving for retirement; (2)  what DOD can learn from financial literacy training effective practices and  the implementation of BRS training to continue supporting  servicemembers in saving for retirement; and (3) how lump-sum payment  amounts are determined under BRS and how they compare to the  methods used for private-sector pension plans that offer them."
477,"DHS Provides  Services to States  and Local Election  Jurisdictions, and  Selected Election  Officials Reported  Being Satisfied with  DHS’s Assistance DHS, through CISA, has taken steps to assist election officials in securing  election infrastructure by providing services in three areas: regional  support and assistance, education and awareness, and information  sharing and analysis among federal, state, and local organizations.
CISA also manages the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center (NCCIC), which receives reports of suspected  malicious cyber activity from state and local officials, analyzes attempts to  infiltrate election systems, and shares information about threats and  vulnerabilities through the EI-ISAC.
CISA has begun developing strategic and operations plans for assisting  states and local jurisdictions in securing election infrastructure in  preparation for the 2020 elections.
For example, it includes three objectives for the protecting  election infrastructure line of effort: building stakeholder capacity to manage risks and handle  adversaries, through activities such as creating incident response and  communication plans and encouraging states to adopt and practice  them; providing technology services to stakeholders to monitor and secure  their networks, by promoting the use of CISA’s voluntary services and  assessments, among other things; and  facilitating information sharing between the federal government,  private sector, and state and local partners by, among other things,  hosting situational awareness chat rooms prior to, during, and after  state and federal elections.
CISA Identified Challenges  Related to Its Efforts to  Secure Election  Infrastructure, but Has Not  Documented How It  Intends to Address Them DHS’s National Infrastructure Protection Plan, which provides strategic  direction for national, critical infrastructure protection efforts, calls for  sector-specific agencies to coordinate lessons learned and corrective  actions and rapidly incorporate them to improve future efforts."
478,"To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan  considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis  established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic  Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic  Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1.
The Corps Used  Economic Analyses in Its  Feasibility Studies to  Evaluate Project-Specific  Benefits and Costs and  Used Additional Analyses  to Evaluate Other Effects All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step  planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each  proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called  for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance.
In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the  Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary  project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we  reviewed.
The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we  reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the  recommended project plan alternatives."

482,"In contrast, in Puerto Rico,  the alternative procedures require that the central recovery office and  subrecipients work collaboratively with FEMA to develop a fixed cost  estimate.
The majority of FEMA’s obligations and the funding Puerto Rico  expended as of September 30, 2019, are for emergency work because  these projects began soon after the disasters struck and focused on  debris removal and providing assistance to address immediate threats to  life and property.
In  addition, FEMA and Puerto Rico officials have cited the large number of  sites requiring damage assessments, project development, and mutually  agreed-upon fixed cost estimates as a challenge.
We will continue to monitor the status of FEMA’s cost estimating process,  the development of the remaining fixed cost estimates for permanent  work and the impact of FEMA’s new guidance on the implementation of  section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act. FEMA Has Adapted  Cost Estimating  Guidance to Specific  Conditions in Puerto  Rico, but Could Take  Further Action to Fully  Align the Guidance  with Best Practices FEMA Has Adapted Its  Guidance to Estimate  Public Assistance Costs to  Address Post-Disaster  Conditions in Puerto Rico As Puerto Rico is responsible for any costs that exceed fixed cost  estimates for large infrastructure projects under the alternative  procedures, FEMA has adapted its guidance for estimating costs to  ensure that these estimates accurately reflect the total costs of Public  Assistance projects.
Officials from the  central recovery office and four Puerto Rico government agencies we  spoke with stated that they did not consistently have the guidance they  needed to implement the Public Assistance program.
According to FEMA officials, the agency works with Puerto Rico  government officials and subrecipients to provide relevant guidance and  technical assistance throughout the Public Assistance project  development process.
As the recipient for all Public  Assistance funding in Puerto Rico, the central recovery office is  responsible for monitoring and providing technical assistance to  subrecipients to ensure that federal funding is used in accordance with  federal statutes, regulations, and the requirements of the grant.
For example, according to the Puerto Rico  2019 Public Assistance Administrative Plan, the central recovery office is  responsible for, among other things, processing requests for time  extensions to complete projects and conducting quarterly reviews, site  inspections, and audits to ensure program compliance."
483,"For example,  under the plan, the teams conducting these initiatives were to have  established by June 2019 a common DOD process and metrics for  civilian hiring, prepared drafts of updated DOD policies and fiscal year  2020–2021 talent management guidance, and collected and mapped  different human resources service delivery models.
For the category management initiative, OCMO officials told us that  the first two quarterly “sprints”—reviews of different contracts or  categories of goods or services to identify savings—for fiscal year  2019 had been completed and the third was in progress, but did not  provide documentation to support this assertion."
484,"The March 2019 staff discussion paper (1) outlined a set of five guiding  principles that the Board would use to assess whether proposed CAS  changes are necessary and whether those changes would reduce the  burden on contractors while protecting the government’s interests, (2)  identified a roadmap that prioritized the Board’s proposed review of  standards, and 3) included a preliminary comparison of two standards to  GAAP.
Board members, as well as DCAA and DCMA officials, noted that  eliminating CAS requirements to rely purely on GAAP standards would  limit the government’s ability to compare contract proposals, assess  actual costs to avoid overcharges by contractors, and protect its interests.
In general, a business  segment is not subject to Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) until it  receives a non-exempt contract of $7.5 million or more from the federal  government."

486,"According to GSA, agencies’ responsibilities under  EIS include:  identifying key personnel, chiefly a Senior Transition Sponsor, Lead  Transition Manager, and Transition Ordering Contracting Officer; engaging expertise from Chief Information Officers, Chief Acquisition  Officers, and Chief Financial Officers to build an integrated transition  team of telecommunications managers, acquisition experts, and  financial staff; developing a financial strategy and budget for transition costs  beginning in fiscal year 2017; analyzing and confirming the accuracy of the inventory of active  services that must be transitioned; developing a transition plan that describes technological goals, a  transition schedule that includes GSA’s major transition milestones  (e.g., releasing all fair opportunity solicitations by March 31, 2019, and  issuing all task orders by September 30, 2019), a strategy for issuing  task orders on EIS for transitioning services, and any constraints or  risks; preparing solicitations for task orders; placing task and service orders;  coordinating resources to facilitate scheduling and communications  for implementing and maintaining services; and  reviewing, accepting or rejecting, and paying for services.
Officials from the 11 selected agencies that did not plan to finish their  transitions to EIS by GSA’s September 30, 2022, milestone—the  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, HHS, Homeland  Security, the Interior, Justice, Transportation, the Treasury, and VA; and  the Social Security Administration—reported that they planned to  complete the transitions before the current telecommunications contracts  are set to expire in May 2023.
In addition, Commerce officials stated in May 2019 that the majority of the  agency’s bureaus did not conduct cost-benefit analyses that considered  implementing new telecommunications technologies because Commerce  was planning to transition its services on a like-for-like basis in order to  complete the transition before May 2020, which was when the current  telecommunications contracts were previously set to expire.
Moreover,  while HHS officials stated that a staff member was providing human  capital management-related assistance to the agency’s centralized  EIS program management office, the agency had not documented this  role for the transition, nor defined specific responsibilities for this role.
(Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Commerce should ensure that the agency’s Chief  Information Officer completes efforts to identify future telecommunications  needs using a complete inventory of existing telecommunications  services; conducts and documents a comprehensive strategic analysis at  all bureaus to identify areas for optimization and sharing of  telecommunications resources; evaluates the costs and benefits of  implementing new telecommunications technology and alternative options  at all bureaus; and fully aligns Commerce’s telecommunications needs  with its long-term IT plans and enterprise architecture.
(Recommendation  2) The Secretary of Commerce should ensure that the agency’s Chief  Information Officer finalizes the responsibilities related to the information  security management role during the telecommunications transition, and  assigns the roles for providing legal expertise during the transition, as well  as for managing human capital, telecommunications assets, and  information security during the transition, to staff members; describes how  changes and disruptions related to the transition will be communicated to  end users at all bureaus and identifies the key local and regional agency  transition officials responsible for disseminating information about the  transition to employees and working with the vendor to facilitate transition  activities in Commerce’s transition communications plan; and establishes  and implements configuration and change management processes for its  transition.
(Recommendation 7) The Secretary of Health and Human Services should ensure that the  agency’s Chief Information Officer identifies and documents  telecommunications transition roles and responsibilities related to (1)  managing assets and human capital during the planning and execution  phases of the transition and (2) providing legal expertise during the  execution phase of the transition, and assigns the transition information  security management role to a staff member; and establishes and  implements configuration and change management processes for HHS’s  transition.
(Recommendation 11) The Secretary of State should ensure that the agency’s Chief Information  Officer completes efforts to identify the agency’s future  telecommunications needs using a complete inventory of existing  telecommunications services; conducts and documents a strategic  analysis to justify the sharing of telecommunications resources; and  aligns State’s telecommunications needs with its long-term IT plans and  enterprise architecture.
(Recommendation 17) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the agency’s Chief  Information Officer includes in its telecommunications transition  communications plan the key local and regional agency officials  responsible for disseminating information about the transition to  employees and working with the vendor to facilitate transition activities;  and establishes and uses cost and schedule management processes in  the agency’s transition."
487,"These  reports include information on the FMS transportation account balances,  and, in addition, DFAS provides supporting documentation that includes:  copies of bills paid from the accounts and detailed analysis of  individual transportation expenditures; an analysis of discrepancies DFAS identified for each transaction; and  financial transactions DFAS performed to reimburse the main  transportation account for specific BPC transportation expenditures,  through a process DOD refers to as realignment.
Both DSCA and DFAS officials said they use two pieces of information  from the reports and analyses: The transportation account code, which identifies the DOD  component responsible for a particular expenditure, and may provide  information on the country or program associated with the  transportation expenditure.
Because DFAS’s procedures do not include steps to identify all Navy and  Air Force transportation account codes, DFAS does not have reasonable  assurance that all expenditures are reviewed by DFAS for realignment  and provided to DSCA with the monthly report, which DSCA subsequently  uses to review the validity of expenditures.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director of DSCA  finalizes and implements internal guidance on how to conduct and  document DSCA’s monthly review of expenditures from the FMS  transportation accounts, including what information should be reviewed  and how to identify and follow up on discrepancies."
488,"The policy’s requirements related to research facilities’  consideration of alternatives include the following: Consistent with the act, NIH’s Public Health Service Policy directs  facilities to provide for NIH’s approval a document that describes their  vertebrate animal care and use program and that provides assurances  that the research institution meets applicable standards.
Other Relevant Legislation Other laws relevant to the consideration of alternatives include the  following: The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 directs the  Director of NIH to prepare a plan to conduct or support research into  methods of biomedical research and experimentation that do not require  the use of animals, that reduce the number of animals used in such  research, and that produce less pain and distress in such animals.
The steps HHS, USDA, and EPA take to help ensure that agency  researchers and the researchers that they fund or oversee meet the  requirement to consider alternatives include (1) calling for written  descriptions of researchers’ consideration of alternatives and (2)  prescribing or recommending that researchers use searches, such as of  databases of published scientific literature, to identify alternatives.
In addition, NIH’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare is responsible for  the general administration and coordination of the Public Health Service  Policy and provides specific guidance, instruction, and materials to  research facilities that receive funding from agencies covered by the act.
EPA and Agencies within  HHS and USDA Have  Issued Strategies,  Policies, and Guidance on  Alternative Research  Methods EPA has issued a strategic plan and FDA has issued a roadmap for the  use of methods that may reduce animal use in assessments of the safety  and efficacy of various products."
489,"ROs are to conduct the following SMS activities on the Coast Guard’s  behalf:  review SMS documents and conduct initial company and vessel  audits to verify compliance with the ISM Code and applicable national  and international requirements;  issue a Document of Compliance to the vessel operator and a Safety  Management Certificate for the vessel, which is valid for up to 5 years;  conduct annual SMS compliance audits of the vessel operator;  conduct an intermediate SMS compliance audit for the vessel at least  once during the 5-year period; and  conduct renewal SMS compliance audits of vessel operator and  vessel(s) prior to expiration of the 5-year certificate.
Such activities  include managing the commercial vessel inspection program, developing  related guidance, and overseeing SMS audits and related activities  performed by ROs. In addition to oversight provided by officials at Coast  Guard headquarters, marine inspectors within local Coast Guard field  units are also responsible for conducting vessel inspections, which  routinely include assessing SMS effectiveness for applicable vessels.
As noted previously, the ISM Code and corresponding U.S. regulations  and Coast Guard guidance allow vessel operators flexibility in how they  address SMS functional requirements, including the documentation of  potential shipboard emergencies and applicable response procedures in  their SMS plans."
490,"Secret Service Lacks a  Policy with a Documented  Process for Collecting  Complete and Appropriate  Training Data for the  Uniformed Division The PMP recommended, and Secret Service agreed, that Uniformed  Division officers—who provide protection at the White House—train for 10  percent of their work time.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following two recommendations to the Secret Service:  The Director of the Secret Service should develop and implement a plan  to ensure that special agents assigned to PPD and VPD reach annual  training targets given current and planned staffing levels.
However, related to the first recommendation—  develop and implement a plan to ensure that special agents assigned to  PPD and VPD reach annual training targets given current and planned  staffing levels— Secret Service also stated that after further  consideration, the agency no longer believes that the annual training  target for Presidential and Vice Presidential Protective Divisions should  be set at 25 percent of their work time.
Additional action(s) Secret Service plans to take: In its FY 2018–FY  2025 Human Capital Strategic Plan and FY 2018 – FY 2025 Training  Strategic Plan, the Secret Service stated that increasing staffing levels  would allow the agency more flexibility with how it schedules shifts and  advance assignments, thereby freeing up special agents’ and Uniformed  Division officers’ time for training.
According to the PMP, “The Secret Service must continue efforts to  develop a professionalized recruiting and hiring process that finds  talented individuals, evaluates candidates rigorously for the Presidential  Protective Division, and hires them quickly.” Status: Implemented; ongoing work may be required to ensure  recommendation is sustained.
Additional action(s) Secret Service plans to take: According to agency  officials, the Secret Service is currently revising the Uniformed Division  Merit Promotion Process and is implementing the Administrative,  Professional, and Technical Career Progression Plan.
In addition, according to Secret Service officials, special  agents assigned to PPD and VPD run biweekly drills and training  scenarios at the White House complex and at the Vice President’s  Residence, while Uniformed Division officers are briefed on emergency  actions and responsibilities at shift changes."
491,"Additionally, officials we interviewed at six VISNs told us that the models  have not accounted for recent workload growth their medical centers  were experiencing due to an increase in the number of veterans they  serve, the addition of new services, or changes in the medical centers’  reliance on community care.
For example, we found that 6 VISNs provided limited  explanations for their fiscal year 2019 MCAS adjustments, such as stating  that they had decided to reallocate funds among medical centers to  ensure “continuity of operations,” which is insufficient information to allow  VHA to determine if the adjustments were appropriate.
For example, officials from the Office of Patient  Care Services told us that to monitor the use of funds for prosthetics, they  conduct monthly reviews of obligations and ask the VISNs and medical  centers to explain deviations between the actual and planned  expenditures and provide an action plan.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following five recommendations to VHA: The VA Under Secretary of Health should use workload data from the  most recently completed fiscal year as part of the models that inform  VISNs’ and medical centers’ general purpose funding needs, when  doing so would not significantly delay the allocation of funds."

Dispute Resolution  Options Were Used  About 35,000 Times  Nationally and Use  Varied Across School  Districts with Different  Characteristics Due Process Complaints  Were the Most Commonly  Used Dispute Resolution  Option, and Disputes  Were Most Frequently  Related to Evaluations,  Placement, Services and  Supports, and Discipline For the 6.8 million students from ages 3 to 21 who were served under  IDEA Part B in school year 2016-17, there were a total of 35,142  mediation requests, due process complaints filed, and state complaints  filed nationwide.
According to state officials, Parent Training and Information Center (PTI)  staff, Protection and Advocacy (P&A) agency staff, and other  stakeholders we interviewed, parents most commonly engage in IDEA  dispute resolution because of concerns they have about the evaluations,  placement, services and supports, and discipline related to the  educational services their child receives.
We also interviewed various national organizations  that advocate for parents and local educational agencies (LEA) and  SEAs. To determine whether the use of dispute resolution options varied by  socioeconomic or racial and/or ethnic characteristics, we analyzed  dispute resolution data we collected at the LEA level from five states for  school year 2017-18, the most recent data available at the time of our  analysis."

496,"Our analysis  found that ICE did not satisfy the 2004 requirement for FOD approval in  18 of 87 (21 percent) cases that OPLA’s check box indicated involved  veterans who were placed into removal proceedings and ERO data  indicated had been removed from fiscal years 2013 through 2018.
ICE officials believe that these policies could be  updated with additional guidance to agents and officers to ask about and  document veteran status during interviews of potentially removable  individuals.
While tracking veteran status in the paper  alien file may allow ICE to review whether a specific individual is a  veteran, it does not provide the type of complete and accessible  electronic data that would allow the agency to systematically evaluate its  performance in adhering to its policies.
Maintaining complete electronic  data on veterans it encounters would assist ICE in determining the extent  to which the agency has adhered to its policies for handling cases  involving potentially removable veterans."
497,"Even without a loss-sharing  program, the federal government also faces implicit fiscal exposure  through a potential expectation to provide policyholders or insurers  assistance to address long-term effects after a terrorist event.
Since 2003, changes to TRIA  provisions have increased insurers’ share of losses and thus decreased  explicit federal fiscal exposure in the event of certified acts of terrorism  (see fig.
Currently, following a certified act of terrorism Treasury pays insurer  claims for 80 percent of insurers’ losses above their individual deductibles  once losses in a calendar year exceed the program trigger of $200 million  (see fig.
If a large terrorism act occurs in a year in which  the statute requires the collection of mandatory recoupment in a short  time frame, Treasury may need to set a high surcharge percentage on  premiums for policies with TRIA-eligible lines.
However, some insurers may not clearly understand whether Treasury  would include policyholder retention amounts in calculating losses to  certify a terrorist event, trigger loss sharing, or determine when the  program cap has been reached."

When NASA constructed its 2018 replan for the JWST project, it took into  account the remaining integration and test activities planned prior to  launch, known technology challenges that presented risks to schedule, as  well as potential future risks.
Little Margin for Error  Remains with  Challenging  Integration and Test  Work Ahead Though the JWST project has made significant progress since our last  report in March 2019, technical challenges have required the use of most  of the project’s available schedule reserve.

499,"For example, both government and  industry entities have research and testing of technologies underway to  provide UAS the capability to detect obstacles in midair, such as other  aircraft, and automatically maneuver to avoid collision; this capability is  commonly referred to as “detect and avoid.” FAA officials have stated that  this key capability is necessary before allowing certain UAS operations on  a routine basis, such as flights beyond the operator’s line of sight.
However, according to test site  representatives, staff at these sites facilitated more UAS flights during this  time frame than is reflected in the MLS data, because additional flights  were conducted using different allowances than COAs, such as under the  Part 107 rule that allows certain routine small UAS operations.
Test Sites Have Supported  UAS Stakeholders in  Conducting Research in  Preparation for Varied  UAS Activities, from  Inspecting Utilities to  Carrying Passengers Research conducted at the test sites has provided information to FAA  that, according to agency officials, supports its efforts to integrate UAS  into the national airspace system.

501,"Defense Agencies  Have Processes to  Set Rates That Are  Designed to Cover  Costs but Are Not  Transparent in Their  Pricing We found that DFAS, DISA, and DLA have applied two of the three  components of the key operating principle for working capital fund self- sufficiency by setting rates that are designed to cover actual costs and  establishing a management review for rate setting.
Defense Agencies Have  Processes to Set Rates  That Are Designed to  Recover Actual Costs and  Have Established  Management Review for  Rate Setting DFAS, DISA, and DLA each develop budget proposals annually that are  designed to recover their projected costs, while also accounting for any  gain or loss from previous years.
While we found that DFAS, DISA, and DLA have taken steps intended to  establish an equitable pricing methodology, military department officials  from the offices we contacted said that they lack visibility into the factors  that determine their costs at one or more of the three defense agencies.
By providing more complete and transparent information on  methodologies used to calculate rates, the costs used in those  calculations, and how changes in workload affect a customer’s rates,  DFAS, DISA, and DLA could improve their communication with their  customers and allow their customers to better understand and make  decisions to help them manage the costs of the goods and services that  they obtain.

502,"The National Action Plan set five major  goals over 5 years related to (1) slowing the emergence of resistant  bacteria and preventing the spread of resistant infections; (2)  strengthening national One-Health surveillance efforts to combat  resistance; (3) advancing the development and use of rapid and  innovative diagnostic tests for the identification and characterization of  resistant bacteria; (4) accelerating basic and applied R&D for new  antibiotics, other therapeutics, and vaccines; and (5) improving  international collaboration and capacities related to the first four goals.
(See table 2 for a description  of each system and the resistant bacteria it tracks.) According to CDC and other officials and documents we reviewed,  including the National Action Plan Year 3 Progress Report, CDC has  taken the following actions, among others, to expand surveillance in order  to better assess the scope of antibiotic resistance: Established the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network in 2016 to  improve testing capacity to better identify antibiotic resistance in the  United States.
It provides facilities, states,  regions, and the nation with data needed to identify problem areas,  measure the progress of prevention efforts, and ultimately eliminate  health care-associated infections, according to CDC.
CDC established three modules within NHSN that allow hospitals to  report select antibiotic-resistant infections, among other things, which  include reporting required by states or by CMS, according to agency  officials.
Without reporting  its plans to address such barriers, the CARB Task Force has not provided  all the information required by the Executive Order and has not fully  carried out its role to facilitate and monitor implementation of the National  Action Plan, which may reduce the effectiveness of federal efforts to  combat antibiotic resistance.
For example, some health care facilities are not using the most up-to-date  testing methods for determining whether the bacteria causing an infection  are resistant to certain antibiotics, according to CDC officials and a report  from the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force.
CDC officials told us this length of time between reports  was in part because, following issuance of the 2013 Threats Report, the  agency was focused on implementing priority actions to improve antibiotic  resistance surveillance data, including those efforts prescribed by the  National Action Plan.
For example, in 2017, PACCARB reported that  “there is a lack of clinical and economic outcome studies showing that  any diagnostic test could prevent the emergence of antibiotic-resistant  bacteria and would be cost effective.” Officials we interviewed from  AHRQ, BARDA, CDC, FDA, and NIH all agreed with that PACCARB  statement.
In this  case, monitoring and evaluation of the status of breakpoint updates in  FDA-authorized tests could help FDA identify and address the National  Action Plan sub-objective, as well as a strategic priority in the mission  statement of its Center for Devices and Radiological Health: “FDA  assures that patients and providers have timely and continued access to  safe, effective and high-quality medical devices.” FDA officials said they do not believe the issue is a significant problem,  but the agency has also not regularly evaluated any effects of using tests  for antibiotic resistance with out-of-date breakpoints.
In turn, CDC and experts say  that more antibiotic use data would enable health care providers, federal  agencies, and others to identify and target areas for improvement, track  results over time, and adjust antibiotic stewardship activities as  needed.
CDC officials also told us  that the agency lacks the authority to require hospitals to report their  antibiotic use data, and that there is currently no federal funding available  to assist hospitals with the investment needed to participate in the AU  Option.
However, in its progress reports covering the first four years of the  National Action Plan’s implementation—which were provided to the  President and the public—the CARB Task Force has not identified plans  to address barriers that agencies face in expanding antibiotic stewardship  programs across health care settings.
Until the CARB Task Force identifies and reports on  agencies’ plans to address barriers related to the expansion of antibiotic  stewardship programs and the collection of antibiotic use data across  health care settings to the extent feasible, the federal government will not  have reasonable assurance that it is fully implementing the National  Action Plan and addressing antibiotic resistance.
Steps by federal  agencies to expand surveillance, facilitate the development and use of  new diagnostic tests, fund R&D for the development of new treatments,  and issue requirements and guidance for antibiotic stewardship programs  are important efforts toward addressing the problem of antibiotic  resistance and implementing the National Action Plan.
By developing a plan for more frequent dissemination  of consolidated reporting on priority pathogens at regular intervals, CDC  would have more timely trend data and other information necessary for  users of the data, including policymakers, to prioritize, plan, implement,  and evaluate public health actions to address antibiotic resistance.
By developing a plan for more frequent dissemination  of consolidated reporting on priority pathogens at regular intervals, CDC  would have more timely trend data and other information necessary for  users of the data, including policymakers, to prioritize, plan, implement,  and evaluate public health actions to address antibiotic resistance.
Finally, in its progress reports covering the first four years of the National  Action Plan’s implementation, the CARB Task Force did not identify  plans, as required by the Executive Order, to address barriers that  agencies face in fully implementing the National Action Plan, such as  expanding (1) a CDC program designed to strengthen the U.S. response  to resistant gonorrhea; (2) antibiotic stewardship programs across health  care settings; and (3) antibiotic use data collection, to the extent feasible."
503,"Before  making an award, the FAR requires that contracting officers review the  subcontracting plan to help ensure that the required information, goals,  and assurances—such as a contractor committing to submit periodic  reports to the government to determine the extent of compliance with the  subcontracting plan—are included.
Additionally, the FAR requires  contracting officers to provide the SBA Procurement Center  Representative (PCR)—SBA staff whose responsibility includes  supporting agency contracting opportunities for small businesses—with  an opportunity to review the proposed contract, including the  subcontracting plan and supporting documentation.
In carrying out their post-award  oversight responsibilities, the FAR requires contracting officers to (1)  ensure contractors file their subcontracting reports in eSRS within 30 days of the close of each reporting period (a report is also required for  each contract within 30 days of contract completion); (2) review ISRs, and  where applicable SSRs, in eSRS within 60 days of the reporting end date;  and (3) acknowledge receipt of, accept, or reject the reports in eSRS (see  fig.1).
Reviews Selected Agencies  Conducted Also Found Limited  Monitoring of Contractor  Report Submissions Additionally, officials from all four agencies told us they conduct some  type of periodic review related to oversight of subcontracting plans, which  can include determining compliance with the subcontracting plan and  related reporting requirements.
For example, NASA: According to an agency official, NASA’s Office of Small  Business Programs conducts procurement management reviews of  subcontracting plans every 2–3 years.
For the third contract, awarded in fiscal year 2016 for  $45.2 million with a planned small business subcontracting goal of 10  percent of total subcontracting dollars, the contractor listed this goal  incorrectly in two ISRs. According to a NASA official, at the time of our  review, the contracting officer was working with the contractor to  correct the error.
For one GSA Federal Acquisition  Service contract awarded in fiscal year 2017 for $3.6 million, we found  a discrepancy between the small business goal reported in multiple  ISR submissions—5 percent of total subcontracting dollars—and the  25 percent goal of total subcontracting dollars in the approved  subcontracting plan, and we notified the agency of the discrepancy.
SBA Conducts  Training and Reviews  for Its Subcontracting  Program, but Has  Very Limited  Documentation of  Recent Reviews SBA provides training to federal agencies’ contracting officers and  contractors to assist in complying with small business subcontracting plan  requirements."
504,"ORD officials said in funding research, they also consider other  clinical and research needs that are not identified as priorities but are still  important to veterans’ health, such as encouraging researchers to test  new ideas.
According to ORD officials, the  directors of the four ORD research services—the biomedical laboratory,  clinical science, health services, and rehabilitation research and  development services—have latitude to set their own priorities, given their  expertise in, and the particular focus of, their respective research areas.
The leadership of ORD’s rehabilitation research  service, for example, told us they review VA data on the top service- connected conditions for which veterans are receiving disability  benefits, and take that factor into consideration, along with less  prevalent conditions such as spinal cord injuries, that also have a  significant impact on veterans’ function and independence when  setting priorities.
In addition to the research priorities, ORD officials said they consider  other clinical and research needs when determining which health care  research efforts to fund.
Similarly, health services research service officials told us that service’s  new effort to build consortiums of researchers focused together on a  particular priority area may also facilitate coordination between  researchers and clinical program offices, particularly on key topics for VA,  such as suicide prevention and opioids."
505,"The 42 states  with separate CHIP programs—including those in combination CHIP  states—are required to submit CHIP plans that describe reasonable  procedures to prevent crowd-out and to report annually to CMS on certain  crowd-out related indicators, such as the number of CHIP applicants with  access to private health insurance; however, CMS provides states  flexibility to decide which crowd-out prevention procedures to use.
In response to crowd-out related recommendations we made in 2009,  CMS modified its guidance to collect additional information from states in  their 2009 through 2013 annual reports on how they assess the  availability and affordability of private health insurance for CHIP  applicants.
However, CMS officials stated that the agency eliminated the questions  regarding affordability of private health insurance in 2013, as part of  efforts to update the electronic system states use to submit their CHIP  annual reports to reflect PPACA enrollment simplification and  coordination requirements."
506,"NNSA places a premium on safety throughout all phases of  explosives activities, including research and development, testing,  production, and storage, because handling any explosive material is  inherently dangerous, according to NNSA officials and contractor  representatives.
The leading practices in federal strategic  planning that we selected are: (1) involving stakeholders, such as federal  agencies, state governments, or others, in defining the mission and  desired outcomes, which helps ensure that their expectations and  interests are met and that resources and efforts are targeted at the  program’s highest priorities; (2) assessing external and internal forces,  which helps managers anticipate future challenges and make  adjustments before potential problems become crises; and (3) covering at  least a 4-year period while making adjustments as needed to reflect the  operating environment.
As NNSA officials and contractor  representatives explained during our site visits to Livermore and  Pantex, Livermore scientists redeveloped the specific process for  TATB synthesis and formulation that is being used in the W80-4 LEP,  first in small test batches and then in larger amounts.
This research effort seeks to  introduce additive manufacturing into the explosives production  process, producing explosive parts with highly complex geometries  while meeting NNSA’s safety and performance requirements,  according to a contractor representative.
According to  NNSA documents, the coordinating committee met twice in 2018 and  identified a number of future actions requiring input from the sites,  such as defining future needs associated with the production of main  charge explosive materials.
However, based on our review of the strategic plan, it does not discuss  three of the challenges that NNSA officials and contractor representatives  had identified: the quality of data on infrastructure information, workforce  levels, and safety.
First, the data quality challenge related to infrastructure  information, such as inaccuracies in FIMS, is not discussed in the  strategic plan, although NNSA officials and contractor representatives we  interviewed identified it as a challenge that may affect its planning and  decision-making related to explosives activities."
507,"DOD’s actions for the asset visibility segment of this high-risk area  included (1) providing guidance for the military components to consider  key attributes of successful performance measures during metric  development for their improvement initiatives; (2) incorporating into after- action reports, information relating to performance measures; and (3)  demonstrating sustained progress by, for example, increasing its visibility  of assets through radio-frequency identification (RFID), an automated  data-capture technology that can be used to electronically identify, track,  and store information contained on a tag.
DOD’s actions for the materiel distribution segment of this high-risk area  included (1) making progress in developing its suite of distribution  performance metrics; (2) incorporating distribution metrics, as  appropriate, on the performance of all legs of the distribution system,  including the tactical leg; (3) making progress in refining its Materiel  Distribution Improvement Plan and incorporating additional actions based  on interim progress and results; and (4) improving its capability to  comprehensively measure distribution performance, identifying  distribution problems and root cause, and implementing solutions.
NOAA’s actions for polar- orbiting weather satellites that addressed the remaining criteria of action  plan and demonstrated progress included (1) issuing three updates to its  gap mitigation plan between January 2016 and February 2017 to address  shortfalls we had identified previously; and (2) successfully launching the  NOAA-20 satellite in November 2017, which is currently operational and  is being used to provide advanced weather data and forecasts.
DOD’s actions for polar-orbiting weather satellites, pursuant to statutes  and accompanying congressional direction, included DOD leadership (1)  developing and implementing plans to acquire satellites as part of a family  of systems to replace its aging legacy weather satellites, including  awarding a contract for its Weather System Follow-on–Microwave  program, planned for launch in 2022; (2) establishing plans to meet its  highest-priority weather monitoring data collection needs that will not be  covered by the Weather System Follow-on–Microwave program, including  by acquiring and launching the Electro-Optical/Infrared Weather Systems  satellite in 2024; and (3) monitoring the Weather System Follow-on- Microwave satellite program’s progress toward addressing critical needs  and assessing its operations and sustainment costs.
Nineteen of these key recommendations remain open—including  recommendations that the principal members of the PAC (1) conduct an  evidence-based review of investigation and adjudication timeliness  objectives, (2) develop and report to Congress on investigation quality  measures, (3) prioritize the timely completion of efforts to modernize and  secure IT systems that affect clearance holders government-wide, and (4)  develop and implement a comprehensive workforce plan that identifies  the workforce needed to meet current and future demand for background  investigations services and to reduce the investigations backlog.
High-Risk Areas That  Made Progress Agencies can show progress by addressing our five criteria for removal  from the list: leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring,  and demonstrated progress.
DOD has demonstrated leadership commitment by stating its commitment  to addressing key recommendations we have made by, for example, (1)  better forecasting the initial Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) costs  for military construction, IT, and relocating military personnel and  equipment; (2) better aligning infrastructure to DOD force structure needs  by, for example, improving the accuracy and sufficiency of its excess  capacity estimates; and (3) pursuing an effort to consolidate and  standardize leases, which includes analyzing whether it is feasible to  relocate functions from commercial leased space to existing space on an  installation, thereby reducing leases and better utilizing excess space.
The DOD Financial Management high-risk area continues to  partially meet the capacity and action plan criteria and not meet the  demonstrated progress criterion.
FITARA includes specific requirements related to seven areas: the federal data center consolidation initiative, enhanced transparency and improved risk management, agency Chief Information Officer authority enhancements, portfolio review, expansion of training and use of IT acquisition cadres, government-wide software purchasing, and maximizing the benefit of the federal strategic sourcing initiative.
High-Risk Areas  Needing Significant  Attention In the 2 years since our last High-Risk Report, three areas—NASA  Acquisition Management, Transforming EPA's Process for Assessing and  Controlling Toxic Chemicals, and Limiting the Federal Government's  Fiscal Exposure By Better Managing Climate Change Risks—have  regressed in their ratings against our criteria for removal from the High- Risk List.
Our March 2019  report on chemical assessments provides information on what remains to  be done to address challenges in the IRIS program and implement the  Lautenberg Act. Since we added this area to our High-Risk List in 2009, we have made 12  recommendations to EPA related to IRIS and TSCA.
While VHA completed root cause analyses for each area of concern and  developed an action plan in response, the plan lacks milestones and  metrics needed to effectively monitor its implementation and demonstrate  progress made in addressing the high-risk designation.
Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data NOAA’s Polar- Orbiting Weather  Satellites Since our last high-risk update in 2017,  NOAA continues to meet the criteria of  leadership commitment, capacity, and  monitoring and now also meets the criteria  of action plan and demonstrated progress."
508,"In accordance with this guidance, DOD facilitates  public access to commissions’ proceedings by (1) communicating directly  with victims and their family members about the status of scheduled  hearings and other administrative matters; (2) enabling selected members  of the public to view proceedings in-person at NSGB; (3) providing CCTV  sites within the United States for viewing proceedings remotely; and (4)  making information, such as court documents that will be used during  proceedings, available to the public on the commissions’ website.
The program, which falls within the Office of the Chief  Prosecutor, provides updates to victims and their family members on  pending military commission cases, notifies them of scheduled hearings,  and assists with the logistics associated with viewing proceedings at  NSGB or a CCTV site.
In addition, according to non-government stakeholders, DOD provides  limited logistical support for their work at NSGB, which constrains their  ability to provide the public with access to information about the  commissions’ proceedings.
For  example, one national security policy expert told us that they “cannot  afford the time required to attend another hearing.” This is because  “…hearings are frequently cancelled or closed to the public,” and as a  result, attendees “…typically spend at least a week there to see maybe  two days of hearings.” We also spoke with a legal expert who explained  that the lack of reliable internet and phone service while on NSGB  presented challenges in maintaining contact with the individual’s law  practice, thus limiting their ability to travel to NSGB and view proceedings  in-person.
According to various non-government stakeholders, DOD’s inability to  post court documents in a timely manner has negatively impacted their  ability to perform their role in facilitating public access to information  about commissions’ proceedings.
Remote Viewing of  Proceedings Based on our review of relevant court documents and discussions with  DOD officials and stakeholders, we identified two broad categories of  potential options that may help DOD address the public access  challenges associated with CCTV sites: (1) adding or changing the  locations of CCTV sites and (2) broadcasting video from NSGB using  other technologies, such as the internet.
We conducted a survey of victims and their family members to determine  the extent to which respondents support various options for expanding  public access and their views on the timeliness of court document  postings to OMC’s website.
Similarly, we provided standardized question  sets to non-government stakeholders and analyzed responses from the  completed questionnaires to determine the extent to which respondents  support various options for expanding public access as well as their views  on other issues, such as the timeliness with which court document are  posted to OMC’s website."
509,"For example, a Defense  Microelectronics Activity official told us that their agency generally  completes its proposal review process within 90 days, but does not  notify awardees until it has determined funding availability for awards  later in the fiscal year.
Timeliness of SBIR  and STTR Award  Issuance Overall, component agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 awards we  reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period, for fiscal  years 2016 through 2018."
510,"The key factors the selected states considered in ranking the bases of  eligibility, according to state officials, included (1) whether eligibility was  related to the receipt of benefits from other programs, (2) the services  provided through the benefit package, and (3) the financial implications  for the individual.
The accuracy issues identified in the audits we reviewed  generally fell into nine broad categories, such as eligibility determinations  made with incorrect or incomplete income or asset information,  unresolved discrepancies between what applicants reported as their  income and electronic data sources, and unidentified or unaddressed  changes in circumstances, such as changes in household income or  size.
(See table 2.) Within these nine broad categories, the audits identified several specific  accuracy issues, including states that were not conducting income checks for individuals reporting no income; not terminating the enrollment of individuals who had moved out of enrolling individuals who did not provide required information (such as  proof of citizenship) on a timely basis; months or years behind schedule in conducting required eligibility not acting on—or not having adequate systems in place to detect— changes in enrollees’ circumstances that could affect eligibility, such  as changes in income or household composition."
511,"HRSA provides guidance to states on how to report  their MOE spending in the annual NOFOs. For example, since fiscal year  2013, the MOE guidance in the NOFOs generally has directed states to  only report spending that meets the following criteria: paid for with state general funds,  spent in the prior fiscal year on HHS approved evidence-based  programs that include home visiting as a primary service delivery  strategy,  implemented in response to findings from the most current statewide  needs assessment, and offered on a voluntary basis to pregnant women or caregivers of  children from birth to kindergarten entry."
512,"NNSA initially intended to  house the analytical chemistry capabilities to support enriched  uranium processing and material characterization in the UPF before  re-scoping the project to meet its cost and schedule goals.
NNSA  officials stated they organized the independent cost estimates in this way  to meet DOE requirements and appropriations limitations but still be able  to begin work on the aspects of the overall UPF project that need to be  completed earliest.
Then, DOE-PM  drew from the independent cost estimates that included work for the Main  Process Building, Salvage and Accountability Building, and Process  Support Facilities subprojects to complete its external independent review  of the UPF project in March 2018.
NNSA officials stated that they estimated uranium program life-cycle  costs from fiscal years 2016 through 2026 because they could not  accurately estimate some of the activities in the program’s scope of work  that are enduring for the nuclear security enterprise rather than specific  projects with finite schedules for construction."
513,"In 2016, we reported that FDA told us that the rare  pediatric disease PRV program placed a substantial strain on its  workload, explaining that performing a priority review on a drug that would  otherwise merit a standard review requires the agency to conduct  significant work in a compressed time frame.
The number of PRVs awarded by FDA could influence the effectiveness  of the PRV programs as incentives, according to several drug sponsors,  researchers, and stakeholders we contacted."
514,"In August 2018, we reported that improvements in oversight of state  expenditures could help CMS ensure that individuals are enrolled in the  correct Medicaid eligibility group.
GAO, Medicaid: Additional Efforts Needed to Ensure that State Spending is Appropriately Matched  with Federal Funds, GAO-16-53 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 16, 2015)."
515,
516,"IHS officials we interviewed  noted several reasons why third-party collections may vary over time and  by location, including  the size of the facility and any changes in the number of providers,  patients, or business office staff that process billing and collections;  the ability to collect payment from certain tribal health insurance,  which may opt to not pay for services provided to enrolled members;  and  the number of patients enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans,  which may identify IHS facilities as out-of-network providers and not  pay for covered services.
Expanding Services  Offsite Officials from IHS, as well as some of the 17 selected federally operated  and tribally operated facilities, told us that increased coverage and  collections allowed for an expansion in the complexity of services  provided offsite through the PRC program.
Specifically, officials reported  that an increase in the percent of patients with health insurance, coupled  with facilities’ enhanced onsite services, has led PRC programs to be  able to expand the level of care that they can offer."
517,"Additionally, the 2018 Farm Bill requires the Secretary of  Agriculture to take a number of actions to address FLW: (1) create a FLW  Reduction Liaison to coordinate federal, state, local, and  nongovernmental programs, and other efforts, to measure and reduce the  incidence of FLW; (2) conduct a study on food waste in consultation with  the FLW Reduction Liaison and report data collected on food waste and  efforts to reduce and prevent such waste; (3) issue guidance outlining the  best practices to minimize food waste for donated commodities; (4) enter  into cooperative agreements with local or municipal governments to  develop and test strategies for planning and implementing municipal  compost plans and food waste reduction plans; (5) establish a milk  donation program to encourage the donation of milk products produced  and processed in the United States, assist individuals in low-income  groups, and reduce food waste; and (6) establish a Local Agriculture  Market Program to, among other things, promote new business  opportunities and marketing strategies to reduce on-farm food waste.
FDA was not involved with establishing the  national FLW reduction goal in 2015 but, according to agency officials,  has become more engaged in consumer education and outreach to the  food industry, hunger relief and food rescue organizations, state and local  governments, academia, and other stakeholders on issues related to  FLW.
For example, USDA ERS reports that  there is a practical limit to how much FLW in the United States could be  reduced, given different factors, such as food safety concerns, the  perishability of foods, storage and temperature considerations, and risk  management for production and marketing uncertainties, and resource  constraints to recover uneaten food for another use, among others.
For  example, EPA and USDA have taken actions to provide improved data  and information about FLW in the United States; educate and increase  awareness of FLW along the food supply chain; and expand the  infrastructure and capacity to support efforts to reduce FLW.
To further provide information, raise awareness, and educate different  stakeholders along the food supply chain, EPA and USDA have  collaborated on the following FLW reduction efforts: A Guide to Conducting Student Food Waste Audits."
518,"Full  benefits are generally available to those who served on active duty for 36  months, for which VA will pay the net cost for in-state tuition and fees at  public schools and up to an annual maximum amount at nonprofit and for- profit schools ($24,477 in academic year 2019-2020)."
519,"Use of VA’s FSS Was  Flat While Overall  VHA Spending Rose,  but NAC Lacks  Controls to Verify  Sales Data and  Visibility into Small  Business  Participation and  User Experience VHA used NAC’s FSS to purchase billions of dollars in medical supplies  and services over the past 5 years.
(Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the Associate  Executive Director of VA’s NAC assesses data on the participation of and  items and services offered by veteran-owned small businesses in NAC’s  FSS program, in order to determine whether their program is meeting the  needs of VHA contracting officers who use it given the Veterans First  requirements they must meet.
(Recommendation 4) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the Associate  Executive Director of VA’s NAC develops an FSS-specific training  program to include essential skills and processes to meet ongoing  training needs for new and existing contracting staff.
(Recommendation 8) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the Associate  Executive Director of VA’s NAC assesses the appropriateness of NAC’s  current timeliness goals for FSS contract awards and takes steps to  comprehensively identify and address barriers to achieving them.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report assesses: (1) what is known about the Department of  Veterans Affairs’ (VA) use of its Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program  for fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) challenges the National Acquisition  Center (NAC) faces in effectively managing the FSS program, (3) the  extent to which NAC awarded FSS contracts in a timely manner from  fiscal years 2014 through 2018, and (4) the extent to which FSS and the  Medical-Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) programs  provide overlapping or duplicative offerings.
To assess what is known about VA’s use of its FSS program from fiscal  years 2014 through 2018, we analyzed quarterly vendor sales report data  provided by NAC."
520,"According to NHTSA officials, the bumper standard is intended to  prevent damage to the car body and safety related equipment at  speeds equivalent to a 5 miles-per-hour (mph) crash into a parked  vehicle of the same weight.
Although NHTSA officials reported  that they had a plan to review and evaluate individual cases, NHTSA  does not have an evaluation plan for the pilot program that includes  criteria or standards for identifying lessons learned or determining  whether the new data collection and analysis procedures would satisfy  data needs related to pedestrian’s injuries.
Since NCAP Was Last  Updated, NHTSA Contributed  to Developing Global  Pedestrian Regulations and  Conducted Research In the past 10 years, NHTSA has considered but has not yet initiated a  rulemaking process related to international standards for crash mitigation  tests, among other actions.
NHTSA also reported in its 2015  Request for Comments that including pedestrian crash mitigation tests in  NCAP is necessary to stimulate improvements in pedestrian  crashworthiness in new vehicles sold in the United States.
Although NHTSA reported in 2015 that these tests could lead to a  decrease in vehicle-pedestrian crashes and resulting pedestrian injuries  and fatalities, it has yet to make or communicate a decision about the  future of NCAP in relation to pedestrian safety to stakeholders.
Nine of 13  automakers we interviewed told us that a lack of communication from  NHTSA on its plan for addressing pedestrian safety issues has presented  a challenge to them, often because they require long lead times to  develop, test, and launch new technologies.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report: (1) examines what is known about the relationship between  motor vehicle characteristics and pedestrian injuries and fatalities, (2)  describes approaches automakers have taken to address pedestrians’  safety and discusses stakeholders’ perspectives on these approaches,  and (3) evaluates actions the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA) has taken to assess whether pedestrian safety  testing should be included in its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP).
Similar to our analysis of FARS data,  these variables were selected based on our interviews with NHTSA  officials and a review of relevant research about the relationship between  motor vehicle characteristics and pedestrian crashes.
In addition to automakers, equipment suppliers, and auto industry trade  associations, we also interviewed NHTSA and IIHS about crash  avoidance and crash mitigation technology and reviewed applicable  federal regulations related to pedestrian safety."
521,"DOD’s actions for the asset visibility segment of this high-risk area  included (1) providing guidance for the military components to consider  key attributes of successful performance measures during metric  development for their improvement initiatives; (2) incorporating into after- action reports, information relating to performance measures; and (3)  demonstrating sustained progress by, for example, increasing its visibility  of assets through radio-frequency identification (RFID), an automated  data-capture technology that can be used to electronically identify, track,  and store information contained on a tag.
NOAA’s actions for polar- orbiting weather satellites that addressed the remaining criteria of action  plan and demonstrated progress included (1) issuing three updates to its  gap mitigation plan between January 2016 and February 2017 to address  shortfalls we had identified previously; and (2) successfully launching the  NOAA-20 satellite in November 2017, which is currently operational and  is being used to provide advanced weather data and forecasts.

Among other things, VA should implement our 21 open recommendations  and specifically needs to take the following steps to demonstrate greater  leadership commitment and strategic planning to ensure efficient use of  its acquisition funding and staffing resources: Prioritize completing the revision of its acquisition regulations, which has been in process since 2011.
High-Risk Areas That  Made Progress Agencies can show progress by addressing our five criteria for removal  from the list: leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring,  and demonstrated progress.
DOD has demonstrated leadership commitment by stating its commitment  to addressing key recommendations we have made by, for example, (1)  better forecasting the initial Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) costs  for military construction, IT, and relocating military personnel and  equipment; (2) better aligning infrastructure to DOD force structure needs  by, for example, improving the accuracy and sufficiency of its excess  capacity estimates; and (3) pursuing an effort to consolidate and  standardize leases, which includes analyzing whether it is feasible to  relocate functions from commercial leased space to existing space on an  installation, thereby reducing leases and better utilizing excess space.
However, DOD’s efforts to improve its financial management continue to  be impaired by long-standing issues—including its decentralized  environment; cultural resistance to change; lack of skilled financial  management staff; ineffective processes, systems, and controls;  incomplete corrective action plans; and the need for more effective  monitoring and reporting.
The DOD Financial Management high-risk area continues to  partially meet the capacity and action plan criteria and not meet the  demonstrated progress criterion.
FITARA includes specific requirements related to seven areas: the federal data center consolidation initiative, enhanced transparency and improved risk management, agency Chief Information Officer authority enhancements, portfolio review, expansion of training and use of IT acquisition cadres, government-wide software purchasing, and maximizing the benefit of the federal strategic sourcing initiative.
In  November 2018, OMB told us of plans to hold additional meetings  on priority high-risk areas, including the 2020 Decennial Census,  Strategic Human Capital Management, Ensuring the  Cybersecurity of the Nation, National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) Acquisition Management, and Managing  Federal Real Property.
In December 2019,  we will report on OMB’s progress in implementing PMIAA,  including what further steps it has taken to use the portfolio review  process required in PMIAA to address issues on our High-Risk  List.
High-Risk Areas  Needing Significant  Attention In the 2 years since our last High-Risk Report, three areas—NASA  Acquisition Management, Transforming EPA's Process for Assessing and  Controlling Toxic Chemicals, and Limiting the Federal Government's  Fiscal Exposure By Better Managing Climate Change Risks—have  regressed in their ratings against our criteria for removal from the High- Risk List.
In addition, while NASA has taken some steps to build capacity to help  reduce acquisition risk, including updating tools aimed at improving cost  and schedule estimates, other areas still require attention.
These  recommendations include that NASA needs to improve transparency of  major project cost and schedule estimates, especially for its human  spaceflight programs, as well as continue to build capacity to reduce  acquisition risk.
Our March 2019  report on chemical assessments provides information on what remains to  be done to address challenges in the IRIS program and implement the  Lautenberg Act. Since we added this area to our High-Risk List in 2009, we have made 12  recommendations to EPA related to IRIS and TSCA.
Over the years since we added PBGC to the High-Risk List, we have  suggested a number of matters for congressional consideration,  including: (1) authorizing a redesign of PBGC’s single employer program  premium structure to better align premium rates with sponsor risk; (2)  adopting additional changes to PBGC’s governance structure—in  particular, expanding the composition of its board of directors; (3)  strengthening funding requirements for plan sponsors as appropriate  given national economic conditions; (4) working with PBGC to develop a  strategy for funding PBGC claims over the long term as the defined  benefit pension system continues to decline; and (5) enacting additional  structural reforms to reinforce and stabilize the multiemployer system,  and balance the needs and potential sacrifices of contributing employers,  participants, and the federal government.
While VHA completed root cause analyses for each area of concern and  developed an action plan in response, the plan lacks milestones and  metrics needed to effectively monitor its implementation and demonstrate  progress made in addressing the high-risk designation."
522,"These actions included, among  others, working with the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to  (1) review, and revise as necessary, behavior detection officer training  policies, training curriculum, and supervisory guidance to ensure they  adequately address and train against profiling; (2) enhance data  collection to facilitate appropriate supervision and monitoring of behavior  detection activities; and (3) ensure passengers are aware of complaint  mechanisms and ensure complaints are appropriately handled.
For example,  TSA has  revised its standard operating procedures and training materials to  more clearly instruct personnel trained in behavior detection and other  TSA personnel on how to avoid unlawful profiling;  initiated a study to collect data on the race and national origin of  passengers referred for behavior detection screening and examine  whether disparities exist in the referral trends, and if so, whether these  differences suggest discrimination or bias in the referral process; and  issued a Management Directive establishing TSA policy and  procedures for receiving, documenting, and referring passenger  screening complaints resulting from the application of TSA security  screening policies and procedures, including processes for all  involved offices in headquarters and the field that handle passenger  complaints.
As a result, Multicultural Branch  sent National Shift Briefings on TSA’s policies and procedures that  prohibit unlawful profiling and inappropriate comments to the TSA  designated point of contact at the airport involved for distribution to  TSA personnel identified in the complaint."
523,"For example, in January 2019 we reported that, in fiscal year 2017  (the most recent year for which these data were available at the time of  our review), EM’s responsibilities to store and treat radioactive waste  stored in underground tanks accounted for nearly half of EM’s total  environmental liability, and its responsibilities for addressing  contaminated facilities and remediating soil and groundwater  contamination accounted for about one-quarter.
We  recommended that DOE review and revise EM’s cleanup policy to  include program and project management leading practices related to  scope, cost, schedule performance, and independent reviews.
However, in January 2019 we found that the information EM  provided to Congress in its fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018 budget  requests did not reflect the funding some senior DOE officials said EM  needs to meet its scheduled cleanup milestones."
524,"According to Bureau  documentation, this change resulted from Bureau analysis and  consultation with stakeholders (including the Maritime Administration)  which found that crewmembers in each of these situations usually retain  an onshore residence in the United States where they live and sleep most  of the time so they should be counted in the same way.
However, unlike the prior method, the incomplete or conflicting  characteristics cannot be filled in or reconciled using other information  about the same person or household reported within the 2020  response or in prior census or other administrative records."
525,"In addition, according to Coast  Guard officials, Direct Access, the Coast Guard’s personnel database,  also collects and maintains information about some court-martial  cases and nonjudicial punishments if the punishment resulted in a  change in rank or pay or an administrative action against the accused  servicemember.
According to service  officials, in the Air Force and the Army these reports include demographic  information about servicemembers involved in these cases, such as the  total number of each type of case broken out by the subject’s race,  ethnicity, or gender, but the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard reports do not include this demographic information, and there is no  requirement to do so.
Specifically, we  found that: Black, Hispanic, and male servicemembers were more likely than  White and female servicemembers to be the subjects of recorded  investigations in all of the military services, and were more likely to be  tried in general and special courts-martial in the Army, the Navy, the  Marine Corps, and the Air Force.
Black servicemembers were less likely to receive a more severe  punishment in general and special courts-martial compared to White  servicemembers in the Navy but there was no statistically significant  difference for Black servicemembers in the Marine Corps, the Army,  and the Air Force.
For the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force, Black,  Hispanic, and male servicemembers were more likely than White and  female servicemembers to be tried in general and special courts-martial  after controlling for other attributes, as shown in figure 6 below.
Specifically, as shown in figure 7 below, we found that Black, Hispanic,  Other, and male servicemembers in the Army, Hispanic servicemembers  in the Marine Corps, and males in the Air Force were more likely than  White or female servicemembers to be tried in general and special courts- martial following a recorded investigation, after controlling for other  attributes.
As part of our data reliability checks, we identified the  total number of nonjudicial punishments that the Army, the Navy, and the  Coast Guard reported in the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces  annual reports for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, and compared these  totals to the number of cases we identified in their military justice and  personnel databases.
Few Statistically  Significant Racial or  Gender Disparities Exist in  Likelihood of Conviction or  Severity of Punishment,  but the Coast Guard Does  Not Collect and Maintain  Complete Data Race Was Not a Statistically  Significant Factor in  Convictions in General and  Special Courts-Martial, but  Gender Was in the Marine  Corps Among the servicemembers convicted in general and special courts- martials, we found no statistically significant differences regarding the  likelihood of conviction among racial groups in the Army, the Navy, the  Marine Corps, and the Air Force, while controlling for other attributes, as  shown in figure 12 below.
In the military services that maintained complete punishment data—the  Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force—we found that  minority servicemembers were either less likely to receive a more severe  punishment in general and special courts-martial compared to White  servicemembers, or there were no statistically significant differences in  punishments among racial groups.
We could not determine disparities in case outcomes—convictions and  punishment severity—in the Coast Guard’s general and special courts- martial for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 because the Coast Guard did  not collect and maintain complete conviction and punishment data in its  military justice database.
DOD concurred with our six recommendations to present  servicemembers’ race and ethnicity data in each of the military services’  respective investigations and personnel databases using the same  categories of race and ethnicity established for their military justice  databases; consider an amendment to the UCMJ’s annual military justice  reporting requirements to require the military services to include  demographic information for all types of courts-martial; and consider the  feasibility of collecting and maintaining complete information for all  nonjudicial punishment cases.
In addition to requesting the race, ethnicity, and gender of  servicemembers subject to military justice actions, we also requested  other demographic and administrative attribute data—such as rank, age,  years of service, duty station, and occupation—from the services’  personnel databases to include in our statistical models.
We analyzed data from the military services’  investigations, military justice, and personnel databases to determine the  extent to which racial and gender groups were the subjects of recorded  investigations, tried in courts-martial, and subject to nonjudicial  punishments (for Army and Marine Corps, services for which we had  complete data) at higher rates or lower rates than each racial and gender  group’s proportion of the overall service populations.
Appendix II: Summary Statistics and  Bivariate Results for Regression Analyses Rate and Likelihood of  Recorded Investigations  by Race and Gender As shown in figure 15 below, our analysis of data contained in the military  services’ military criminal investigations databases found that Black  servicemembers were subjects of recorded investigations at a higher rate  compared to their proportion of the overall service population in all of the  military services."
526,"As depicted in figure 1, we reported in October 2017  that key biodefense agencies, including DHS, DOD, HHS, USDA, and  EPA, rely on intelligence and global surveillance information, scientific  study of disease agent characteristics, and analysis to better understand  threats and help make decisions about biodefense investments.
Further, we reported in May  2018 that although the awards funded by supplemental appropriations  have allowed state and local public health departments, laboratories, and  hospitals to surge during a threat—for example, the H1N1influenza and  Zika viruses—most of the 10 non-federal stakeholders we interviewed, as  well as HHS officials said that the timing of these awards can result in  challenges to carrying out preparedness and response activities during  infectious disease threats."
527,"Background Over the next 10 years, the Navy plans to continue developing critical  technologies, complete detail design, and begin construction of the lead  Columbia class submarine.
The Navy established  the design maturity goal for Columbia based on lessons learned from the  Virginia class program, when the shipbuilder began constructing the lead  submarine with only 76 percent of arrangements and 43 percent of  disclosures completed and, subsequently, realized 21 percent cost  growth.
In particular, we found that the cost  estimate does not accurately reflect program costs because it is based on  overly optimistic labor hour assumptions, and  is not fully credible because while the Navy conducted risk and  sensitivity analyses to test the likelihood of achieving its assumptions,  it selected a specific cost estimate that informs the program’s budget  which does not include any margin in case those assumptions are not  achieved.
Navy officials stated they plan to update the Columbia class cost estimate  in support of DOD’s decision to authorize construction of the lead  submarine and this decision is expected to occur in summer 2020.
Further, Columbia’s program management and the milestone decision  authority selected $115 billion as the program’s procurement cost  estimate, without adjusting for the likelihood of cost growth in the design  or construction of Columbia class submarines identified in the risk  analysis.
Congress May Not Have  Up-to-Date Cost  Information When  Considering Columbia  Class Budget Request for  Lead Submarine Funding Navy officials stated that they plan to update the cost estimate for the  lead submarine in support of a planned Defense Acquisition Board  review, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.
However, the Navy and  DOD’s general timeframes do not provide assurance that the planned  update of the cost estimate would be completed prior to the fiscal year  2021 budget request, which will include funding for lead submarine  construction, as shown in figure 13 below.
To assess the Navy’s progress and what challenges, if any, are  associated with meeting design goals and preparing for lead submarine  construction, we reviewed Navy and shipbuilder documents, including  program briefings, schedules, and contract status reports to assess the  schedule and performance risks of the Columbia class program."
528,"Additionally, according to agency  officials at all four land management agencies, due to resource  constraints, many of their field units do not have any law enforcement  officers or have a limited law enforcement presence, which limits the  agencies’ ability to respond to and therefore record incidents of  threats and assaults.
According to agency officials we interviewed,  where available, agency law enforcement officers respond to  incidents, including threats and assaults against employees.
For example, during the armed occupation of  the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, FWS officials said the agency  deployed FWS law enforcement officers from around the country to  field units in western states to provide additional security for FWS  employees.
For example, officials we interviewed from all four  agencies said that they receive intelligence information from various  sources, including Interior’s Office of Law Enforcement and Security,  the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, Federal Protective  Service, and Joint Terrorism Task Forces.
Officials from BLM, the Forest Service, and the  Park Service acknowledged that completing the remaining facility security  assessments is important and that developing an agency-wide plan to do  so may help them as they work towards compliance with this ISC  Standard requirement.
In addition, as of June 2019, BLM, FWS, and the Park Service do not  have facility security assessment methodologies that fully comply with two  key requirements in the ISC Standard—namely, to consider the 33  undesirable events identified in the Standard and to evaluate risk factors  for each of these events.
(Recommendation 2) The Director of the Park Service should develop a plan to conduct all  required facility security assessments agency-wide, taking into  consideration the agency’s organizational structure, available  resources, and training needs."
529,"Specifically, we identified three weaknesses: (1) contract  integrity checks do not assess whether contracts require hospitals to  serve the 340B-specified low-income population; (2) guidance for  auditors’ review of contracts has not been consistently documented and  lacks detail; and (3) HRSA allows hospitals to avoid audit findings by  entering into new contracts with state and local governments while audits  are being conducted.
HRSA’s contract  integrity checks for newly registering nongovernmental hospitals are  limited to verifying that contracts clearly list the names of the hospital and  unit of government and have appropriate signatures and dates;  procedures for conducting these checks do not instruct staff to review  whether the contracts require hospitals to provide health care services to  the 340B-specified low-income population, as required to participate in  the 340B Program.
(Recommendation 2) The Administrator of HRSA should amend its contract integrity check  procedures for the 340B Program to include a review of whether  hospitals’ contracts with state and local governments require the  provision of health care services to low-income individuals not eligible  for Medicaid or Medicare as required by statute, and should provide  guidance for staff to conduct these reviews.
(Recommendation 3) The Administrator of HRSA should provide more specific guidance for  340B Program auditors on how to determine if nongovernmental  hospitals’ contracts with state and local governments require the  provision of health care services to low-income individuals not eligible  for Medicaid or Medicare."
530,"Of these proposals, the administration  reported progress toward four of the five reforms we selected for review:  (1) moving personnel security clearance background investigations from  OPM to DOD; (2) solving the cybersecurity workforce shortage; (3)  establishing the GEAR Center; and (4) reorganizing OPM.
The Extent to Which  Key Practices for  Effective Reforms  Were Followed Has  Varied, and Agencies  Identified Some Legal  Authorities for  Implementation Moving Background  Investigations from OPM  to DOD: Most Selected  Key Practices Addressed We added the government-wide personnel security clearance process to  our High-Risk List in January 2018 because it continues to face  challenges in the timely processing of clearances, measuring the quality  of investigations, and ensuring the security of related information  technology (IT) systems.
While  OMB and lead agencies have considered our related high-risk work, the  reform proposal and implementation plans do not demonstrate how the  transfer and delegation of background investigation functions from OPM  to DOD will address these challenges.
In March 2019, we reported that, to make progress  on removing the Government-wide Personnel Security Clearance  Process from our High-Risk List, OPM and DOD should develop and  implement a comprehensive strategic workforce plan that identifies the  workforce needed to meet the current and future demand for its services,  as well as reduce the current backlog to a manageable level.
The Director of OMB, working with DHS, should develop a government- wide communications strategy to inform and, as appropriate, involve  Congress, employees, and other stakeholders in implementation of the  reform proposal to solve the cybersecurity workforce shortage.
(Recommendation 2) The Director of OMB, working with DHS, should develop a government- wide implementation plan with goals, timelines, key milestones, and  deliverables to track and communicate implementation progress of the  reform proposal to solve the cybersecurity workforce shortage.
(Recommendation 3) The Director of OMB, working with DHS, should provide additional  information to describe how the projects and activities associated with the  reform proposal to solve the cybersecurity workforce shortage will  address our high-risk issues related to ensuring the cybersecurity of the  nation.
We found that the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and the two lead agencies (OPM and GSA) had generally  not addressed key practices for reforms, such as establishing outcome- oriented goals, assessing costs and benefits, or developing an  implementation plan, and had not fully involved or communicated their  efforts with Congress, employees, and other key stakeholders."
531,"International Boundary  and Water Commission IBWC’s mission is to provide binational solutions to issues that arise  during the application of U.S.-Mexico treaties regarding, among other  things, water quality and flood control in the border region including  constructing and operating wastewater treatment plants, as directed by  Congress.
Under  the program, EPA works with federal agencies—including USIBWC—and  state and local agencies to build grant-funded projects to improve water  quality in the border area, including wastewater infrastructure projects  that connect to or are related to USIBWC’s two international wastewater  treatment plants in Arizona and California.
The South Bay plant became fully operational in 1999,  providing advanced primary treatment for 25 million gallons of sewage  coming from Mexico daily and discharging treated wastewater 3-miles  offshore in the Pacific Ocean through the South Bay Ocean Outfall, which  is a 3.5-mile-long pipe, according to USIBWC documents.
The United States contributed $224.6 million—specifically, EPA provided  $127.4 million to USIBWC for costs associated with the construction of  the plant and related infrastructure, $89.2 million to the City of San Diego  and the Corps to construct the South Bay Ocean Outfall, and $8 million to  the Corps for additional environmental work.
As a result, unmanaged stormwater flows  largely untreated downhill from Mexico, carrying bacteria, trash, and  sediment into the lower portions of the Santa Cruz River Basin and  Tijuana River Valley watersheds where the Nogales and South Bay plants  are located, threatening key infrastructure and complicating water quality  management in the watersheds.
The group is  sampling sewage and other flows at various locations in the United  States and Mexico to establish baseline data for pollutants in the  waters of the Tijuana River watershed according to USIBWC officials.
The County of San Diego is funding an  assessment to identify and prioritize potential projects that could be  implemented in the United States to improve the water quality in the  Tijuana River Valley by addressing transboundary flows of sewage,  trash, and sediment.
Conclusions USIBWC and the Mexican Section of IBWC have successfully developed  binational solutions to water quality issues along the U.S.-Mexico border,  including constructing two international wastewater treatment plants to  treat raw sewage that would otherwise flow into the United States.
Matters for  Congressional  Consideration Congress should consider providing direction and specific authorization  for USIBWC to take action to resolve the long-standing water quality  problems associated with transboundary stormwater flows in the Santa  Cruz River Basin watershed, including identifying alternatives, cost  estimates, funding sources, and time frames, in coordination with federal,  state, and local partners.
(Matter for Consideration 1) Congress should consider providing direction and specific authorization  for USIBWC to take action to resolve the long-standing water quality  problems associated with transboundary stormwater flows in the Tijuana  River Valley watershed, including identifying alternatives to include cost  estimates, funding sources, and time frames, in coordination with federal,  state, and local partners.
The U.S. Commissioner of the IBWC should work with the Mexican  Commissioner to formalize a binational rapid response team to address  sewage infrastructure failures along the U.S.-Mexico border, including the  Nogales and South Bay wastewater treatment plants.
In addition, USIBWC officials stated that the South Bay plant is not  designed and operated to address some of the wastewater that flows into  the Tijuana River Valley watershed.
In addition, USIBWC officials stated that the South Bay plant is not  designed and operated to address some of the wastewater that flows into  the Tijuana River Valley watershed."
532,"As  previously discussed, if a HECM borrower does not pay his or her  property charges, FHA regulations generally require the servicer to pay  the property charges on the borrower’s behalf to help avoid a tax  foreclosure by the local authority and protect the investor’s and FHA’s  interest in the home.
HECM Defaults Have  Increased, and Use of  Foreclosure  Prevention Options Is  Limited or Unknown  Death of the Borrower Is  the Most Common Reason  for HECM Terminations,  but Defaults Have  Increased in Recent Years Our analysis of FHA data found that about 272,155 HECMs terminated  from fiscal years 2014 through 2018.
Our analysis of FHA data showed that 22 percent of  borrowers with property charge defaults were granted a repayment plan  from April 2015 (the effective date of FHA’s current repayment plan  policy) through the end of fiscal year 2018.
Our analysis of FHA data found that from April 2015  (the effective date of FHA’s at-risk extension policy) through the end of  fiscal year 2018, about 2 percent of borrowers with property charge  defaults received an at-risk extension.
To grant an at-risk extension, FHA  requires HECM servicers to provide valid documentation that the  youngest living borrower is at least 80 years of age and has critical  circumstances such as a terminal illness, long-term physical disability, or  a unique occupancy need (for example, terminal illness of family member  living in the home).
Officials said they  were in the planning phase for a new evaluation of the HECM program  but had not set a start date and did not expect the evaluation to include  an analysis of reasons for HECM terminations or the use of foreclosure  prevention options for borrowers in default.
Although FHA  adopted the HERMIT system to improve oversight of the HECM portfolio,  it has not used program data to regularly report key loan performance  information—for example, HECM termination reasons, servicer advances,  and use of foreclosure prevention options.
However, our  review of these regular and ad hoc reports found that many are lists of  loans that meet certain criteria and do not provide summary statistics that  could be used to readily identify patterns or trends in metrics, such as the  number of or reasons for HECM terminations or use of different  foreclosure prevention options.
OMB Circular A- 129 states that agencies should conduct on-site lender and servicer  reviews biennially where possible and annually for lenders and servicers  with substantial loan volumes or those with other risk indicators such as  deterioration in their credit portfolio, default rates above acceptable levels,  or an abnormally high number of reduced or rejected claims.
CFPB’s procedures include reviewing  servicers’ compliance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of  1974 and its implementing regulations (which, among other things,  contain requirements for notifying borrowers of servicing transfers,  responding to borrowers’ written information requests and notices of  error, and disclosures relating to force-placed insurance); the Truth In  Lending Act and its implementing regulations (which impose requirements  on servicers governing the use of late fees and delinquency charges,  provisions for payoff statements, and disclosures regarding rate changes  for adjustable-rate mortgages); and other consumer protection laws.
CFPB officials told us the bureau uses consumer complaints as part of its  criteria for selecting entities to examine, including reverse mortgage  servicers, and to inform its educational publications.
However, FHA does not analyze data for other purposes that could  enhance program oversight, such as determining which HECM servicers  and lenders receive the most complaints, targeting entities for on-site  reviews, or identifying topics that may need additional borrower  education.
Periodically analyzing CFPB consumer complaint data and internally  collected consumer complaint data could help FHA to detect and respond  to consumer protection issues regarding HECMs. Housing Market  Conditions, Exit of  Large Bank Lenders,  and Policy Changes  Help Explain the  Decline in Reverse  Mortgages since  2010 Since 2000, the take-up rate—the ratio of HECM originations to eligible  senior homeowners—has been limited (see fig.
However, FHA  could significantly improve its monitoring of loan outcomes and oversight  of servicing in the HECM program in the following areas: FHA’s lack of comprehensive termination data limits understanding of  the reasons why HECMs end, how the debt is satisfied, and how well  the program is helping seniors age in place.
(Recommendation 1) The FHA Commissioner should establish, periodically review, and report  on performance indicators for the HECM program—such as the  percentage of terminations due to borrower defaults, the proportion of  active HECMs with delinquent property charges, the amount of servicer  advances, and the percentage of distressed borrowers who have  received foreclosure prevention options—and examine the impact of  foreclosure prevention options in the forthcoming HECM program  evaluation.
(Recommendation 8) The FHA Commissioner should periodically analyze available internal and  external consumer complaint data about reverse mortgages to help  inform management and oversight of the HECM program.
The Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau (CFPB) also plays a role in overseeing reverse mortgages,  including HECMs. Our objectives were to examine (1) what FHA data  show about HECM terminations, servicer advances, and the use of  foreclosure prevention options; (2) FHA’s assessment and monitoring of  HECM portfolio performance, servicer advances, and foreclosure  prevention options; (3) FHA’s and CFPB’s oversight of HECM servicers;  (4) how FHA and CFPB collect, analyze, and respond to consumer  complaints about HECMs; and (5) how and why the market for HECMs  has changed in recent years."
533,"TSA Modernization Act  Requirements Pursuant to the TSA Modernization Act, TSA I&A is to identify and review  its Silent Partner and Quiet Skies screening rules, in coordination with  DHS and TSA stakeholders, every 120 days and provide notification to  these stakeholders no later than two days after making a change to a  rule.
TSA has created the Silent Partner and Quiet  Skies Lists to help address these unknown threats by ensuring that  certain potentially higher risk passengers receive enhanced screening  when traveling to, from, or within the United States."
534,"We analyzed initial review times using a statistical regression with  two variables reflecting key features of the NDAs—target time frame for  review of the application under FDA’s PDUFA goals (in days, from FDA’s  receipt of the NDA to FDA’s targeted date for completion of the initial  review) and number of expedited programs (0, 1, or 2 or more)—along  with division as independent variables.
These key features included: whether the NDA had a priority review designation (a designation  applied by FDA if the product would provide a significant therapeutic  improvement in the safety and effectiveness of the prevention,  diagnosis, or treatment of a serious condition when compared to  available drugs) or instead had a standard designation; whether the NDA did or did not involve a new molecular entity—an  active ingredient that had not previously been marketed or approved  for use as a drug in the United States, whether the NDA did or did not involve a major amendment (a  submission, while a pending NDA is under FDA review, of additional  information that may include a major new clinical safety or efficacy  study report or major new analyses of studies, among other things);  and whether the NDA did or did not qualify for an expedited program  (accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation, or fast track  designation), programs intended to help reduce the time involved in  developing or reviewing certain drugs that have the potential to treat  serious or life-threatening conditions.
To determine the extent to which key NDA features contributed to  differences between divisions in the time taken to complete initial reviews,  we conducted a multiple regression analysis of the number of days FDA  took to complete its initial review with division as an independent variable,  along with two other independent variables to control for the key NDA  features: Target time frame for initial review of the NDA under FDA’s  PDUFA goals."
535,"Specific elements of such risk-based policies  include (1) identifying and assigning individuals with key roles for  executing the risk management framework; (2) requiring an agency-wide  assessment of cyber risks; (3) identifying and documenting common  security controls that can be inherited by multiple information systems; (4) developing an agency-wide strategy for monitoring control effectiveness;  (5) requiring system-level risk assessments to be performed and regularly  updated; (6) tailoring system security controls based on risk; (7)  prioritizing remedial actions to correct vulnerabilities identified in plans of  action and milestones (POA&M) based on risk; and (8) using a  determination of risk to make decisions about system operation and use.
For example: GSA’s Associate Chief Information Officer for Enterprise Planning &  Governance stated that a process was implemented to assess cyber  risks as part of the formalized ERM process; however, this official  noted that additional work is still needed to align and incorporate other  regular cybersecurity risk management reporting processes and  communication channels into the broader ERM framework.
OMB’s and DHS’s report was also to  include an action plan to, among other things, adequately protect the executive branch, should the risk determination  identify insufficiencies in agencies’ risk mitigation and acceptance  choices; establish a regular process to reassess and, if appropriate, reissue  the determination and address future recurring and unmet budgetary  needs necessary to manage risk to the executive branch; and  if appropriate, clarify, reconcile, and reissue policies, standards, and  guidelines issued in furtherance of FISMA and the EO, and align them  with the NIST cybersecurity framework.
The CDM initiative, if effectively implemented, has the potential to  assist in addressing challenges agencies identified in establishing  standardized IT capabilities for cybersecurity risk management and  improving the quality of data to provide visibility into cyber risks.
However, without fully addressing challenges related to prioritization  between cybersecurity needs and mission priorities, implementing  consistent risk management policies and procedures, incorporating cyber  risks into enterprise risk management, and establishing a cybersecurity  risk management strategy, OMB and DHS are likely to be missing  opportunities to assist agencies in these key areas.
Recommendations  for  Executive Action We are making the following recommendation to OMB: The Director of OMB should, in coordination with the Secretary of  Homeland Security, establish guidance or other means to facilitate the  sharing of successful approaches for agencies to address challenges  in the areas of (1) managing competing priorities between  cybersecurity and operations, such as when operational needs appear  to conflict with cybersecurity requirements; (2) implementing  consistent cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures  across an agency; (3) incorporating cyber risks into enterprise risk  management, and (4) establishing agencies’ cybersecurity risk  management strategies.
The following 17 agencies concurred with our recommendations and, in  most cases, described steps planned or under way to address them: The Department of Education provided written comments in which it  concurred with our recommendation and stated that the department  will continue its efforts to fully develop a cybersecurity risk  management strategy that includes the definition of risk tolerance and  acceptable risk response strategies.
SBA described steps planned or  under way to address the recommendations, such as updating its  cybersecurity risk management strategy and policies and establishing  a process for an organization-wide cybersecurity risk assessment,  along with estimated completion dates.
Specifically, HHS concurred with our recommendations  to develop a risk management strategy that includes key elements,  establish a process for conducting an agency-wide cybersecurity risk  assessment, and establish and document a process for coordination  between cybersecurity risk management and enterprise risk management  functions.
Appendix III: Details on the Extent to Which  Agencies Developed  a Cybersecurity Risk  Management Strategy Of the 23 civilian Chief Financial Officers Act agencies, seven fully  established a cybersecurity risk management strategy that included key  elements recommended by National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) guidance."
536,"In addition, FDA officials have noted that  including broader patient populations in clinical trials can lead to new  information in a drug’s labeling, which will help communicate the safe and  effective use of these drugs.
In addition, officials from another stakeholder stated at the  time of our review that FDA should explain on the web page the agency’s  role in implementing the federal RTT Act. In May 2019 FDA clarified on its  web page that the federal RTT Act does not require manufacturers to  provide patients access to their investigational drugs and that FDA’s role  includes posting a consolidated annual summary report on the use of  investigational drugs through the federal RTT pathway.
The remaining six of the 29 manufacturers did  not communicate information about whether they would consider requests  for access to investigational drugs outside of clinical trials at the time of  our review, but officials from all six told us they were in the process of  developing content on this topic that they intended to post on their  websites."
537,"According to OJP officials, pre-award and ongoing risk assessment  processes that apply to all OJJDP grantees are the primary way in which  the office identifies fraud risks.
Specifically, according to officials, staff from OJP’s  Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management meet with the OIG two to  three times per year to discuss fraud allegations and ongoing fraud  investigations related to OJJDP grant programs.
Further, according to officials responsible for  managing the fiscal year 2017 effort, the facilitated discussion group did  not determine a specific and measurable fraud risk tolerance for DOJ  grant programs generally nor discuss specific fraud risk management  activities or controls for any specific grant programs.
Although following an iterative  approach to fraud risk management is consistent with leading practices,  until DOJ defines a measurable fraud risk tolerance for the assessed  categories, the department may not effectively allocate limited resources  to address fraud risks—including those associated with OJJDP grant  programs.
Appendix II: GAO Review of Performance  Data and Steps Being Taken to Improve  Data Reliability To provide examples of performance results from three of the Office of  Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention’s (OJJDP) 16 programs  funded in fiscal year 2018, we assessed the reliability of key data  elements and methods used to calculate selected performance  measures."
538,"For  example, accounting adjustments can be recorded monthly, quarterly, or  annually to  record or accrue an activity that is not accounted for in the  organization’s accounting systems, such as certain payroll  expenses;  correct errors identified in processing financial information;  record transactions based on the result of reconciliations;  record additional information at the request of a subsidiary  organization; or  record necessary accounting adjustments caused by accounting  system limitations or timing differences.
Some Types of  Adjustments That  DOD Routinely  Records Indicate  Critical Weaknesses  in DOD’s Processes  and Affect the  Reliability of Its  Financial Information During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, as noted above, DFAS  recorded, at a DOD consolidated level, over 200,000 accounting  adjustments in DOD’s core financial reporting system.
DOD and DFAS  Policies and  Procedures for  Recording Accounting  Adjustments Are  Inadequate and  Inconsistently  Followed Establishing clear policies and procedures for recording accounting  adjustments is crucial for (1) ensuring that accounting adjustments are  properly recorded and adequately supported with documentation;  (2) identifying the underlying causes for the recording of adjustments; and  (3) developing, implementing, and monitoring action plans to reduce the  need for accounting adjustments.
For example, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, system- generated accounting adjustments accounted for over 90 percent of the  total volume of adjustments recorded in DOD’s core financial reporting  system at the consolidated level.
When our results are  projected to the fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter population of 181,947  system-generated adjustments, we estimate that at least 96 percent of  the system-generated accounting adjustments were recorded without  adequate supporting documentation, which is required by DOD’s policy  and procedures and federal internal control standards.
We found that DFAS accountants did not  consistently follow the DOD FMR and DFAS’s policies and procedures for  some of these critical elements, resulting in (1) the failure to maintain  adequate supporting documentation, (2) the recording of out-of-balance  accounting adjustments, and (3) the use of account numbers that do not  comply with the USSGL."
539,"While OMB oversees the implementation of the RTF policy, GSA tracks  and reports key cost performance measures on agencies’ square footage  and cost changes, in accordance with analysis methods it developed in  coordination with OMB.
For example, we found that when GSA decided in fiscal year  2014 to renovate and reduce space in its Chicago, IL, office, it  considered, among other factors, how this project supported GSA’s  government-wide mission to make federal space available to  agencies.
To address our first objective, we analyzed federal data on office space  square footage and costs, and reviewed the two RTF cost measures GSA  developed with OMB to track and report agency performance: (1)  estimated cost avoidance and (2) changes in average cost per square  foot.
To identify changes in agencies’ office space costs, we analyzed  square footage, and rent, operations, and maintenance costs from  Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) data submitted by agencies and  GSA’s Occupancy Agreement data."
540,"While none of the selected agencies systematically tracked property  storage costs, we did identify one Office of Science site, one Department  of Transportation site, and one Department of Justice site that analyzed  the use of specific portions of warehouses for cost allocation purposes.
According to officials at one FAA site we visited, property  custodians do not use specific criteria for identifying unneeded property  because it is obvious when items are no longer needed.
To determine the extent to which selected agencies assess the ongoing  need for property stored in warehouses, we reviewed statutes,  regulations, GSA guidance, our prior work, reports by federal agencies’  Offices of Inspector General, and relevant industry standards related to  property storage and warehousing practices."
541,"In our November 2017 report, we concluded that without adequate  documentation and timely completion of reviews of providers’ clinical  care, VA medical center officials lack the information they need to make  decisions about providers’ privileges, including whether or not to take  adverse privileging actions against providers.
Furthermore, because of its  inadequate oversight, VHA lacks reasonable assurance that VA medical  center officials are reviewing all providers about whom clinical care  concerns have been raised and are taking adverse privileging actions  against the providers when appropriate."
542,"Specifically, our ongoing review  showed (1) the scope of oversight of the physical condition of privatized  housing has been limited; (2) performance metrics focused on quality of  maintenance and resident satisfaction may not provide meaningful  information on the condition of privatized housing; (3) there is a lack of  reliable or consistent data on the condition of privatized housing; and (4)  past DOD reports to Congress on resident satisfaction are unreliable due  to inconsistent handling and calculation of the data, and therefore may be  misleading.
According to OSD and the private partners with whom we  spoke, this guidance was developed through a joint effort with the military  departments and the private partners; it provides a framework where the  metrics for resident satisfaction and maintenance management will  account for a majority of the fee, with project safety and financial  performance weighted less heavily.
Based on our preliminary work, we have determined that information on  resident satisfaction in these reports to Congress on privatized housing  has been unreliable and may be misleading due to variances in the data  the military departments collect and provide to OSD and in OSD’s  calculation and presentation of these data."
543,"Generally, independent contractors, including those that are platform  workers, are to use Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business (Sole  Proprietorship), to report their self-employment revenues and expenses,  and to calculate net income; the Schedule C is to be attached to their  Form 1040.
IRS’s Strategy to  Promote Compliance  by Platform Workers  Features Enhanced  Communication, but  Lacks Key Details for  Monitoring Feedback  and Clarifying  Guidance In response to a February 2019 recommendation by the Treasury  Inspector General for Tax Administration, IRS formed a team of officials  from across the agency to develop a strategy to promote compliance  among platform workers.
As part of the strategy,  IRS developed a communications plan that includes a redesign of IRS  web pages for platform workers and companies, outreach activities to the  workers and various stakeholders, and a review of IRS guidance and  related forms or instructions.
According to IRS officials, the Gig Strategy Team reviewed tax  forms, publications, instructions, and training materials relevant to  independent contractors, including platform workers.
Increasing Information  Reporting on Payments  Made to Platform Workers  Could Help Improve Tax  Compliance Many platform workers are not receiving a Form 1099 on their self- employment income, and therefore may be unaware of their tax reporting  obligations.
(Recommendation 5) The Commissioner of IRS should work with the Secretary of the Treasury  to implement withholding that is voluntary for companies making  payments for services to platform workers and other independent  contractors who choose to participate.
(Recommendation 6) The Commissioner of IRS should assess the impact of withholding that is  voluntary for companies, once implemented, and if warranted, work with  the Secretary of the Treasury on a proposal to Congress that would  require TPSOs to offer tax withholding to platform workers and other  independent contractors who choose to participate.
IRS developed a one-page publication that platform  companies could provide to workers to inform them about tax obligations  (see fig."
544,"For example,  while the FBI collects transportation crime data from law enforcement  agencies about incidents that occur at air, bus, or train terminals— including information on the victim, offender, and location of the crime— the data cannot isolate passenger assaults against airline customer  service agents.
In particular, representatives from all six  selected airport law enforcement agencies we interviewed said providing  data on passenger assaults against airline customer service agents would  require manually reviewing all police reports."

Developing a similar mechanism to formalize the sharing of  information between DOL and IRS regarding IRA prohibited transaction  exemptions could help the agencies better support their current  coordination efforts and identify additional opportunities for greater  collaboration."
547,"For example,  according to the website for Groundspeed Analytics, they use AI and  data science methods to provide information for the commercial  property/casualty insurance industry to help identify potential areas of  profit and enhance the customer experience.
According to the website  for Habit Analytics, they use real-time consumer data, sourced from  smartphones and connected devices in homes, to create behavioral  profiles that enable insurance companies to provide input for their risk  models.
According to NAIC, most  state insurance regulators also can use their authorities under state  statues such as an unfair trade practices act to ensure consumers are  protected (for example, to ensure that claims are paid and insurers or  brokers do not misrepresent policy terms) and to remedy other bad  conduct.
Emerging Use of  Technologies Can  Reduce Insurance  Costs and Expand  Product Choices but  Creates Privacy and  Other Challenges In recent years, the insurance industry has begun to adopt several types  of technology that are designed to provide a range of benefits to insurers  and consumers (policyholders), including improved risk monitoring,  reduced costs, and improved underwriting.
However, the use of these  technologies also can create challenges for insurers and potential risks  for consumers, including changed business models, pricing fairness, and  privacy issues.
According to stakeholders we interviewed and literature we reviewed, the  use of technology for determining insurance pricing and coverages  creates several benefits and risks for insurers and consumers:  Increased underwriting accuracy.
Stakeholders including an industry representative and a law firm in the  field indicated that insurers also might use data to exclude high-risk  consumers from marketing."
548,"Background Counting the nation’s approximately 140 million households is an  enormous undertaking requiring such essential logistics as the opening of  hundreds of area offices to conduct essential field activities, recruiting and  hiring hundreds of thousands of temporary workers to carry out those  activities, and developing an approach to training those employees.
The Bureau’s Detailed Operational Plan for the Field Infrastructure and  Decennial Logistics Management Operations also states that this  innovation to training combines multiple modes of training delivery  designed to maximize training outcomes for various types of learning  styles: visual, auditory, and hands-on, blending online training methods,  instructor-led classroom training, and on-the-job training or role-playing to  prepare field staff to effectively fulfill their duties.
The Bureau’s Efforts  to Open Area Census  Offices Appear on  Track, Despite Some  Schedule Slippages For the 2020 Census, the Bureau plans to open 248 ACOs. Similar to the  2010 Census, the total number of ACOs for 2020 was derived from the  projected workload for field operations based on the number of  enumerators needed for nonresponse follow-up.
To address this issue for Wave 2, the Bureau  stated that GSA provided additional training to the Bureau’s regional staff,  increased market outreach which included dedicated support from GSA’s  national office, and the development of a strategy to use all of GSA’s  tools, such as using GSA’s contract brokers in regions with the greatest  number of Wave 2 ACOs. Bureau regional staff also told us they were  able to meet leasing milestones in part because of flexibility in their  requirements and in the areas of consideration.
According to Bureau officials, in December of 2018, they began to  encounter a backlog of pre-employment background checks Bureau-wide  as they began hiring some 800 recruiting assistants and about 1,970  office staff for the first wave of 39 ACO openings.
According to Bureau planning documents, on the first day of  in-person classroom training, the Bureau will provide orientation  information and issue devices that trainees will use to conduct census  operations."
549,"As with other federal-aid highway programs, the Emergency Relief  Program is a partnership in which states plan and execute projects to  complete necessary repairs, and FHWA provides assistance to states in  applying for funds and conducts oversight to determine eligibility and  ensure that federal requirements are met.
In addition, out of approximately 1,200 eligible projects in Puerto  Rico, FHWA officials reported undertaking 34 more than 180 days after  the hurricanes and continuing to classify them as emergency repairs  without documenting the basis for doing so.
Appendix I: Results of GAO’s File Review of  the Emergency Relief Project Documentation  Available in Three FHWA Division Offices In 2011, we reported on how Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)  officials applied Emergency Relief Program guidance to a selected group  of projects that received funding."
550,"Upon completion of  residency training, they become eligible for higher rates of incentive pay  and, if they become board certified, for Board Certification Pay. After  fulfilling their active-duty service obligations from medical or dental school  and residency training, in addition to special and incentive pays already  received, physicians and dentists become eligible for a multi-year  retention bonus.
Cash Compensation  for Military Physicians  and Dentists Is  Generally Less Than  the Private Sector,  but DOD Provides  Substantial Deferred  and Noncash Benefits Cash compensation for active-duty military physicians and dentists was  generally less than the median compensation for private sector civilians in  calendar year 2017 for most specialties we reviewed, including at key  retention points.
Specifically, we calculated 2017 cash compensation for military medical  officers who completed their residency directly after medical school  across 21 medical specialties and found that at their first unobligated year  of service—after they fulfill their initial active-duty service obligations  accrued from medical school and military residency training—all 21  specialties had cash compensation below the private sector civilian  median.
We also calculated cash compensation for military medical officers who  (a) completed a 3-year General Medical Officer tour prior to specializing  in a residency, or (b) attended the University and accrued a 7-year active- duty service obligation and found that all but three specialties (pediatrics,  family medicine, and psychiatry) had cash compensation less than the  20th percentile for private sector civilian compensation, and all specialties  were compensated below the median.
According to military department  dental corps Chiefs, dental student graduates generally complete a 1- year advanced education in general dentistry certificate, which does not  incur a service obligation, then fulfill their dental school active-duty  service obligation as general dentists before taking a general dentist’s  retention bonus and beginning residency training.
According to DOD medical and dental corps officials, other factors that  may influence this decision include number and frequency of  deployments, ability to function at full scope of practice for training,  additional nonphysician duties and administrative requirements placed on  active-duty physicians that their private sector counterparts do not  experience, family considerations associated with permanent change of  station orders, nonselection to residency of choice, nonselection for  promotion, and retirement eligibility.
Military physicians and dentists  benefit from DOD’s scholarship program and the University, through  which prospective medical and dental students receive tuition-free  education in exchange for commitment to a number of years in active- duty service.
For example, as a result of working  group discussions, DOD officials stated that they established a new 6- year retention bonus in the fiscal year 2019 pay plan for select  medical and dental specialties, in part to ensure greater stability in the  numbers of physicians and dentists within these specialties.
(See figure 6 and appendix III for specific estimates and  confidence intervals.) Similar to the survey responses, participants in all eight focus groups with  medical residents also would not have accepted the scholarship or  attended the University under a system of consecutive active-duty service  obligations.
For our third objective, to obtain perceptions of military medical  students regarding active-duty service obligations, including their effect  on recruitment and retention, we conducted two web-based surveys with  a generalizable sample of current scholarship and University medical  students to obtain information on the students’ knowledge of the current  program and willingness to accept different lengths of service obligations  or a change to a consecutive service obligation model (see table 1)."
551,"DOD FAP serves as the policy  proponent for, and a key element of, DOD’s coordinated community  response system to prevent and respond to reports of child abuse,  domestic abuse, and problematic sexual behavior in children and youth in  military families.
DOD FAP officials stated that treatment is not  dependent on an IDC’s determination, meaning that the FAP may still  provide support services to the family even if the IDC finds that a reported  incident does not meet DOD’s criteria for abuse.
DOJ Roles and  Responsibilities in  Addressing DOD-Related  Incidents of Child Abuse The Executive Office for United States Attorneys provides general  executive assistance and supervision to the Offices of the United States  Attorneys, including evaluating their performance, making appropriate  reports and inspections, and taking corrective action when needed.
Depending on the reported incident of abuse—for example, child sexual  abuse inflicted by a servicemember parent—to get the most complete  picture of how the incident was reported, responded to, and resolved,  service officials would need to query three databases: the FAP, military  criminal investigative organization, and military justice databases.
McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019 included a provision directing DOD to establish and maintain a  centralized database on each incident of problematic sexual behavior in  children and youth reviewed by an installation FAP.
As a result, even once the centralized database on problematic sexual  behavior in children and youth is implemented, DOD will still lack a  centralized mechanism to track the reporting, response to, and resolution  of other incidents of abuse involving children that were reported to the  FAP or investigated by a military law enforcement organization— specifically, any abuse or neglect inflicted by an adult or physical abuse  inflicted by another child.
Without a centralized database that tracks all incidents of abuse involving  children that were reported to the FAP or investigated by a military law  enforcement organization, DOD and Congress will not know the extent to  which children have been affected by abuse on military installations or as  military dependents, or how such incidents have been responded to and  resolved—making it difficult to identify and address trends that could lead  to further prevention efforts.
DOD policy states that the Secretaries of the military departments  are to ensure that installation commanders or service-equivalent senior  commanders ensure that the installation FAPs immediately report any  allegations of child abuse and any criminal allegations to the appropriate  law enforcement authority.
Similarly, service guidance states that  military law enforcement is responsible for notifying the installation FAP  office of reported or suspected incidents of child abuse.
Issuing  guidance that describes the process through which the service FAPs are  to receive and incorporate information into their central registries  regarding child abuse allegations and determinations involving their  servicemembers and dependents—that also includes a mechanism to  monitor that the process is consistently occurring—would provide better  assurance that the services have complete and up-to-date information  about their personnel and their dependents, which ultimately affects their  visibility over such incidents.
The Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the Secretaries of the  military departments, should expand the scope of the department’s  centralized database on problematic sexual behavior in children and  youth, which is under development, to also track information on all  incidents involving the abuse of a child (physical, sexual, emotional, and  neglect) reported to the Family Advocacy Program or investigated by a  military law enforcement organization, regardless of whether the offender  was another child, an adult, or someone in a noncaregiving role at the  time of the incident.
(Recommendation 5) The Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the Secretaries of the  military departments, should issue guidance that describes the process  through which the service Family Advocacy Programs are to receive and  incorporate information into their central registries regarding child abuse  allegations and determinations involving their servicemembers and  dependents that were recorded by another service’s installation Family  Advocacy Program.
(Recommendation 12) The Secretary of the Army should establish efforts to comprehensively  inform victims’ families about how reported incidents of child abuse will be  addressed following the report, such as a comprehensive guide that  explains the process the Family Advocacy Program and military law  enforcement organizations will follow, and available victim services.
(Recommendation 13) The Secretary of the Navy should establish efforts to comprehensively  inform victims’ families about how reported incidents of child abuse will be  addressed following the report, such as a comprehensive guide that  explains the process the Family Advocacy Program and military law  enforcement organizations will follow, and available victim services.
(Recommendation 14) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Commandant of the  Marine Corps establishes efforts to comprehensively inform victims’  families about how reported incidents of child abuse will be addressed  following the report, such as a comprehensive guide that explains the  process the Family Advocacy Program and military law enforcement  organizations will follow, and available victim services.
(Recommendation  15) The Secretary of the Air Force should establish efforts to  comprehensively inform victims’ families about how reported incidents of  child abuse will be addressed following the report, such as a  comprehensive guide that explains the process the Family Advocacy  Program and military law enforcement organizations will follow, and  available victim services.
DOD did not concur with our first recommendation to expand the scope of  its centralized database on problematic sexual behavior in children and  youth to track information on all incidents involving the abuse of a child  reported to the FAP or investigated by a military law enforcement  organization.
To assess the extent to which DOD has visibility over reported incidents  of child abuse, including child-on-child abuse, occurring on military  installations or involving military dependents, we analyzed data from the  three primary organizations that DOD officials identified as having  responsibility for tracking these incidents: (1) the military services’ Family  Advocacy Programs (FAP), (2) the military criminal investigative  organizations, and (3) the DOD Education Activity (DODEA).
At the installations, we  interviewed FAP personnel, medical and mental health personnel, military  law enforcement officials, legal personnel, Special Assistant United  States Attorneys, military criminal investigators, chaplains, child  development center personnel, school liaison officers, military family life  counselors, DODEA personnel, and commanders about how they  prevent, track, respond to, and resolve these incidents."
552,"According to  FPDS-NG data, about 86 percent of the 121,604 set-aside contracts  awarded in that year were to small businesses with revenue or  employees at or below 25 percent of the size standard for their industry  (see fig.
We analyzed FPDS-NG and SBA data to determine the size of the  mentors participating in joint ventures under SBA’s All Small Program that  were awarded set-aside contracts in fiscal years 2016–2018.
As shown in table 4, we grouped the options into four categories: (1)  establishing a set-aside for mid-sized businesses, (2) modifying the rules  for multiple-award contracts, (3) changing how past performance is  considered when evaluating bid proposals, and (4) modifying SBA’s size  standards.
More than half of the stakeholders told us that eliminating quantitative  past performance requirements entirely also would increase contracting  opportunities for mid-sized businesses, small businesses, or both.
According to SBA officials, the  Small Business Act already requires agencies to consider the past  performance of each participant in a joint venture or team for bundled  contracts and multiple-award contracts above a certain dollar threshold.
Nearly all stakeholders said that raising revenue-based size  standards could help growing small businesses better prepare to  transition to mid-sized while remaining eligible for set-asides.
We considered a number of these  comments to be more than technical in nature and therefore, summarize  them here: SBA offered new views on three specific options for increasing federal  contracting opportunities for mid-sized businesses presented in the  report, which we incorporated where appropriate."

For example, in Ohio, state officials  said that input from community partners, such as substance use disorder  and mental health boards, helped them identify who could best provide  supportive services for job seekers in recovery.
Workforce Agencies Used  Funding to Provide  Employment Services to  Job Seekers in Recovery Officials in the four selected states that received targeted DOL grants said  they used this funding to assist those in recovery from SUD to obtain  employment.
Officials in New Hampshire and Ohio reported  using their Phase 1 and Trade and Economic Transition National  Dislocated Worker Grant funds, respectively, to pilot recovery-friendly  workplace initiatives, which provide training and supports to employers to  help them better understand and work with individuals with SUD.

According to ATF officials, ATF does not use measures to monitor  performance related to the duration of Internal Affairs investigations and  management referrals for action due to numerous factors, such as  investigators handling multiple cases at the same time and the  involvement of the DOJ OIG.
Establishing a performance  measure to monitor the timeliness of Internal Affairs and management  referrals for action could provide ATF management more complete  information in overseeing investigations and help improve the efficiency of  employee misconduct processes."
566,"TSA’s Approach to How  Risk Informs Deployment  Decisions Lacks  Documentation TSA officials told us that they operate under the assumption that every  airport is a possible entry point into the aviation system for a terrorist, and  they do not consider there to be a significant difference in vulnerability  among airports when deploying screening technologies.
Officials said many factors influenced their decision to deploy advanced  imaging technology units to category III and IV airports, including  information about threats and a related 2014 risk analysis.
TSA officials said they follow the DHS acquisition process to acquire and  deploy technologies and their deployment decisions are based on, and  informed by, their initial assessments of capability gaps, as well as their  understanding that every airport offers equal entry into the aviation  system.
(Recommendation 1) The TSA Administrator should require and ensure that TSA officials  document key decisions, including testing and analysis decisions, used to  support the development and consideration of new screening technology  explosives detection standards.
(Recommendation 3) The TSA Administrator should develop a process to ensure that  screening technologies continue to meet detection requirements after  deployment to commercial airports.

567,"Coast Guard Roles and  Processes for Managing  Shore Infrastructure According to Coast Guard guidance, the Office of Civil Engineering and  the Shore Infrastructure Logistics Center each play a role in managing the  Coast Guard’s infrastructure by assessing risks and helping to mitigate  damage from natural disasters or other events.
In 2015, the  Coast Guard’s Civil Engineering program initiated a formal assessment of  owned and occupied Coast Guard buildings to determine which were  vulnerable to 10 natural disasters, which, according to agency officials, it  aims to complete in 2025.
Although the Shore Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment Phase I  report identified multiple vulnerabilities to sixty-eight percent of the  assessed infrastructure, Coast Guard Civil Engineering program officials  told us they were unable to conclusively determine whether approximately  1,500 assessed buildings were vulnerable to hurricane winds,  earthquakes, or tornadoes—leading officials to conclude that they needed  to conduct further structural analysis.
Coast Guard officials told us that they have not used the DHS Critical  Infrastructure Risk Management Framework to guide actions to improve  the resilience of its critical infrastructure because they have instead  focused on implementing the Shore Infrastructure Vulnerability  Assessment to provide them information they intend to use to influence  resource investment decisions in the future."
568,"In addition, according to FITARA, the Office of Electronic Government at  OMB was to: Establish metrics applicable to the consolidation and optimization of  data centers (including server efficiency), ensure that information  related to agencies’ progress toward meeting government-wide data  center consolidation and optimization metrics was made available to  the public in a timely manner, review agencies’ inventories and  strategies to determine whether they were comprehensive and  complete, and monitor the implementation of each agency’s strategy.
The guidance further noted that agency progress  was to be measured by OMB on a quarterly basis, using agencies’ data  center inventory submissions and OMB-defined closures, cost savings,  and optimization targets.
OMB’s new memorandum also replaced the previous optimization metrics  with revised measures that focused on (1) reporting the number of  agencies’ virtualized hosts, underutilized servers, and data centers with  advanced energy metering; and (2) the percentage of time that data  centers were expected to be available to provide services.
Agencies Reported  Progress against  DCOI’s Revised  Optimization Metrics,  but Metrics Lacked  Appropriate  Information on  Performance  Parameters FITARA required OMB to establish metrics to measure the optimization of  data centers, including server efficiency, and to ensure that agencies’  progress toward meeting those metrics is made available to the public.
The IT  Dashboard displays agencies’ consolidation and progress information  through a DCOI Optimization Summary that displays data about the  number of agency data center facilities, achieved and planned closures,  achieved and planned IT cost savings, and progress of the current  performance metrics against the related targets.
In written comments, State did not say whether it agreed or disagreed  with our recommendation to achieve its data center-related cost  savings target established under DCOI by OMB.
Because we had previously made a number of recommendations to OMB  and the 24 DCOI agencies to help improve the reporting of data center- related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets, we did not make  new recommendations in our May 2018 report, but indicated that we  would continue to monitor the agencies’ progress toward meeting OMB’s  DCOI goals."

572,"Cadre management  officials we spoke with said that FEMA has hiring initiatives in place or  planned to help meet the staffing needs established from the review and  noted that it will take time for new staff to develop the skills and  experience to meet mission needs in the field.
FEMA’s Qualification and  Deployment Processes  Did Not Provide Reliable  Staffing Information to  Ensure Its Workforce Was  Effectively Deployed and  Used in the Field FEMA field officials in our focus groups and interviews said they  experienced a number of challenges with the reliability of information from  FEMA’s qualification and deployment processes and systems during the  2017 and 2018 disaster seasons.
Field Officials Reported  Qualification Status Was Not a  Reliable Indicator of Staff’s  Ability to Perform Their  Positions in the Field FEMA’s qualification and deployment processes and systems do not  provide accurate and complete information about staff members’ abilities  to ensure field leadership and managers get staff with the right skills at  the right time or to most effectively employ and leverage the staff that are  deployed to support FEMA’s missions.
Field Officials Cited Challenges  with Using FEMA’s  Qualification and Deployment  Processes to Fully Identify and  Use Staff Skills and  Experience Participants in our focus groups and leadership and managers in our field  and regional office interviews reported other challenges with being able to  fully identify and use staff skills and experience during disasters.
In addition, the agency has not  taken actions to address the challenges with identifying staff who can  serve multiple incident management positions and fully capturing the  qualifications of permanent full-time employees and COREs. Also,  headquarters officials stated that FEMA has revised some of its position  titles, but not all the cadres that reported challenges with overly broad  titles had adjustments made to their positions.
Given the complexity of FEMA’s workforce and the persistent issues with  the reliability of qualification designations and other challenges with  identifying the knowledge, skills, and abilities of its staff, FEMA would  benefit from developing a comprehensive plan—with timeframes and  milestones—to address issues with the quality of information its  qualification and deployment processes and systems provide to field  officials.
Developing a plan  to address the challenges that hindered FEMA’s ability to provide reliable  and complete information about staff skills to field leaders and managers  would better enable the agency to use its disaster workforce as flexibly  and effectively as possible to meet mission needs in the field.
To address all three objectives, we (1) analyzed documentation and data  on incident management workforce qualification, deployment, staffing  levels, and development; (2) conducted focus groups with members of  FEMA’s incident workforce across a range of employee types— permanent full-time employees, Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery  Employees (CORE), Incident Management CORE, reservists and local  hires; and (3) interviewed FEMA officials in headquarters and field and  regional offices."

574,"For example, one SSVF provider told us that it  is challenging to find housing for veterans with mental health or  substance use disorders; further, HVCES staff at one VAMC told us  that employment programs for the general population may not be  suitable for clients with these disorders.
According to HCHV staff at  two VAMCs, HVCES staff at three VAMCs, two PHAs that administer  the HUD-VASH voucher program, and five service providers (two  GPD, two HVRP, and one SSVF), a key challenge in addressing the  needs of homeless veterans is their resistance to participating in a  program, particularly if it places restrictions or requirements on them.
HVCES staff from one VAMC, DCHV staff from two VAMCs,  HUD-VASH staff from another VAMC, and three service providers (one  GPD and two SSVF) also told us that it is challenging to find housing and  employment for homeless veterans with legal or criminal problems and  landlords may be resistant to working with them.
Key Federal Efforts  Incorporate Many, but  Not All, Leading  Practices on  Collaboration We identified two key collaborative mechanisms that federal agencies use  to help address veteran homelessness: (1) the Solving Veterans  Homelessness as One (SVHO) working group, which coordinates VA,  HUD, and USICH’s efforts at the national level, and (2) VA’s integration  into Coordinated Entry, which seeks to ensure that homelessness  services are coordinated at the local level.
For  example, staff from three of the VAMCs we interviewed and two service  providers described communication issues related to performance  measures for four programs (HUD-VASH, GPD, HVCES, and DCHV).
Agencies Have Conducted  Some Program  Evaluations VA, HUD, and DOL published some annual reports during the last five  fiscal years that monitored the performance of some of the selected  homelessness assistance programs for veterans we reviewed.
Additionally, we  conducted semi-structured interviews with staff from local VA medical  centers (VAMCs) and service providers implementing the selected  programs we reviewed; public housing agencies (PHAs) that administer  HUD-VASH vouchers; and Continuum of Care (CoC) entities across  different locations.
Some VA medical centers (VAMCs), service providers, and public  housing agencies (PHAs) we interviewed told us the homelessness  programs for veterans we reviewed are working well."
575,"Navy officials stated  that these meetings were intended to provide information to support the  program’s Preliminary Design Review in May 2019 and mitigate risk prior  to the Navy’s release of its request for proposal in June 2019 for the  FFG(X) detail design and construction competition.
The Navy’s decision to not conduct a Milestone A review also  eliminated a formal opportunity to bring the broad set of FFG(X)  stakeholders within the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense  together at a relatively early stage to assess the program’s acquisition  strategy and affordability and feasibility, as well as technical, cost, and  schedule risks.
Navy officials stated that the plan has been  reviewed by the independent logistics assessment team members that  are evaluating the FFG(X) program’s integrated product support activities,  and noted that the Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare  Systems has separate life cycle sustainment plans for government  furnished equipment systems included in the FFG(X) design.
In addition to key cost estimating best practices that had not been  completed, the Navy had not received final design review information  from the industry teams participating in the conceptual design phase  before requesting lead ship funds from Congress.
If Congress authorizes and appropriates FFG(X) funding as the Navy  requested in March 2019, it will be critical that the Navy demonstrate the  program’s acquisition program baseline reflects the results of the  component cost position and independent cost estimate before awarding  the detail design and construction contract.
The Navy’s  planned use of existing technologies for the ship’s mission and combat  systems also supports reduced technical risk, though further maturation  of some key systems and successful integration and testing will be critical  to demonstrate the ship provides required capability within cost and  schedule expectations."
576,"While no provision of the regulations or policies governing utilities  privatization that we reviewed require DOD contracting activities to collect  data on the time to complete each phase of the pre-award process, since  2014, DLA Energy officials have attempted to maintain such data for all  the contracts for which they were the contracting agent.
In  2014, DLA Energy officials, with input from Army and Air Force utilities  privatization officials, established milestones to plan and monitor key pre- award contracting activities, including a target time to complete each  milestone.
However, despite the breadth of activities  performed and planned by DOD, the department lacks key data it needs  for further analysis and validation of the pre-award contracting process as  well as a repository for archiving lessons learned for future stakeholders  to access.
ASD(Sustainment), the military  departments, and DLA Energy officials told us that they collect  information for utilities privatization lessons learned through activities  such as data calls, working groups, workshops, studies, conferences, and  meetings.
Examples of DOD demonstrating the information analysis leading practice  include: According to DLA Energy officials, in 2014, they reviewed and  analyzed historical data from utility services contracts to revise the  utilities privatization procurement time frame.
While ASD(Sustainment), the military departments, and DLA Energy  officials stated they incorporate lessons learned in various ways, including  when they revise policies and/or operating manuals, these officials  acknowledge that they do not maintain a repository for storing and  archiving lessons learned on specific utilities privatization pre-award  contracting efforts.
Without such a capability, ASD(Sustainment), the military  departments, and DLA Energy may be missing opportunities to capture  and share lessons learned that could benefit future utilities privatization  efforts, including helping DOD achieve its goal of reducing the length of  time to contract award."
577,"As a  result, TSA issued an after action report on March 26, 2014, and  identified numerous recommendations to enhance the safety and  security of TSOs and the screening checkpoint area, such as  improving the visibility of law enforcement officers, active-shooter  training, and communications systems.
On September 24, 2015, the Gerardo Hernandez Act was enacted  into law and directed TSA to, as appropriate, conduct outreach to all  commercial airports in the United States to ensure they have plans in  place to respond to, among other things, active shooter attacks and  incidents targeting passenger screening checkpoints, and to report to  Congress on the findings from its outreach.
As a  result, the Broward County Aviation Department (BCAD) issued an  after action report on August 15, 2017, to identify coordination  challenges airport officials and law enforcement personnel  experienced in response to the active shooter incident, and  recommended preparedness and response training and exercises  among other things.
In addition to actions taken in response to the after-action report for the  LAX shooting, TSA took other actions consistent with the Gerardo  Hernandez Act. As previously mentioned, the act directed TSA to, as  appropriate, conduct outreach to all commercial airports in the United  States to ensure they have plans in place to respond to, among other  things, active shooter attacks and incidents targeting passenger  screening checkpoints, and to report to Congress on the findings from its  outreach."
578,"Federal assistance following a major  disaster declaration includes the following:  Individual Assistance: FEMA’s Individual Assistance programs provide  assistance directly to individuals and households, as well as state, local,  tribal, and territorial governments to support individual survivors.
Public Assistance: FEMA’s Public Assistance program provides  supplemental federal disaster grant assistance to state, local, tribal, and  territorial governments and certain types of private nonprofit organizations  for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the restoration  of disaster-damaged, publicly-owned facilities and the facilities of certain  private nonprofit organizations.
As previously discussed, although states and other federal agencies have  primary responsibility for fire suppression, some state and local fire  suppression costs are eligible for reimbursement through FMAGs. Most  wildfire-affected states and localities in our scope received this kind of fire  suppression support from FEMA initially in the form of the FMAGs. As the  fires ultimately led to major disaster declarations, any funding that FEMA  would have provided through the FMAGs were ultimately provided under  Public Assistance as part of the declaration.
To support state-led response and provide for the immediate needs of  displaced survivors, FEMA deployed staff to assist in state Emergency  Operations Centers and secured needed resources for mass care—such  as cots to help with temporary sheltering, according to state officials.
As response activities continued and recovery began, FEMA and the  state emergency management agencies established Joint Field Offices,  which are temporary field offices established to coordinate federal and  state efforts in disaster response and recovery, and provided resources to  help individual disaster survivors with community services and housing  needs."
579,"In particular, Interior regulations and BIE  procedures require that BIE annually verify that all students with an  IEP in the BIE system are provided with special education services in  accordance with their IEPs. BIE’s Division of Performance and Accountability (DPA) is primarily  responsible for overseeing Education-funded programs at BIE  schools, including IDEA and Title I, Part A of the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended.
Specifically, in May 2018, BIE  established a new policy and guidance for conducting annual  targeted, risk-based monitoring of BIE school programs, which is  separate from the requirements for the agency to verify the provision  of special education and related services annually.
BIE’s policy requires that staff from five of its divisions—DPA,  School Operations, and the three school divisions responsible for  directly supporting BIE schools—coordinate and conduct joint  monitoring activities as teams, including a review of schools’ special  education programs.
IDEA requires that schools provide special education and related services  to eligible students as outlined in their IEPs. However, because BIE  schools follow inconsistent practices for whether to make up services  when missed, and BIE has not established consistent requirements in this  area, there is a risk that some schools may not be providing services in  accordance with students’ IEPs. As noted previously, we found that  schools did not provide or did not document almost an estimated 40  percent of students’ service time, based on our review of service logs.
Difficulties in Identifying  Special Education  Providers, Especially in  Remote Areas, Limited  Some Schools’ Ability to  Provide Services to  Students Officials at 22 of the 30 schools in our sample provided us with  information in addition to their service logs, and all 22 schools reported  difficulties in recruiting, hiring, or retaining staff or contractors with the  required qualifications to provide special education and related services,  which some said limited their ability to provide students with high quality  required services.
Finally, BIE must take steps to  make sure its offices annually review school documentation to verify that  students are receiving special education and related services and provide  high-risk schools selected for targeted monitoring with timely reports and  technical assistance plans."
580,"Private laboratories usually collect and analyze  the samples used as evidence to indicate that a commercial shipment  does not violate FFDCA and provide support for FDA’s decisions to  remove firms and products from import alerts.
According to FDA officials, when the agency relies on  documentation to support a removal decision, FDA generally relies on  subsequent inspections of the importers or foreign processing facilities  and sampling of their products to have confidence that the firms and their  products continue to comply.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following three recommendations to FDA: The Commissioner of FDA should establish a process to monitor  whether the agency is meeting its audit goals and expectations for  sampling and inspections to support its removal decisions for seafood  import alerts.
More specifically, FDA agreed with our recommendation that it establish a  process to monitor whether the agency is meeting its audit goals and  expectations for sampling and inspections to support its removal  decisions for seafood import alerts."
581,"DOD Implements  Acquisition-Related NDAA  Provisions in DFARS and  by Other Methods DOD’s acquisition rulemaking procedures are governed by statute, which  generally requires agencies to issue a proposed rule for each rulemaking  and provide not less than a 30-day public comment period following  publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.
DARS staff can implement the provisions by one or more methods,  including the rulemaking process described above and other actions,  such as:  issuing DFARS class deviations, and  changing DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI), a  non-regulatory document that supplements the DFARS.
To identify the implementation status of acquisition-related NDAA  provisions from fiscal years 2010-2018, we further analyzed data from the  Defense Acquisition Regulations Management Information System and  DARS reports."
582,"In  2015, DOL and DHS jointly issued regulations that set forth a number of  specific requirements that employers must meet in order to obtain a  TLC, including taking specific steps to recruit U.S. workers before hiring  H-2B workers; paying a wage equal to or exceeding the highest of the  prevailing wage or the federal, state, or local minimum wage; paying for  H-2B workers’ transportation costs; and guaranteeing a minimum number  of work hours to H-2B workers.
Additionally, during fiscal years  2017, 2018 and 2019, Congress enacted provisions that authorized DHS,  after consultation with DOL, to make more visas available beyond the  statutory cap of 66,000 if the agencies determined that the needs of U.S.
According to  our questionnaire responses, three of the 15 employers who did not  receive all requested H-2B visas under the standard cap in fiscal year  2018 reported having to lay off or reduce hours of U.S. workers.
In  addition, among the three construction employers who responded to our  questionnaire and did not receive all requested H-2B visas under the  standard cap, two reported increased supply purchases during fiscal year  2018.
In each of the  three years, federal law authorized DHS after consultation with DOL to  provide additional H-2B visas beyond the standard cap if the needs of  U.S. businesses could not be met with U.S. workers, up to the maximum  number of H-2B returning workers in any prior year when the returning  worker exemption was in effect (about 65,000 in 2007, according to the  agencies).
The agencies said in the 2018 and 2019 temporary rules making  additional visas available that they did not have enough time remaining in  those fiscal years to conduct a more formal analysis of the adverse  effects on U.S. workers that may result from a broader cap  increase.Assessing the advantages and disadvantages of considering  current economic trends in addition to past demand would help the agencies decide if such an approach would be a better way to estimate  employer need in any future years when Congress authorizes visas  beyond the H-2B standard cap.
According to DHS and DOL, the agencies have also sought to balance  employers’ hiring needs and the interests of U.S. workers by setting a  higher standard that employers must meet to qualify for additional H-2B  visas.
DOL  officials told us the agency reviews the original TLC application and  requests additional documentation of the employer’s activities when  conducting audits to determine whether the employer is in compliance  with program requirements."
583,"NNSA and CNS officials responsible for the Cost Savings  Program collaborate regularly via biweekly meetings and tri-annual  reviews to monitor CNS’s progress on cost reduction initiatives  throughout the fiscal year.
These reports detail the performance of the M&O contractor and  progress made against proposed cost savings targets, and list the  amount of savings CNS is claiming to have achieved in that fiscal year, to  include both annual new savings and savings sustained from prior years.
Of the $170 million in NNSA-verified annual new savings for fiscal  years 2014 through 2018, roughly 10 percent (approximately $17 million)  is attributed to the merging of the Y-12 and Pantex sites into a  consolidated management structure, according to CNS and NNSA  documentation.
NNSA documents we examined showed that CNS, the government, and  site reinvestment projects received a certain share of the $515 million in  cumulative contract savings that NNSA verified from fiscal year 2014  through fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Additionally, in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, CNS reported estimates for its  total execution costs rather than tracking the actual execution costs for  each individual cost reduction initiative, which NNSA officials said made it  difficult to verify net savings.
Although NNSA has identified site reinvestment projects as  one of the key benefits of the Cost Savings Program, NNSA and CNS  have not committed approximately $13 million of site reinvestment funds  available at Y-12 and Pantex, in part because they have not evaluated  and developed a plan on how best to aggregate and use the funds."
584,"For example, DOD sponsors must provide the  Laboratories and Personnel Office quarterly updates on a project’s  progress obtaining data and, once the project is complete, information on  the results of its access to sensitive data under the pilot program.
According to  FFRDC representatives and an Air Force official involved in the work,  the pilot program facilitated the FFRDC’s access to sensitive data  held by the Defense Contract Management Agency that researchers  used to identify early indicators of contractor performance risks.
(Recommendation 1) The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering should  direct the Laboratories and Personnel Office to take steps to ensure that  the FFRDCs and sponsors are implementing the pilot program’s  protections for sensitive data."
585,"For example, the increased lifespan of the $1 note  relative to that of the $1 coin and the decreased cost to the Federal  Reserve for processing currency are key factors in these estimates and  substantially reduced the relative costs of the status quo scenario.
Changing the  metal composition of circulating coins could help the Mint achieve more  effective and efficient operations by reducing production costs, resulting  in savings to the government and the taxpayer.
The various assumptions include the extent to which the public would  increase its holdings of cash when coins are used instead of notes, the  expected rate of growth in the demand for currency over 30 years, the  costs of producing and processing both coins and notes, and the life span  of both forms of currency (see table 3).
Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report: (1) determines the estimated net benefit to the government, if  any, of replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin and selected stakeholders’  views on this change, and (2) examines what is known about potential  cost savings to the government from suspending production of the penny  and changing the metal composition of the nickel coin as well as selected  stakeholders’ views on these changes.
To estimate the net benefit or loss to the government of replacing the $1  note with a $1 coin, we conducted economic simulations under different  scenarios and assumptions over a 30-year period."
586,"During ODNI’s management of the program from 2005 through 2011,  ODNI established general goals and oversaw the program’s  implementation by defining and collecting performance measures on a  range of IC CAE activities and working with a contractor to summarize  this information in annual reports.
For  example, the 2014 grant announcement listed eight program components  a college’s proposal would be evaluated on, to include study abroad  opportunities and annual colloquium or speaker series on intelligence and  national security issues, along with other requirements such as cost  program management and sustainment plans.
While DIA continued  the program’s mission to increase the pool of diverse applicants for the  IC, it lacked results-oriented goals, an overall strategy for the program, an  evaluation of external factors, performance measures, and a plan to  assess the program’s performance in order to determine the  appropriateness of the goals and effectiveness of implemented strategies.
DIA’s annual reports  describe the program’s mission as developing national security and  intelligence education programs in order to increase the pool of culturally,  geographically, and ethnically diverse, multidisciplinary job applicants  who possess highly desired skills and competencies in areas of critical  need to the IC.
Current DIA internal guidance states that the IC CAE program office  carries out the program’s mission by providing grants to colleges to  support the establishment of intelligence-centric curricula.
For example, DIA has not evaluated  whether some colleges’ difficulty with sustaining their IC CAE program  may invalidate underlying assumptions about how the program is  structured, including whether awarding grants to colleges to develop and  maintain an intelligence-focused curriculum is the most effective means of  establishing long-term relationships with those colleges and fostering a  diverse talent pool for the IC.
For example,  between 2011 and 2016, DIA officials stated colleges provided DIA a  spreadsheet of information on IC CAE program activities, including  descriptions of IC CAE courses and events, study abroad program  participation, IC element interaction, and information about individual IC  CAE scholars.
According to DIA officials, DIA is  currently developing a plan that would require colleges to report  information in order to maintain their IC CAE designation after the grant  period ends."
587,"Specifically, GSA requires agencies to include either a complete street  address or geo-coordinates for all 398,000 assets in the FRPP; for  example, GSA’s FRPP data dictionary establishes the format agencies  are to use when inputting asset addresses—number, street, city, zip  code.
Figure 3 illustrates how  such information flagged as being questionable, is actually correct  according to GSA’s reporting rules for agencies, which specify data  categories, such as the types of buildings GSA considers to be  warehouses.
ISC also recommended  that agencies use internal guidance on restricting the public release of  real property information and ISC’s mission criticality criteria to  determine any individual real property assets to withhold entirely from the  public database.
Agencies Withheld  Publicly Available  Information and Withheld  Similar Assets  Inconsistently, Making  Analysis Difficult While GSA withheld the 15 categories of data across all agencies, it  allowed each agency to determine if any specific assets should be  withheld entirely from the public database, in accordance with ISC’s  second recommendation.
(Recommendation 3) The Administrator of GSA should instruct each agency to apply a  consistent, risk-based approach in determining which, if any, assets or  asset-specific information should be withheld from public release."
588,"Federal law and CMS policy define specific time  frames for nursing home staff and state survey agencies to report  incidents of abuse that occur in nursing homes, respectively, and  CMS requires states to establish their own reporting time frames  for assisted living facilities serving HCBS waiver participants.
Appendix II: Summary of Selected Federal and State  Audits of Oversight of the Reporting, Investigation, and  Notification of Law Enforcement about Elder Abuse in  Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities GAO has issued reports reviewing the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services’ (CMS) oversight of the health and welfare of residents in  nursing homes and assisted living facilities."
589,"To achieve interoperability, railroads have to complete a series of steps  including (1) additional installation work (such as installing equipment on  a tenant railroad’s locomotives) and scheduling (such as coordinating with  the relevant railroad to reach any needed agreements and identify dates  for testing), (2) laboratory testing, (3) field testing, and (4) RSD or  revenue service operations.
Representatives from several railroads and FRA specialists we  interviewed said that software issues routinely arise in lab testing, field  testing, and RSD that require vendor revisions before a railroad’s PTC  implementation can continue.
Representatives  from this railroad also noted that resolving software issues is often not  entirely within a railroad’s control due to the need for vendor support, in  contrast to some earlier challenges leading up to the 2018 deadline,  where, for example, the railroad itself had more control as it was installing  equipment and could more clearly track progress."
590,"According to an Air Force Policy Directive in place at the time of contract  award, programs that are based on commercial derivative aircraft are  required to achieve Federal Aviation Administration certification to the  maximum extent practical.
The Air Force awarded Boeing a fixed-price incentive (firm target)  contract to develop the KC-46, which includes the design, manufacture,  and delivery of four test aircraft.
The estimates include, among other things, the  expected costs of the development and procurement contracts awarded  to Boeing, government test and evaluation costs, program office  expenses for advisory and assistance services from support contractors,  as well as contingency funding that might be needed to address the  potential risk of requirements changes or other unexpected issues.
Specifically, program officials  anticipate that the Air Force will accept the first 18 aircraft by August  2019, and nine sets of wing aerial refueling pods by June 2020—which  together with two spare engines constitute the contractual delivery  requirement contained in the development contract.
According to program  officials, Boeing continued to have difficulty providing design  documentation needed to start Federal Aviation Administration testing for  the wing aerial refueling pods over the past year, which caused the  additional delays beyond what we reported last year.
Additional Test and  Analysis Required to  Validate That KC-46  Aircraft Fully Meet  Key Contract and  Mission  Requirements Over the next year, Boeing is to conduct developmental testing on the  wing aerial refueling pods and correct deficiencies, and the Air Force is to  finish analyzing test data to validate that performance and contract  specifications have been met.
Since our last report in  April 2018, Boeing completed developmental testing and obtained  airworthiness certification from the Federal Aviation Administration for the  KC-46 aircraft and two of its three aerial refueling systems—the boom  and the centerline drogue system."
591,"The largest share of federal support comes from FCC’s Universal Service  Fund, which includes four component programs designed to ensure  access to affordable communications for schools, libraries, rural health  care providers, low-income consumers, and those in rural and high-cost  areas.
In 2018, we  reviewed data that FCC collected from providers to describe the  locations of existing broadband infrastructure and help federal  programs identify unserved and underserved areas to target for  federal funding.
Industry and Federal  Investments Have  Reduced Broadband  Deployment Gaps  and Improved How  Progress Is  Measured, Although  Some Challenges  Persist Industry Invested Billions  of Dollars in Broadband According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Capital Expenditures  Survey data, the telecommunications industry that provides various types  of broadband services—fixed, mobile, or satellite (and other)—spent an  estimated $795 billion (2018 dollars) in total capital expenditures from  2009 through 2017.
Deployment  data submitted by providers that receive support from FCC’s high-cost  program showed that they used those funds to make broadband  available to about 2.3-million new residential and small business  locations, mostly from 2015 through 2017.
Under these rules, FCC  established new funding streams within the high-cost program, such as  the Connect America Fund, which addresses fixed broadband availability  gaps in underserved and unserved areas, and the Mobility Fund, which  supports deployment of wireless networks to provide mobile broadband."
592,"For example, officials at the Vermont Service Center stated that VAWA  self-petition unit adjudicators and CFDO immigration officers collaborate  and share information to combat potential fraud through activities that  include monthly meetings, regular contact through their co-location, and  an electronic bulletin board.
Within the  Vermont Service Center, CFDO officials stated the CFDO unit consists of  three immigration officers and a supervisory immigration officer who have  defined antifraud responsibilities, such as conducting administrative  investigations of self-petition filings that are referred by adjudicators who  suspect fraudulent activity.
USCIS  officials we spoke with acknowledged the benefits of conducting a fraud  risk assessment and noted that a formal analysis of self-petition fraud  referrals and administrative investigations could help to better understand  the extent of fraud risks that exist in the self-petition program.
USCIS’s  specific fraud control activities include, for example, the Vermont Service  Center Background Check Unit conducting TECS checks on foreign  nationals who submit self-petitions during the pre-adjudication stage to  determine whether the self-petitioner is connected to any administrative  or criminal investigations, is the subject of a national security concern, or  is a public safety threat.
According to USCIS officials, the agency has developed and uses data  analytics capabilities as part of its efforts to identify and prevent fraud  within immigration benefit programs.
For example, as  previously discussed, while adjudicating self-petitions, USCIS officers  may request additional evidence from petitioners for reasons including  incomplete or inconsistent information provided in filings, or suspected  fraud, USCIS officials told us."
593,"Within the Research, Education and Economics mission area, NIFA  national officials oversee EFNEP, in part by providing program guidance,  reviewing grant recipient plans, and conducting some monitoring and  oversight of local implementing entities.
USDA Collects  Information on  Nutrition Education  Participation and  Expenditures, but  Faces Challenges  Assessing  Effectiveness for One  of Its Largest  Programs Information on  Participation Includes  Those Receiving Direct  Education and Other  Measures of Program  Reach According to USDA data, 3.8 million and 436,000 people participated in  direct education interventions for SNAP-Ed and EFNEP, respectively, in  fiscal year 2018.
For example, USDA officials said direct  education has been less of a focus in SNAP-Ed in recent years, as the  department has encouraged programs to use policy, systems, and  environmental change interventions and social marketing, in addition to  the traditional direct education, following implementation of the Healthy  Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.
Regional officials and land-grant university officials said that more formal  coordination mechanisms to provide leadership and promote cross- department coordination and information sharing on nutrition education  could help increase efficiency, maximize the use of federal resources,  and avoid potential duplication of effort."
594,"USPS officials  told us they determine where to offer nonpostal products and services  based on several factors, such as customer demand and analysis of the  potential to generate revenue.
Stakeholders Reported  Non-Revenue Benefits  and Few Challenges  Related to Current  Nonpostal Products and  Services Offered USPS officials, federal government entities, and stakeholders we  interviewed and postmasters we surveyed told us that the identified  nonpostal products and services (as shown in table 2) currently offered at  retail facilities provided the following non-revenue benefits.
Representatives of one postal employee union, postmasters we  surveyed, and officials from the six federal government entities that had  partnered with USPS reported minimal challenges related to providing the  identified nonpostal products and services at retail facilities.
USPS officials, stakeholders, and studies we reviewed indicated these  identified additional nonpostal activities—if USPS were authorized to offer  them—could offer a variety of non-revenue benefits to consumers,  government entities, and communities.
On the one hand, USPS  officials, officials from other federal government entities, postmasters we  surveyed, and stakeholders generally said that there was little demand for  many of the additional nonpostal products and services USPS could offer  at its facilities."
595,"The  memorandum was intended to improve the way federal agencies buy,  build, and deliver information technology and software, and required that  all agencies establish a pilot program under which at least 20 percent of  new custom-developed code would be released as OSS for 3 years.
DOD Has Not Fully  Implemented an  Open Source  Software Pilot  Program and Related  OMB Requirements DOD was mandated by law to initiate the OSS pilot program established  by OMB memorandum M-16-21 which required (1) releasing at least 20  percent of newly custom-developed code each year for the term of the  pilot program, and (2) collecting additional data concerning new custom  software to inform measures to gauge the performance of the pilot  program.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology Our objectives were to: (1) assess the extent to which the Department of  Defense (DOD) has implemented the open source software (OSS) pilot  program and other related requirements established by the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), and (2) describe the views of  responsible DOD officials on the use of OSS to achieve efficiency at the  department."
596,"In 2015, in response to the DHS Office of Inspector General covert test  findings that highlighted areas of concern in the passenger screening  process, TSA implemented a TSO re-training effort, beginning with a  nationwide training called “Mission Essentials—Threat Mitigation.”  According to TSA, this training provided the opportunity for the TSO  workforce to become familiar with the threat information that underlies  TSA’s use of checkpoint technologies and operational procedures to  mitigate risks.
While TSA has guidance outlining roles and responsibilities for training  oversight at a high level, TSA headquarters and field officials told us their  processes for monitoring training compliance—including analyzing  training compliance data, reporting their results, and taking action to address the results—were not documented."
597,"These best practices include: training staff on trust and  treaty rights; providing clear information on proposals in a consistent and  timely manner; holding consultations on lands convenient to tribes when  possible; compensating tribes for consultant-like advice; and working to  build strong, ongoing dialogue between tribal authorities and agency  decision makers, among others."
598,"Specifically, the plan states that DOD will identify policy gaps and  revise or develop policy at all levels to better oversee prepositioned  stocks; assigns the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  and the services to review and revise the current prepositioning  policies as appropriate; and tasks the geographic combatant  commanders to ensure that theater campaign plans provide clear  guidance for service prepositioned stock planning.
The plan also states  that DOD will use a governance body composed of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the geographic combatant  commanders; and the services to provide joint oversight of the  prepositioned stock programs."
599,"Allows authorized federal, state,  territorial, tribal, and local government agencies to send text-like  messages to mobile devices in geographically selected areas  as  one-way cellular broadcasts.
According to  FEMA policy, state, territorial, tribal, and local government agencies  first complete FEMA’s application process to gain access to IPAWS  and obtain the proper authorization to issue alerts for specific  geographic jurisdictions.
An academic we interviewed said it is important to note that local alerting  authorities use the NWS warnings to issue alerts instructing the public to  take specific protective actions, for example, to evacuate using certain  roads.
As discussed  earlier, a state/local WEA test option was also required to allow  alerting authorities to send test messages to a subset of the public  without prior approval from FCC.
FCC officials said they have no plans to test other new WEA  capabilities, including the expanded message length, and that at the  time of our review it was too early to say how results from the  partnered tests would be analyzed and shared more broadly with  public-safety stakeholders.
FEMA Provides Training  and Resources but Lacks  Documented Next Steps  to Address Authorities’  Challenges The IPAWS Modernization Act requires FEMA to instruct and educate  federal, state, tribal, and local government officials in the use of IPAWS.
In addition, for both objectives,  we interviewed officials from FEMA, FCC, NOAA, USGS, and 18 state,  local and territorial alerting authorities; representatives from 4 industry  associations, 2 advocacy groups, and 15 companies, including wireless  carriers, internet service providers, internet content providers, IPAWS  software providers, and mobile device manufacturers; and 7 academics."

601,"These eight quality  measurement strategic objectives are for CMS to adopt measures that are patient-centered and meaningful to patients, clinicians, and address high-impact measure areas that safeguard public health, are outcome-based where possible,  fulfill each program’s statutory requirements, minimize burden for providers,  create significant opportunity for improvement, address measure needs for population-based payment through  alternative payment models, and align across programs and/or with other payers.
CMS Lacks Complete  Information on Its  Quality Measurement  Funding and on How  It Uses Funding to  Achieve Its Strategic  Objectives CMS maintains information in its core budget database on the amount of  funding for its quality measurement activities, such as when funding for  that purpose is specifically authorized by appropriations.
In addition, the documents that CMS uses to plan and monitor spending  for quality measurement activities generally do not include information  showing how much funding CMS has obligated for activities related to  CMS’s quality measurement strategic objectives.
CMS officials told us that they assess the impact of the agency’s quality  measurement activities by reviewing changes over time in health care  providers’ reported performance on selected quality measures."
602,"The  contractor said they spent a considerable amount of time completing their  annual report, which totaled over 60 pages and included information and  signatures from over 40 different Indian Education Committees that  oversee local JOM programs funded by the contract.
By identifying staff who have the capacity to carry out  oversight activities and clearly defining related responsibilities such as  conducting site visits and reviewing JOM annual reports, BIE could  provide support to contractors in improving their program activities  and procedures and reduce the risk of potential fraud and abuse of  JOM funds.
(Recommendation 4) The Director of the Bureau of Indian Education should clearly define the  roles and responsibilities and identify the staff necessary for conducting  critical JOM functions, including administering contracts, reviewing the  appropriateness of contract types, and overseeing those contractors that  are subject to BIE oversight."
603,"In September 2015, the Secretary of Defense and the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff signed the DC3I in an effort to  transform DOD cybersecurity culture by enabling and reshaping  leaders, cyber providers, personnel who perform cyberspace  operations, and general users to improve individual human  performance and accountability on DOD’s network.
FISMA requires DOD to develop,  document, and implement a program to provide security for  information and information systems (commonly referred to as a  cybersecurity program) and directs the Secretary of Defense to  delegate to the DOD CIO (and military department CIOs) authority to  ensure compliance with the law.
If the Deputy Secretary of Defense does not identify a DOD component to  oversee the implementation of the seven CDIP tasks that DOD CIO does  not oversee and report on progress implementing them, the department  will have less assurance that cybersecurity vulnerabilities are being  addressed in a timely manner and systems are being securely configured.
Selected DOD components did not know the extent to which their network  users implemented the 2018 Cyber Awareness Challenge training by  completing it because the DOD component heads did not ensure that  their respective components were accurately monitoring and reporting the  necessary information.
In addition,  neither of these recurring reports identifies key cyberattack techniques  the department faces nor do they include information on the extent that  the department has implemented cyber hygiene practices to protect DOD  networks from these techniques, according to DOD officials.
As one of two recurring reports sent to senior DOD  leaders, the Cyber Hygiene Scorecard may be well positioned to provide  additional information reflecting progress made implementing cyber  hygiene initiatives and associated cybersecurity practices, including the  DC3I and efforts to protect DOD networks from the key cyberattack  techniques used by adversaries.
(Recommendation 3) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that DOD components  accurately monitor and report information on the extent that users have  completed the Cyber Awareness Challenge training as well as the  number of users whose access to the network was revoked because they  have not completed the training."
604,"Few Adults Used  Obesity Drugs and  Limited Data Are  Available on  Individuals Who Have  Used These Drugs Relatively few U.S. adults, including adults with obesity and adults who  reported trying to lose weight, used obesity drugs from 2012 through  2016, according to nationally representative estimates.
For private health insurance—which includes employer- sponsored health insurance, individually purchased health plans, and  FEHBP plans—we found that coverage varied and, when obesity drugs  were covered, the coverage could have additional requirements such as  prior authorization or determination that a drug is medically necessary for  the patient.
(See table 3 for 2016 and 2017 data.) Medicaid  managed care organizations may provide coverage of obesity drugs not  covered by the state plan, according to CMS.
Two-Thirds of Obesity  Drug Payments Were Paid  Out of Pocket by Patients;  Phentermine Was Most  Purchased Out-of-pocket payments made up about two-thirds of total amounts paid  for obesity drugs for U.S. adults and private health insurance paid a  quarter, according to AHRQ’s nationally representative estimates from  MEPS data for 2012 through 2016.
Interviews with Officials in  Stakeholder  Organizations, Federal  Agencies, Insurers, and  Others We obtained information and reviewed studies from officials from eight  stakeholder organizations (representing medical associations and  advocacy groups for obesity research and treatment) on the use of  obesity drugs and guidelines for using obesity drugs and to obtain their  perspectives on what physicians and other health care providers take into  consideration when prescribing these drugs, among other things."
605,"The majority of FEMA’s obligations  and the funding the USVI expended as of October 1, 2018, are for  emergency work because these projects began soon after the disasters  struck and focused on debris removal and providing assistance to  address immediate threats to life and property.
These permanent work projects include about  $349.4 million for cost-effective hazard mitigation measures aimed at  reducing the future risk of disaster-damaged facilities in conjunction with  their repair."
606,"Several of the  Selected Agencies  Have Taken Steps to  Better Ensure the  Effectiveness of Their  Remote Identity  Proofing Processes,  but Only Two Have  Eliminated the Use of  Knowledge-Based  Verification As previously discussed, in 2017, NIST released an updated version of its  technical guidance on remote identity proofing.
Department of Veterans  Affairs Has Implemented  Some Alternative  Methods, but Has No  Plans to Reduce or  Eliminate its Remaining  Use of Knowledge-Based  Verification VA has taken steps to better ensure the effectiveness of its remote  identity proofing processes, but it continues to rely on knowledge-based  verification for certain categories of individuals.
United States Postal  Service Intends to  Eliminate Its Use of  Knowledge-Based  Verification, but Does Not  Yet Have Complete Plans  and Time frames for Doing  So USPS has not yet fully implemented alternative methods to better ensure  the effectiveness of its remote identity proofing processes.
Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services Has No  Plans to Reduce or  Eliminate its Use of  Knowledge-Based  Verification CMS has not implemented alternative methods to better ensure the  effectiveness of the remote identity proofing processes used for its  Healthcare.gov service.
As previously discussed, NIST’s guidance effectively  prohibits the use of knowledge-based verification during the validation  and verification phases of the remote identity proofing process, but does  not provide direction to agencies on how to successfully implement  alternative methods for remote identity proofing for large and diverse  segments of the population.
Officials from CMS, SSA, and USPS stated that they have not eliminated  their use of knowledge-based verification in part because the existing  NIST technical guidance does not provide direction on how alternative  methods are to be implemented, given the various limitations of those  alternative methods that agencies have identified."
607,"Enacted in 1935, Social Security provides for the general  welfare of older Americans by, among other things, establishing a system  of federal old-age benefits, including a retirement program.
About 40 years after the creation of Social Security, landmark legislation  was enacted in 1974 that has played a major role in establishing the  structure for private sector employers’ involvement in sponsoring  retirement plans for their workers: the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
For example,  ERISA establishes certain requirements for all employer-sponsored  plans, including responsibilities for plan fiduciaries (those who manage  and control plan assets, among others), as well as minimum funding  standards for defined benefit (DB) plans, which traditionally promise to  provide a monthly payment to retirees for life.
For those  who lack sufficient personal savings or other assets to augment their  Social Security benefit or income from any employer-sponsored plan, the  only option to maintain a desired standard of living may be to continue  working past age 65.
Other recommendations included federal protections for participants in  state and local government plans, more consistent tax treatment of  pension plans and retirement savings vehicles, provisions to strengthen  Social Security, as well as proposals regarding employment of older  workers and disability programs.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)  Selected provisions: Regulated private sector employers who offer pension or welfare benefit plans for their employees.
Social Security Amendments of 1983  Selected provisions: Gradually raised the normal retirement age from 65 to 67, depending on an individuals’ year of  birth; expanded coverage; increased the self-employment tax for self-employed persons; subjected a portion of Social  Security benefits to federal income tax for the first time; and changed how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated  when trust funds are low."
608,"FHA requires servicers to preserve and protect the property and  ensure it meets FHA’s conveyance condition standards before conveying  title.
The compliance contractor  reviews property inspections to ensure properties meet conveyance  condition standards, reviews requests from servicers for extensions of  conveyance times or for overallowable expenses, reviews servicer  claims for compliance with requirements, and responds to servicer  inquiries about pre- and postconveyance responsibilities.
Officials in each HOC are responsible for  overseeing the maintenance and marketing contractors for their  region and reviewing HUD Property Inspection Reports to determine if  conveyed properties should be reconveyed to the servicer due to  condition issues.
FHA’s Property  Conveyance Process  Often Takes a Long  Time, and Servicers  and Contractors  Performance against  Time Requirements  Varied Conveyance Times  Increased after 2011,  Partly Due to Greater Use  of Other Disposition  Methods and Extended  Default and Foreclosure  Periods Data on Time Frames for  Conveyance and  Reconveyance From July 2010 through December 2017, the property conveyance  process took a median of 70 days, but this figure varied widely by year.
In  comparison, FHA officials said the conveyance process generally should  take about 37 days to complete—30 days for servicers to make  necessary repairs and convey title to FHA and 7 days for FHA to inspect  the property, communicate any condition issues identified during the  inspection, and assign a marketing contractor to promote and sell it.
The servicer then must complete any required repairs, resolve  any title issues, prepare a new evidence package for FHA showing that  condition and title issues were addressed, and submit a request to FHA’s  compliance contractor to convey the property again.
According to FHA and servicer representatives, damaged properties can  take longer to convey because they require extensive repairs to meet  FHA’s conveyance condition standards.
In addition, representatives from six of the 20 servicers we interviewed  said FHA’s process for reviewing servicers’ overallowable requests  (additional funds needed to complete work) negatively affected their  ability to convey properties in 30 days."
609,"For example, the November 2018 guide  states the following: An agreements officer should consider whether a company is  supplying a new key technology, providing a material increase in the  performance of a product, or making some other contribution when  determining if a non-traditional company or non-profit research  institution will be participating to a significant extent.
As stated earlier,  according to statute, traditional defense contractors can be awarded  prototype other transactions under three possible conditions: by  partnering with at least one non-traditional defense contractor or non- profit research institution participating to a significant extent, paying at  least one-third of the total project cost, or having the government  agency’s senior procurement executive determine in writing that  exceptional circumstances justify the use of a prototype other transaction.
FPDS-NG also shows that, as of March 2019, the Army  had obligated $116 million as modifications under the base  transaction, and, according to the Army Contracting Command-New  Jersey agreements officer, were for consortium members to carry out  various prototype projects."

611,"The Bureau’s Design and  Implementation of LUCA  Address Validation Led to  Additional Fieldwork Fieldwork in other 2020 Census operations increased as a result of (1)  LUCA’s original operational design, and (2) subsequent implementation  decisions the Bureau made in response to receiving a larger number of  address updates than it expected from participants.
Our review of Bureau documents and evaluations—along with interviews  of Bureau officials, subject matter specialists, and state-level LUCA  participant stakeholders—identified several issues for the Bureau to  resolve with stakeholders, Congress, and other federal agencies as part  of the planning process for the 2030 Census: Assessing whether LUCA should continue to have a role in  building the address list.
By realigning the  schedule of LUCA where appropriate, the Bureau could give tribal, state,  and local governments more time to review the address list in their areas  and thus more time to provide quality updates to the Bureau.
(Recommendation 6) The Secretary of Commerce should ensure that the Director of the  Census Bureau uses the Bureau’s data on hard-to-count areas to inform  geographic activities such as: targeting LUCA outreach to tribal, state,  and local governments; planning additional rounds of in-office address  canvassing; and providing feedback to tribal, state, and local  governments on gaps in their respective address data."
612,"Although Caregiver Support Program Office officials said that they are  taking steps to collect more information about the staff involved in  supporting the Family Caregiver Program to prepare for the MISSION Act  expansion, these efforts do not fully address the problems with data  completeness and accuracy that we identified.
Specifically, the program plans to collect information on  Caregiver Support Program Office funded staff at each VAMC from the  VISN lead officials quarterly instead of annually, to align with how other  national programs collect such data.
According to program  officials, this release is expected to include expanded capabilities needed  to develop system-wide reports on the completion of the required  quarterly contacts and annual home visits.
(Recommendation 2) Identify and use an interim method to collect data from VAMCs on  their completion of required quarterly contacts and annual home visits  with caregivers and veterans that can be used until a new IT system is  implemented."
613,"Under  these subprograms, IAEA carries out a wide range of nuclear security  activities, including developing and promoting the use of nuclear security  guidance documents, providing assistance to member states, and  developing training programs.
DNS works with  member states that request an INSSP to develop implementation  strategies, based on the nuclear security needs identified, for IAEA or  potential donors to provide assistance to the state.
IAEA’s Performance  Measures Have  Limitations, and Agency  Reports on Nuclear  Security Do Not  Consistently Include  Performance Information IAEA has established several performance measures for its nuclear  security program and subprograms, but these measures do not fully align  with leading practices.
However, many of the performance measures for the  nuclear security program and subprograms are focused on activities the  agency carries out, for which DNS can develop targets and baselines;  they are not focused on activities of member states.
Disagreements over the  Agency’s Role Create  Challenges by Reinforcing  DNS’s Reliance on Extra- budgetary Contributions IAEA officials and others we interviewed said that the disagreements over  the agency’s nuclear security role create tangible challenges for the  agency concerning funding, as member states that do not support the  agency’s nuclear security role resist efforts to substantially raise DNS’s  regular budget.
As a result, according to IAEA, U.S., and several  member-state officials, DNS continues to rely heavily on extra-budgetary  contributions and has a smaller proportion of regular budget funding than  other IAEA divisions, including other parts of the Department of Nuclear  Safety and Security.
DNS officials told us that they fulfill the agency’s central coordinating role  in nuclear security in two key ways: (1) by providing nuclear security  guidance that establishes the terms of reference for any nation working to  improve its nuclear security and that is used by all member states and (2)  by hosting and participating in key meetings."
614,"DOD did concur with this recommendation,  however never included a specific assessment of the extent to which  capability delivery dates for the European Phased Adaptive Approach  announced by the president in 2009 were contributing to concurrency;  instead, it asserts that BMDS technology development is  fundamentally driven by completion of technical milestones, not  schedule declarations.
In  addition, the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IIA program delivered one of four  planned test interceptors due to a flight test failure early in the year  suspending further deliveries pending completion of a failure review  board.
Moreover, according to MDA officials, construction contractor  performance issues will result in the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense  System Complex—Poland not being delivered until at least 18 months  after the planned December 2018 date.
Specifically, FTG-11, GMD’s first salvo test  (launching multiple interceptors at a single target), was delayed until the  second quarter of fiscal year 2019 to accommodate other BMDS testing  priorities while GMD fixed software issues uncovered during pre-test  planning.
According to MDA, it collaborated with Office of the Secretary of Defense  and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to identify programs and capabilities that  could be accelerated and delivered within the current Future Years  Defense Plan and directly address the North Korean missile threat.
Examples of recent UCAs follow:  In October 2017, MDA issued a sole source undefinitized contract  action for $60 million (according to DOD and MDA, the value was later  increased to $88 million) for the purposes of transitioning the Aegis  BMD SM-3 Block IIA program from development to production.
MDA Completed  Some Key Milestones  for Integrated  Regional BMDS  Capabilities, but Key  Aspects of Its  European Effort Have  Been Deferred and  Testing De-scoped In fiscal year 2018, MDA delivered regional capabilities to counter threats  from North Korea, but did not meet all of its 2018 goals for its effort in  Europe to counter intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) threats from  Iran, known as the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) Phase  3.
As we previously found, EPAA Phase 3 testing disruptions started in  2016, when MDA delayed the first and second intercept flight tests of the  Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IIA, the interceptor planned for fielding in EPAA  Phase 3.
Following a  failure investigation, and developmental work, MDA rectified the Aegis  BMD SM-3 Block IIA design flaws and successfully demonstrated them  against a medium-range ballistic missile target in October 2018, during  FTM-45.
Our analysis indicates that flight testing to demonstrate EPAA Phase 3  performance against IRBMs—the goal of Phase 3—has been reduced by  80 percent and even with the added 18-month delay, MDA no longer  plans to conduct a flight test against a raid prior to delivery in fiscal year  2020.
Appendix II: Aegis Ashore Key findings for Fiscal Year 2018  According to Missile Defense Agency officials, deficiencies in the performance of the military construction contractor resulted in a significant delay and increased cost for the Aegis Ashore facility in Poland.
As we previously reported, MDA has delayed  full production multiple times over the life of the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block  IB which was initially scheduled for fourth quarter, fiscal year 2012.
Appendix IV: Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense  (BMD) Standard Missile - 3 (SM-3) Block IIA Key findings for Fiscal Year 2018  A mid-year funding increase accelerated the program's schedule and increased the number of interceptors."
615,"Accordingly, OMB has issued several  memorandums regarding cybersecurity, including: OMB M-15-01, Fiscal Year 2014-2015 Guidance on Improving  Federal Information Security and Privacy Management Practices,  required DHS to perform regular scans of public facing segments of  federal civilian agency networks for vulnerabilities on an ongoing  basis, as well as in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities.
OMB M-19-02, Fiscal Year 2018-2019 Guidance on Federal  Information Security and Privacy Management Requirements,  provides agencies with guidance and deadlines to comply with FISMA  and reaffirms the value of agencies identifying and prioritizing their  high value assets (HVA) as directed by DHS and OMB.
These directives instruct agencies to, among other  things: mitigate critical vulnerabilities discovered by DHS’s NCCIC through its  scanning of agencies’ internet-accessible systems; better secure their HVAs by participating in risk and vulnerability  assessments (RVA) and security architecture reviews (SAR)  conducted on their assets; and address several urgent vulnerabilities in network infrastructure  devices identified in a NCCIC analysis report.
Binding Operational  Directives Often Have  Been Effective in  Addressing  Cybersecurity Risks,  but DHS Faces  Challenges in  Fulfilling Directive  Requirements Agencies’ implementation of the directives has resulted in improvements  that better safeguard federal information systems from a known or  reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or risk.
The remaining agency  identified the use or presence of Kaspersky-branded products in its  information systems and developed a detailed plan of action and provided  status reports to DHS every 30 days until completion on December 6,  2017.
In response to the directive and supplemental guidance, most of the  federal civilian agencies have taken several steps to address the  requirements, including identifying points of contact; submitting current  and prioritized HVA lists, if appropriate; participating in DHS-led  assessments if selected; and beginning to address identified  weaknesses.
In addition to the above requirements, DHS established a government- wide performance metric for agencies to address 45 percent of  critical/high severity weaknesses discovered through HVA assessments  within 30 days of them being reported, as required by the directive.
The challenges included  (1) outdated systems that require costly updates or replacements before  they can be brought into full compliance; (2) the lack of specialized  expertise to address technical requirements; (3) the complexity of  achieving full DMARC compliance; and (4) general issues associated with  addressing weaknesses in agency HVAs. To address the first and second challenges (outdated systems and  specialized expertise), in its March 2019 report to OMB, DHS provided  the following considerations for OMB: (1) examine agency budgets to  ensure agencies are deploying all available resources and capabilities  against threats to government networks and data; (2) provide  supplemental funds to agencies to support implementation of current and  future binding operational directives; and (3) examine agency budgets to ensure agencies are deploying all available resources to obtain  specialized training for staff or to hire specialized skill sets.
(This directive was revoked  and replaced by BOD 19-02, Vulnerability Remediation Requirements  for Internet-Accessible Systems in April 2019.) BOD 16-02, Threat to Network Infrastructure Devices (designated as  closed by DHS, March 2019), issued September 27, 2016 BOD 17-01, Removal of Kaspersky-branded Products, issued BOD 18-01, Enhance Email and Web Security, issued October 16, BOD 18-02, Securing High Value Assets, issued May 7, 2018  We then randomly selected a sample of 12 agencies from the civilian  executive branch agencies, to which DHS directives apply, to determine  the extent to which these agencies have taken steps to address the  directives’ requirements."
616,"NHTSA’s mission is to “save lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic  costs due to road traffic crashes through education, research, safety  standards and enforcement activity.”  As part of this mission, NHTSA  requires that rear guards be installed on most trailers.
These regulations include requirements for  rear guards for trailers consistent with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety  Standards and for single-unit trucks that are more than 30 inches above  the ground, as well as for multiple types of commercial vehicle  inspections that are performed by, for example, motor carriers and drivers  to ensure that commercial vehicles are safely operating.
Variability in the Data  Collection Process Likely  Leads to Underreporting Stakeholders we interviewed told us that underride crash fatalities are  likely underreported in FARS due to several factors, such as variability  across states in defining underride crashes, inconsistencies in state crash  reporting forms and documentation methods, and limited information  provided to state and local police on how to consistently identify and  record underride crash data.
NHTSA officials said that  they do not currently provide underride identification information directly  to state and local police who initially collect the crash data.
To help address fatalities associated with underride crash fatalities  involving single-unit trucks, as part of its 2013 study, NTSB  recommended that NHTSA develop standards for crashworthy rear, side,  and front guards for single-unit trucks, as well as devote efforts to crash  avoidance technologies and include more variables in FARS to improve  data collection.
An underride field in  MMUCC and additional information from NHTSA on how to identify and  record these crashes would provide greater assurance that state and  local police officers are accurately reporting data on underride crashes."
617,"FAA officials told us they intend to complete other related activities that  support the rule, such as finalizing guidance documents to provide  transparency and help ensure that licensing applicants understand the  new requirements.
Officials plan to use the results of this analysis in the fiscal years 2021– 2022 budget cycle to help estimate the number of staff currently needed  in specific positions within its five operational divisions.
In discussing  this approach AST officials stated that recent budget constraints have  limited their ability to address all of their current identified workforce  needs, which, according to their most recent workforce plan, are in nearly  all areas of their office.
FAA officials and commercial space industry  representatives said it also makes scheduling these operations more  challenging for launch providers, and affects FAA’s operational efficiency.
The Roadmap shows that FAA’s actions to better integrate commercial  space launch and reentry operations into the NAS include, but are not  limited to: developing new technologies; updating and assessing needed changes to policies, procedures, and  coordinating with aviation- and space-industry stakeholders.
According to an FAA official, for example,  four initiatives currently used to manage air traffic during other airspace  constraints could potentially be used during space launch operations.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology Our objectives for this report were to: (1) describe how the construction of  infrastructure at selected U.S. commercial launch sites has been funded;  (2) describe key factors that influence where orbital launches occur; (3)  summarize actions the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken  to streamline its commercial space launch regulations; (4) examine how  well-positioned FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST)  is to determine its current and future workforce needs; and (5) identify  actions FAA is taking to better integrate commercial space launch  operations into the National Airspace System (NAS).
In addition, we interviewed FAA officials  within AST, Air Traffic Organization, and the Office of NextGen regarding  their ongoing and planned actions for improving the integration of  commercial space transportation operations into the NAS."
618,"In complying with  BSA/AML requirements, U.S. financial institutions assist government  agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorist  financing by, among other things, establishing and maintaining  compliance programs, conducting ongoing monitoring of customers and  transactions, and reporting suspicious activity.
BSA/AML regulations require that each bank or money transmitter tailor a  compliance program that is specific to its own risks based on factors such  as the products and services offered and the customers and locations  served.
Moreover, our review of  bank examination documents found that BSA/AML-related deficiencies  mostly stemmed from weakness in banks’ BSA/AML compliance  programs and internal controls overall—for example, in customer  identification programs, customer due diligence procedures and practices,  and risk assessments—and not from a bank providing services to MSBs  or any other customer type.
For  example, examiners in some discussion groups said that such banks  have internal controls commensurate with the BSA/AML risks of the MSB  customers, including conducting appropriate monitoring and due diligence  of customers, and understand the full scope of MSB customers’ activities.
Similarly, our review of bank  examination documents included examples of banks with MSB customers  that complied with BSA/AML compliance program requirements, such as  a community bank with 80 money transmitters.
In  comparison, the expanded section’s guidance and procedures include  examples of specific steps that examiners can take when assessing  banks’ compliance with minimum due diligence requirements for MSB  accounts, such as applying the bank’s customer identification program  and confirming FinCEN registration status and state licensing, if  applicable.
Regulators and FinCEN issued  the 2005 interagency guidance to clarify BSA/AML requirements and  supervisory expectations for banks when providing banking services to  money transmitters and other MSBs. Since then, examiners have relied  on this guidance when reviewing banks’ MSB customer accounts.
For example, officials of one bank we interviewed  said they did not accept any MSB customers, including money  transmitters, because they were not willing or able to take on the required  risk and level of BSA/AML monitoring.
We then conducted two discussion groups per regulator with bank  examiners from the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, and NCUA to  understand how they applied the FFIEC manual in assessing BSA/AML  compliance controls of banks with money transmitter customers."
619,"Primary IRS  Publication Could  Better Help IRA  Owners with  Unconventional  Assets Understand  Complex Rules The first article in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights is the right to be informed  which means that taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do  to comply with tax laws.
Alternatives to adding more  pages to Publications 590-A and 590-B could include directing readers  with questions about rules affecting unconventional IRA assets to other  IRS resources, such as IRS web pages or tax regulations that contain  more technical and specialized information.
Prior to the newly available asset type data,  SB/SE conducted an interim Compliance Initiative Project (CIP) using  external state government information to identify businesses, including  LLCs and partnerships, owned by IRAs as a way to select IRA owners for  audit.
Such information could include: storage  requirements for IRA investments in certain precious metals; valuation  methods for hard-to-value IRA assets; the Department of Labor’s process  for granting exemptions to IRA prohibited transactions rules; and IRA  investments with the potential to create unrelated business income tax  liabilities."
620,"HRSA has not created a mechanism for covered  entities to use to identify 340B drugs provided to Medicaid managed care  beneficiaries, but encourages covered entities to work with states to  develop strategies to prevent duplicate discounts for drugs reimbursed  through managed care.
For  example: Connecticut did not have documented policies on the use and  identification of 340B drugs, but officials from the state reported that it  allowed covered entities to provide these drugs to Medicaid  beneficiaries and relied on the MEF to identify and exclude them from  rebate requests.
Additionally, CMS reviews states’ contracts with  Medicaid managed care plans to ensure that they include language  requiring the plans to have procedures to exclude 340B drugs from  Medicaid rebate data provided to states, but CMS officials told us that the  contract language does not have to specify or describe those  mechanisms, limiting the information available regarding duplicate  discount prevention efforts.
CMS officials told us that they do not track which procedures states use  to prevent duplicate discounts; review states’ policies or procedures for  identifying and excluding 340B drugs from rebate requests for  deficiencies or to ensure effectiveness; or audit states’ compliance with  the prohibition on duplicate discounts.
Additionally, HRSA  officials told us they would not require a covered entity to develop a  corrective action plan or make offers of repayment to a manufacturer if a  drug manufacturer’s audit of that covered entity identified a duplicate  discount in managed care."
621,"Specifically, CDC designed CORD phase 1 to require grantees to  implement demonstration projects that integrated public health and  primary care strategies by promoting children and their families’ use of  healthy behaviors and by modifying community environments.
I for additional information about the strategies CORD 1 grantees  implemented.) Examples of Strategies Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration Phase 1  Grantees Implemented  California Demonstration Project Public health strategies implemented included training staff at early care and  education centers on health behavior change strategies and providing centers  with large self-service water containers to promote increased water intake.
CDC  officials stated they considered returning to an integration of public health  and primary care strategies for CORD phase 3, similar to CORD phase 1,  but decided that the best use of resources was to focus on integrating  pediatric weight management interventions into communities, which  includes linking families with resources already available in the  community, such as low-cost physical activity offerings.
To assess the effectiveness of CORD  phase 1, CDC designed the cross-site evaluation to examine the  demonstration projects using a set of common outcome measures, which  the evaluation center developed in collaboration with CDC officials and  implementing grantees (see sidebar).
Thus, by designing CORD phase 3  to package evidence-based pediatric weight management interventions  that will be targeted to communities with low-income families, CDC  officials told us they hope to reduce the number of years before adoption  of such treatment strategies is prevalent.
Additionally,  the CORD phase 3 grants are implementing pediatric weight  management interventions in different settings—some in clinical settings  and some in community settings—which CDC officials said may provide  parents with additional flexibility to participate in the strategies."

623,"Specifically, from  the 2017/2018 surveys to the 2019 survey, there was a statistically  significant increase in the percentage of beneficiaries located in PSAs  who reported problems finding any type of civilian provider (27 to 34  percent), primary care providers (21 to 29 percent), and specialty care  providers (18 to 25 percent)."
624,"Background In 1994, Executive Order 12898 directed each federal agency to develop  an environmental justice strategy that identifies and addresses  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental  effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and  low-income populations.
Interagency Collaboration  on Environmental Justice The 1994 executive order also created an interagency working group to  coordinate federal environmental justice efforts by serving the following  seven functions: Provide guidance to federal agencies on criteria for identifying  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental  effects on minority populations and low-income populations.
These features include defining and articulating a  common outcome; reinforcing agency accountability for collaborative  efforts through agency plans and reports; developing mechanisms to  monitor, evaluate, and report on results; agreeing on or clarifying roles  and responsibilities; including all relevant participants and determining  their ability to commit resources; identifying and addressing resource  needs; and documenting written guidance and agreements.
Specifically, the agencies have not comprehensively  assessed how environmental justice fits with their overall missions or their  progress toward the implementation of their strategic goals by issuing  annual progress reports or by establishing methods to gauge their  progress, such as performance measures.
According to the working group’s charter, the working group creates  committees to carry out its responsibilities under this executive order, and  one of those committees—the Strategy and Implementation Progress  Report Committee—is to be available as a resource to federal agencies  as they develop and update their environmental justice strategies.
In the absence of annual progress reports that  evaluate progress using performance measures or milestones, we  interviewed agency officials about the progress they had made toward the  primary directive in Executive Order 12898—to identify and address  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental  effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority or low-income  populations.
Agencies Reported  Creating Data Tools and  Revising Processes for  Public Participation and  Environmental Review Most of the 16 agencies reported planning and implementing actions to  identify and address environmental justice issues to carry out the 1994  executive order and 2011 MOU.
One area that the group has not coordinated, however, is in  developing guidance on what to include in strategic plans, such as  demonstrating how environmental justice is part of an agency’s mission,  or developing methods to assess and report on progress, which many of  the agencies said they needed.
EPA stated that it disagrees with recommendations 23 and 24; instead of  updating the MOU, the agency will lead efforts to update the working  group’s fiscal year 2016-2018 Framework for Collaboration to include  guidance for strategic plans, tracking progress toward goals, and defining  alignment with the executive order.
We agree with  EPA that the working group can benefit from greater guidance on  strategic plans, tracking goals, and alignment with the executive order to  carry out federal environmental justice efforts.
In an email, a HUD audit liaison official stated that the agency  had no comments at this time and will continue to work with the current  administration and the working group to update its environmental justice  strategic plan and issue a progress report on its environmental justice  efforts."
625,"DOL’s ETA Managed  Compliance with the  Stevens Amendment  through Its Grantee  Monitoring  Processes, Though  Most HHS Operating  Divisions and  Education Did Not The regulations that govern DOL, HHS, and Education’s management of  grant awards state that “the Federal awarding agency must manage and  administer the federal award in a manner so as to ensure that Federal  funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full  accordance with U.S. statutory and public policy requirements.” The  Stevens Amendment is a statutory requirement that these federal  agencies must ensure is implemented by their grantees.
The Uniform Administrative Requirements that govern certain federal  agencies, including DOL, state with regard to the management of grants  that “the Federal awarding agency must manage and administer the  Federal award in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is  expended and associated programs are implemented in full accordance  with U.S. statutory and public policy requirements.” Other than ETA,  DOL’s subagencies have not developed the processes needed to  manage and administer grantees’ compliance with the Stevens  Amendment.
Without having processes to manage and administer their grantees’  compliance with the Stevens Amendment, which is included in HHS’s  appropriations provisions, there is no way for HHS or its operating  divisions to ensure that grantees are in full accordance with the statutory  requirements of the Stevens Amendment appropriations provision and the  agency-communicated conditions of the federal award."
626,"We recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) standardize  planning efforts for hazard mitigation after a disaster and (2) develop  performance measures for the Public Assistance grant program to better  align with FEMA’s strategic goal for hazard mitigation in the recovery  process.
Many of the challenges we identified  are also described in FEMA’s 2017 Hurricane Season FEMA After-Action  Report, including:  the sequential and overlapping timing of the three hurricanes—with  Maria being the last of the three—caused staffing shortages and  required FEMA to shift staff to the territories that were already  deployed to other disasters;  the far distance of both territories from the U.S. mainland complicated  efforts to deploy federal resources and personnel quickly; and  the incapacitation of local response functions due to widespread  devastation and loss of power and communications, and limited  preparedness by Puerto Rico and the USVI for a category 5 hurricane  resulted in FEMA having to assume response functions that territories  would usually perform themselves.
As a result of this and other  challenges identified, we made nine recommendations to FEMA,  including that it update its strategy and guidance to clarify the use of  advance contracts, improve the timeliness of its acquisition planning  activities, revise its methodology for reporting disaster contracting actions  to Congress, and provide more consistent guidance and information for  contracting officers in coordinating with states and localities to establish  advance contracts.
Specifically, we reported on FEMA’s use of its redesigned delivery model  for providing grants under the Public Assistance program, as well as the  alternative procedures for administering or receiving such grant funds that  FEMA allows states, territories, and local governments to use for their  recovery.
In September 2018,  we reported that local officials continued to experience challenges with  using the new Public Assistance web-based, case management system  following the 2017 disasters, such as not having sufficient guidance on  how to use the new system and delays with FEMA’s processing of their  projects.
Based on our findings from our November and December 2017 reports,  we recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) complete  workforce staffing assessments that identify the appropriate number of  staff needed to implement the redesigned Public Assistance delivery  model, and (2) document steps for hiring, training, and retaining key  appeals staff, and address staff transitions resulting from deployments to  disasters."

628,"Cost and schedule growth in DOD’s space programs is sometimes driven  by the inherent risks associated with developing complex space  technology; however, over the past 10 years we have identified a number  of other management and oversight problems that have worsened the  situation.
While SBIRS and other satellite programs provide  users with important and useful capabilities, their cost growth has  significantly limited the department’s buying power at a time when more  resources may be needed to protect space systems and recapitalize the  space portfolio.
For example, in October 2014, we found that disaggregation  could require DOD to make significant cultural and process changes in  how it acquires space systems—for instance, by relying on new  contractors, relinquishing control to providers who host government  payloads on commercial satellites, using different contracting methods,  and executing smaller but more numerous and faster-paced acquisition  programs.
Space Leadership  Changes Are a Positive  Step, But Have Some Risk We and others have reported for over two decades that fragmentation  and overlap in DOD space acquisition management and oversight have  contributed to program delays and cancellations, cost increases, and  inefficient operations.

The DC Government  tasked multiple offices in its organization to help with ensuring event  security, including the Metropolitan Police Department, which  deployed uniformed officers in areas surrounding the National Mall  and provided traffic control and road closures.
This was accomplished by coordination  between the following federal agencies and state and local jurisdictions: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided  medical aid stations for attendees and participants and veterinarian  services for NPS working animals at various locations on the National  Mall."

DOJ does not directly fund rule of law assistance, but its Office of  Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT)  and the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program  (ICITAP) implement activities funded by agencies such as State, USAID,  and DOD through interagency agreements.
State, USAID, and DOJ  Have National and  Agency-Specific  Strategies on Rule of Law  Assistance and Determine  Roles and Responsibilities  for Relevant Bureaus and  Offices Improving the rule of law in partner countries overseas is identified as an  important objective in several strategic documents including the 2017  National Security Strategy, the 2018-2022 State-USAID Joint Strategic  Plan, the 2018-2022 DOJ Strategic Plan, and bureau-specific plans.
INL officials  said they sometimes also coordinated rule of law assistance amongst  agencies through a Law Enforcement Working Group—which also did  not always include other relevant agencies—or through the Human  Rights Working Group, which did include State, USAID, and DOJ,  according to INL.
The 2018-2022 State-USAID Joint Strategic Plan notes that  State and USAID will work with their interagency partners to coordinate  strategies and programs, including their efforts related to providing rule of  law assistance.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report examines (1) how much funding the Department of State  (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated  for rule of law assistance in fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) how  agencies strategically plan and coordinate the allocation of rule of law  assistance; and (3) what processes agencies have to design, implement,  and coordinate rule of law assistance programs in selected countries.
To examine the processes used by State, USAID, and DOJ to design,  implement and coordinate rule of law assistance in selected countries, we  reviewed documents and interviewed agency and local government  officials and implementing organization staff."
633,"Acquisition Workforce  Challenges Leading up to program year 2016, ETA national officials said they  encountered a number of acquisition workforce challenges that affected  their ability to competitively award Job Corps center contracts.
Also, national officials said that contracting officers were unable  to competitively award center contracts because of the time needed to  carry out acquisition planning tasks, which as we have previously  reported, are important to establishing a strong foundation for the  contracting process.
Additionally, in the written justification and approval documents for  noncompetitive bridge contracts related to 35 of the 68 Job Corps centers  that operated under bridge contracts during program year 2016, ETA  officials noted that they had to divert contracting staff to implement  contracting changes that resulted from the passage of WIOA.
Additionally, in written justification and  approval documents for noncompetitive bridge contracts related to 34 of  the 68 Job Corps centers that operated under bridge contracts during  program year 2016, ETA officials noted that they diverted staff from  awarding Job Corps procurements to address financial issues  encountered by the program.
For example, in the justification and approval documents  we reviewed related to contracts for four centers, ETA officials said  procurements for competitive Job Corps center contracts were  suspended because the pre-award processes had been compromised  due to the unauthorized release of confidential contractor information in  2015.
However, at the time of our review, the Office of  Financial Administration had not developed an internal documented  process to share information about its fee calculations on specific Job  Corps center evaluations with program and contracting officials.
These methods  include analyzing data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG), conducting a nongeneralizable review of 10 Job  Corps centers that operated under bridge or noncompetitive contracts,  and conducting interviews with ETA regional and national officials.
In  addition, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and agency  policies and procedures such as Job Corps’ Policy and Requirements  Handbook, the Acquisition Handbook for Job Corps Regional Contracts,  and other information ETA provided related to incentive fees and the  number of staff vacancies and protests filed in program years 2012 to  2016."
634,"We  recommended VA ensure that VA medical centers consistently and  accurately implement VA’s scheduling policy, including use of the  electronic wait list, as well as ensuring that all staff with access to the  scheduling system completes the required training.
VA Has Taken Steps to  Address Our  Recommendations to  Strengthen Enrollment  Processes and  Management of Initial  Requests for Care That  Affect Veterans’ Timely  Appointments In addition to the recommendations we made to improve VA’s wait-time  data and implementation of its scheduling policy, we have also made  recommendations to address other factors that affect the timeliness by  which veterans obtain appointments.
Under VA’s scheduling processes, this potential wait time  included VA medical centers having at least 18 calendar days to prepare  veterans’ Choice Program referrals to TPAs and another 52 calendar  days for appointments to occur as scheduled by TPAs. Based on this finding, we recommended that VA establish an achievable  wait-time goal for the VCCP that will permit VA to monitor whether  veterans are receiving community care within time frames that are  comparable to the amount of time they would otherwise wait to receive  care at VA medical facilities."

636,"Some Caregivers  Experienced Adverse  Effects on Their Jobs  and on Their  Retirement Assets  and Income Parental and Spousal  Caregivers Said  Caregiving Affected Their  Work An estimated 68 percent of working parental and spousal caregivers said  they experienced at least one of eight job impacts about which they were  asked, according to our analysis of data used in the 2015 National  Alliance for Caregiving and AARP sponsored study, Caregiving in the  U.S. The highest percentage of parental and spousal caregivers—more  than half—reported that they went in late, left early, or took time off during  the day to provide care (see fig.
Spousal Caregivers  Nearing Retirement Had  Less in Retirement Assets  and Income While  Parental Caregivers Did  Not We found that spousal caregivers who were at or near the age of full  retirement eligibility had lower levels of IRA assets, non-IRA assets, and  Social Security income compared to those who did not provide care.
One possible explanation experts offered for why spousal caregivers may  have less in retirement income and assets than non-caregivers is that the  care recipient may be in poor health, resulting in reduced workforce  participation of both members of the household, which could then have a  large negative impact on household wealth.
We  compared the retirement assets and income of parental caregivers to the  retirement assets and income of individuals who did not provide parental  care and did not find a statistically significant effect of parental caregiving  on IRA assets, non-IRA assets, defined contribution balances, or Social  Security income.
As discussed  previously, women were more likely to provide parental and spousal care,  to work part-time, and to have lower earnings than men caregivers.
We conducted descriptive analyses to examine differences between  spousal caregivers and non-caregivers in terms of assets at or near  retirement and Social Security income during retirement.
2.  We conducted regression analyses to examine whether observed  differences in assets and Social Security income were still statistically  significant when we controlled for these differences in the spousal  caregiving and non-caregiving populations."
637,"The rate-setting process currently includes  a 10-step methodology generally designed to account for the estimated  annual revenues needed by registered U.S. Great Lakes pilots to provide  pilotage services and total vessel traffic expected in each of the three  U.S. pilotage districts.
(See appendix I for further details on the pilotage  rate-setting methodology.) Among other regulatory roles, the U.S. Coast  Guard is also responsible for developing competency standards for pilot  training and issuing pilot registrations, providing oversight of the pilot  associations, and determining the total number of authorized pilots  operating in the U.S. waters of the Great Lakes-Seaway.
Issues identified by shipping industry  stakeholders relate, in large part, to the financial impacts associated with  the Coast Guard’s methodology for calculating pilotage rates, as well as  other areas where enhanced transparency or oversight is suggested.
According to these Coast Guard program officials,  operational coordination and routine meetings with stakeholders provide  ongoing opportunities to obtain input on the Great Lakes Pilotage  Program and help inform potential changes that may be needed.
The key issues cited by shipping industry  stakeholders in recent years generally fall into four categories: (1)  financial oversight and cost accounting, (2) vessel traffic estimates, (3)  pilot compensation and staffing, and (4) billing and dispute resolution.
The Coast Guard uses the following 10-step methodology to calculate  revenues needed for each Great Lakes pilotage association based on the  estimated volume of foreign vessel traffic for the upcoming shipping  season."

NPS officials at the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area near  Redding, California, said that many of the fuel reduction projects they  undertake are designed to reduce risk to local communities and  restore ecosystem health.
For example, officials said  they generally used information incorporated into a national geospatial  database that the Forest Service developed to estimate the relative  probability a given area faces of experiencing a wildfire that would be  difficult for suppression resources to contain and therefore may cause  damage to communities or ecosystems.
In fiscal year 2018, the Forest Service  and Interior implemented fuel reduction projects that treated  approximately 1.7 million and 1.3 million acres, respectively, of lands they  manage or administer."

Corps project teams may include in  the economic analysis recreational benefits that stem directly from the  project alternative but that are incidental to the primary purpose of  damage reduction, according to the Corps’ Planning Guidance."
649,"According to CDC officials, the National Center for  Health Statistics uses these coded records to compile national vital  statistics files in NVSS, which is the source of official statistics on  mortality in the United States, including maternal deaths.
However due to staggered implementation of  the 2003 revised death certificate by the states and reliability concerns  about the use of the pregnancy checkbox, CDC officials said that as of  September 2019, they have not published NVSS statistics on maternal  mortality in the agency’s annual mortality reports since the report on  deaths that occurred in 2007.
To collect the additional data, CDC officials annually send requests to  vital records offices for all 50 states and other applicable jurisdictions to  provide the following: death certificates, linked live birth or fetal death  certificates, and any other supporting information for 1) deaths with an  ICD-10 Chapter O code for the previous year, and 2) all deaths from any  cause (including injury or trauma) among women who were pregnant or  were within 1 year of pregnancy as identified by matching the death  certificate to a birth or fetal death certificate or by a pregnancy checkbox  on the death certificate.
For  example, according to Georgia officials, Georgia’s PQC received funding  from CDC and implemented the AIM obstetric hemorrhage maternal  safety bundle in 2018 based on the state’s MMRC finding that  hemorrhage was a leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in Georgia."
650,"Consistent with general  economic theory, these factors fall into three groups: (1) an FBO’s costs,  (2) demand for an FBO’s services, and (3) competition among FBOs. Stakeholders Reported  That Cost Factors May  Influence Prices Selected stakeholders we interviewed highlighted cost factors such as  airport leases, infrastructure investment, fuel, labor, and security as  influencing FBO prices.
Further, most general aviation pilots we spoke with told us they use online  flight-planning tools to map their route and consider the fuel cost and  service fees of the airports along that route.
As we have noted, we expected fuel prices to be correlated with a variety  of cost, demand, and competition factors that pertain to characteristics of  airports and their locations, as well as characteristics of FBOs operating  at airports.
Specifically, for the all-airports dataset, we found that, on average,  the posted price of Jet A was 35 cents per gallon higher if only  one FBO sold the fuel at an airport compared to the case when at  least one additional competitor also served the airport.
Structure of Model, Data  Sources, and Variable  Definitions Based on our audit work as well as economic reasoning, we hypothesized  that a variety of factors may be correlated with aviation fuel prices across  airports.
We thus expected  that an airport served by a large-chain FBO may have higher average  fuel prices due to the costs of providing such services."
651,"According to USDA guidance, examples of operations it  reviews during management evaluations include (1) state oversight of  certification and verification of students into the school meals  programs, (2) administrative reviews of school districts conducted by  state agencies, (3) claims for reimbursement, and (4) state oversight  of compliance with federal meal pattern requirements, among other  areas.
Although the errors will not be considered in determining the  reported estimated improper payment error rates, USDA officials stated  that the agency is committed to reducing meal claiming error and will  continue to measure it as part of its periodic APEC studies.
According to agency officials, USDA’s efforts to assess overall program  integrity risks in the school meals programs include researching,  monitoring, and reporting activities designed to identify areas of program  operations susceptible to improper payments and program error."
652,"For the 2010 Census, the address  canvassing operation mobilized almost 150,000 field workers to canvass  almost every street in the United States and Puerto Rico to update the  Bureau’s address list and map data—and in 2012 reported the cost at  nearly $450 million.
According to Bureau  officials, listers were more productive due to efficiency gains from the  Bureau’s new approach, including an automated time and attendance  system, the use of computer laptops to collect census data, and a new  operational control system that was used to electronically optimize  assignments and transmit work to listers."
653,"We recommended that  the Air Force establish desired learning objectives and training support  elements needed to accomplish the training expectations identified by the  Ready Aircrew Program and develop a process to collect data to assess  the effectiveness of annual training against these features.
The following summarizes the Air Force position by concurrence  category:  Concur: In concurring with RAND Recommendations 2 and 8—to  invest in data systems for the collection, access, and storage of data  to correct deficiencies in current systems and improve analysis and  readiness reporting—the Air Force stated that, before the  recommendations were made, it had made available $5.15 million in  fiscal year 2020 funding to develop an Aircrew Readiness Training  Management Module as an upgrade to the Air Force’s Aviation  Resource Management System."
654,"According to  FEMA, NFIP was designed to address the policy objectives of identifying  flood hazards, offering affordable insurance premiums to encourage  program participation, and promoting community-based floodplain  management.
NFIP also offers Increased Cost  of Compliance coverage for most policies, which provides up to $30,000  to help cover the cost of mitigation measures following a flood loss when  a property is declared to be substantially or repetitively damaged.
FEMA has three  definitions for such properties that vary slightly to meet the specific needs  of different programs: NFIP Repetitive Loss refers to an NFIP-insured structure that has  incurred flood-related damage on two occasions during a 10-year  period, each resulting in at least a $1,000 claim payment.
FEMA  uses the NFIP RL definition for insurance purposes related to the  Community Rating System, for local hazard mitigation plans, and for  eligibility determinations for preferred risk policies and individual  assistance.
HMA grants fund a variety of  methods to mitigate the flood risk of properties, including acquisition,  elevation, relocation, and floodproofing.
Our objectives were to  examine (1) funding programs available for property acquisitions, (2)  FEMA’s flood mitigation efforts, and (3) factors contributing to NFIP’s  fiscal exposure."
655,"Entrance into this stage occurs when the NSF Director  approves the proposed research infrastructure as a national priority  and the sponsoring directorate makes an award (either through a  cooperative agreement or contract) for developing detailed project  cost, scope, and schedule for possible construction.
However,  if the sponsoring directorate funds construction, the policies and  procedures in NSF’s Major Facilities Guide apply if total project costs  meet the definition of a major multiuser research facility project under the  American Innovation and Competitiveness Act—that is, if the costs  exceed $100 million or 10 percent of the responsible directorate’s annual  budget, whichever is less.
In this report, we identify total project costs for the construction of major  facility projects which were developed during the design phase based on  the latest estimates available from NSF officials; those estimates are  subject to change before construction awards are made.
In addition to the performance measurement baseline and budget  contingency, a project’s not-to-exceed cost that the National Science  Board authorized may include the following: Fee. NSF may provide recipients the opportunity to earn a fee  (formerly referred to by NSF as a management fee) for major facilities  projects.
Under NSF policy, a major facility  project’s cost, scope, and schedule are not finalized until after the final  design review, when the National Science Board authorizes a not-to- exceed cost and an award duration.
In our June 2018 report, we found that  procedures documented in NSF’s policies for major facilities projects fully  or substantially met many best practices and partially or minimally met  others identified in GAO’s guide for developing project cost estimates.
According to NSF officials, the mid-scale program is designed to identify  potential projects with shorter implementation timelines and high levels of  readiness as compared to the multiyear, incremental refinements to cost,  scope, and schedule that occur with major facilities projects.
Latest Construction Award Since our March 2019 report, NSF’s Rubin Observatory project had no  changes to its authorized total project cost and implemented one scope  reduction option valued at $1.4 million to increase available budget  contingency.
Cost and Schedule Performance History  As of September 2019, NSF’s AIMS project had no changes to its  authorized total project cost, changes to its estimated completion date, or  scope reductions since the National Science Board authorized the  project’s not-to-exceed cost of $410.4 million, which included $67.2  million in budget contingency, in February 2019."
656,"The evaluation plan stated the Senior  Review Team could, at its discretion, request that QCO seek additional  information from applicants to help QCO determine if a large project met  the statutory requirements.
When we identified similar issues related to a lack of  consistent and transparent follow-up with FASTLANE applicants, we  recommended DOT develop an INFRA evaluation plan that clearly  defines how all review teams should apply criteria, assess applications,  and assign ratings to ensure that all applications are consistently  reviewed.
Documenting the rationale for award  decisions becomes even more important in light of DOT’s decision to  provide every eligible INFRA application to the Secretary, rather than  providing the Secretary a list of the projects “most likely to achieve the  intended purpose.” However, DOT’s documentation on the final selection  of projects states the anticipated benefits of the projects but does not  indicate why these projects, according to DOT’s guidance, “best address  program requirements and, therefore, are most worthy of funding.” In our  review of the FASTLANE process, we also noted that due to limited  documentation, we could not determine how DOT selected which projects  should receive awards.
Specifically, we recommended that the Secretary issue a department- wide directive that should include requirements to: develop a plan for evaluating project proposals in advance of issuing  a notice of funding availability that defines the stages of the process,  including how the process will be overseen to ensure a consistent  review of applications; document key decisions, including the reason for any rating changes  and the officials responsible for those changes, and how high-level  concerns raised during the process were addressed; and align stated program purpose and policy priorities with the evaluation  and selection process."
657,"IRS officials also stated that they are working directly with tax  practitioners to help improve the quality of the data they collect to better  inform future business IDT fraud filters and models.
IRS business units use current and prior year tax return data and  information on known business IDT threats to improve existing fraud  detection efforts and develop new efforts.
In addition, IRS officials stated that at the end of each filing season, they  review and analyze confirmed business IDT cases to identify any new  patterns or trends that may be useful for enhancing existing fraud filters  and developing fraud detection models in RRP.
In addition, officials from IRS’s Office of the Chief Risk Officer stated that  consistent with the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015  (FRDAA), the agency compiles an annual enterprise-wide fraud risk  report based on program-level risks that IRS business units identify and  monitor.
IRS officials stated that they have not performed a formal fraud risk  assessment or developed a fraud risk profile for business IDT because  they have directed their resources toward identifying and addressing  fraud that is occurring right now and improving fraud detection efforts.
Our review of IRS documentation found that business units have  developed procedures to manage and resolve business IDT cases  identified during different stages of the tax return process.
We interviewed officials from RICS, AM, CI, and RAAS and reviewed  documentation on IRS’s efforts to identify and assess business IDT  fraud risks."
658,"Rather, TSA regularly  partners with mass transit operators to address their security needs by  conducting vulnerability assessments, sharing intelligence information  and best practices, and working to mitigate security risks to their systems  by assessing commercially available security technologies, among other  measures.
TSA established the  program to assess the effectiveness of emerging and existing security  technologies in real-world environments; verify prior laboratory testing  performance results versus performance in a TSA mass transit system (or  other surface transportation mode serving as a test bed); and develop  recommendations for use of certain technologies in surface  transportation.
In addition, TSA officials stated that while they try to  address all identified surface transportation capability gaps, due to limited  resources, they tend to select, on an annual basis, products for testing  related to the following gaps: anomaly and explosive detection, high  throughput threat detection, intrusion detection, infrastructure protection,  and chemical and biological threat security, all of which have applicability  to the mass transit environment.
During the course of our review, we  identified four key mechanisms that S&T, TSA, and mass transit  operators use to collaborate on mass transit security issues—the DHS  IPT process’s sub-IPT focusing on surface transportation capability gaps  (including those pertaining to mass transit); the Intermodal Transportation  Systems Research and Development Working Group (RDWG); TSA’s  Operational Test Bed Program; and the Transit Policing and Security  Peer Advisory Group (PAG) (see table 1).
For  example, S&T officials said that anomaly and explosive and high- throughput threat detection were the gaps identified by the participants of  the RDWG and then reported through the DHS IPT process, which  ultimately helped inform the scope of S&T’s STETD program."
659,"For example,  In 2016, we reported that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services Transformation program, which was using Agile software  development to modernize citizenship and immigration benefits  processing, needed to improve testing of its software code and ensure  its approaches to interoperability and end user testing met leading  practices.
We made 12 recommendations to improve  Transformation program management, including ensuring alignment  among policy, guidance, and leading practices in areas such as Agile  software development and systems integration and testing.
We reported in October 2017 that the Transportation Security  Administration Technology Infrastructure Modernization program had  not defined key roles and responsibilities, prioritized system  requirements, or implemented automated capabilities that were  essential to ensuring effective adoption of Agile.
By  providing policy or guidance to ensure that all personnel staffed to an  Agile program or project receive appropriate training, the department  can better prepare program staff to plan and execute appropriately,  and increase the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes of the  transition to Agile.
Nevertheless, DHS did not provide assurance that the metrics  associated with development pace would be included in this revised  set of metrics or that programs would consistently report that  information in order for the department to track and monitor the pace  of Agile teams.
For program level practices, addressing training  requirements for all necessary staff and tracking and monitoring the pace  of Agile team development can help ensure teams’ success.
The Secretary should ensure that the Director of Strategic Technology  Management (STM), in collaboration with other members of the  Information Technology Program Management Center of Excellence  (ITPM COE), identifies the skills and resources needed to complete the  work intended for the upcoming fiscal year, including the availability of  supplementary staff, such as subject matter experts.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary should ensure that the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO)  defines a process and associated set of controls to ensure that Agile  programs and projects are reporting a set of core required performance  metrics for monitoring and measuring Agile adoption.
(Recommendation 8) The Secretary should ensure that the CIO, in collaboration with the  Executive Director of the Office of Program Accountability and Risk  Management (PARM), update or develop new guidance on Agile  methodologies to describe how Agile teams can estimate the relative  complexity of user stories.
In  addition, the department stated that it had addressed our  recommendation to define a process and controls to ensure that Agile  programs and projects are reporting a set of core required performance  metrics for monitoring and measuring Agile adoption.
Specifically, DHS stated that the DHS OCIO will gather  requirements from components via its IT workforce planning integrated  project team to identify training resources available across the  department that also address the skill sets needed for Agile programs.
In  particular, we reviewed training materials prepared by the Homeland  Security Acquisition Institute for acquisition workforce certifications and  webinars offered by the Procurement Innovation Lab; ITPM COE Agile  artifacts discussed under our assessment of the implementation of  organizational change management leading practices, such as the Agile  core metrics; and Agile-specific technical review completion letters, such  as the release planning review.
For programs to successfully transition from  processes used for traditional development projects, programs should  ensure that  staff are appropriately trained in Agile methods by ensuring Agile teams have the appropriate technical expertise  needed to perform their roles  technical environments enable Agile development through making technical and project support tools available, and designing a system that supports iterative delivery project planning controls are compatible with Agile methods by maintaining a sustainable development pace and tracking and defining and incorporating non-functional requirements in defining and incorporating critical features in development  The department develops an environment that supports these processes.
According to the Information Technology Acquisition Review Essentials  Guide, Agile subject matter experts in the department review proposed  contracts to ensure that they will enable development activities that  adhere to Agile best practices and DHS systems engineering life cycle  (SELC) guidance.
According to the instructions included in  the request for contractor proposals, this technical challenge required the  contractor to leverage Agile best practices to design, develop, and  demonstrate working software that addressed user stories provided by  the program.
Project planning controls are  compatible with Agile  development Agency policy or guidance should call for teams to maintain a sustainable  development pace and track and monitor that pace and for non-functional  requirements and critical features to be defined and incorporated in  development.
For teams to successfully transition from processes using traditional  software development methods to Agile methods, leading practices for  team activities and dynamics recommend that  the composition of the team supports Agile methods by defining the role of a product owner work is prioritized to maximize value for the customer through  creating user stories to define work prioritizing requirements in a backlog based on value estimating the relative complexity of user stories  repeatable processes are in place by meeting daily to review progress and discuss impediments ensuring the quality of code being developed  Within DHS, program management offices are responsible for planning  and executing individual programs and implementing applicable Agile  methodologies.
The DHS Agile  instruction manual stated that, during sprint planning, the product owner  meets with the development team in order to identify user stories from the  backlog that should be prioritized for the upcoming sprint and that  prioritization decisions should be made based on value to the users."
660,"In the last 2 years, we issued reports on  TSA’s foreign airport and air carrier inspection programs (December  2017), assessments of Cuban aviation security (July 2018), and TSA’s  process for reviewing security directives and emergency amendments  that apply at last point of departure airports (October 2019).
In  December 2017, we reported that TSA had taken steps to enhance its  foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections since 2011,  including aligning resources based on risk, resolving airport access  issues, making evaluations more comprehensive, and creating  operational efficiencies."
661,"The Office of Finance identifies and approves broker-dealers for the  banks’ debt issuance transactions, including diverse broker-dealers that  are minority-, women-, disabled-, and veteran-owned.
As part of its  approval process, the Office of Finance assesses the broker-dealers  based on their track record in conducting certain debt transactions, and  reviews documents including broker-dealers’ audited financial statements,  documentation on capital sustainability, legal or regulatory issues,  diversity certification, procedures, and any other issues that may affect  their eligibility or performance.
Among other things, the 2010 rule required each bank to create its own  OMWI or designate an office to perform duties related to the bank’s  diversity efforts, and establish policies related to diversity and inclusion,  including workforce and business activities (which can include suppliers  and broker-dealers used for capital markets activities).
The 2010 rule also requires FHLBanks to submit an annual report to  FHFA that describes the gender and racial/ethnic composition of the  bank’s workforce and of the suppliers and broker-dealers used in  business activities and past and future diversity and inclusion efforts in  these areas.
FHLBanks Described Practices  They Use to Help Maintain and  Increase Workforce Diversity We found that FHLBanks implemented and continue to implement a  variety of practices to maintain and increase diversity in their workforces,  based on our review of the FHLBanks’ annual Office of Minority and  Women Inclusion (OMWI) reports, FHFA examination documents,  FHLBank diversity and inclusion strategic plans, and interviews with  FHLBank staff from all 11 banks.
While the Office of Finance reports debt  volume data and other data, such as number of transactions conducted  by diverse broker-dealers, to FHFA, staff noted that they also use two  other performance goals to measure their capital markets diversity efforts.
For example, staff from six banks and the Office  of Finance said that diverse broker-dealers often do not have the level of  capital required by the banks to make the capital markets transactions the  banks need."

663,"The Moving Ahead for  Progress in the 21st Century Act, enacted in 2012, formally required the  Secretary of the Department of Transportation to, among other things,  establish performance measures for states to use to assess fatalities and  serious injuries to ensure further accountability for federal traffic safety  funding provided to states.
NHTSA and FHWA require states to submit annual plans and reports to  establish targets and describe their use of federal funds to improve safety  and the results they have achieved relative to their targets.
While NHTSA has established requirements for states to provide  assessments of their progress on achieving the prior year targets in their  Highway Safety Plans and Annual Reports, we found that many states  have not done so.
Beyond the required interim state assessments of progress contained in  the Annual Reports and Highway Safety Plans, NHTSA does not  communicate to the public and other stakeholders about whether states  eventually achieve their fatality targets.
To ensure that the framework helps states to improve traffic safety,  NHTSA regulations require states to include at least one performance  measure (and associated target) for each program area contained in their  Highway Safety Plans."

667,"Compact Grants and Trust  Fund Contributions The amended compacts’ implementing legislation authorized and  appropriated direct financial assistance to the FSM and the RMI in fiscal  years 2004 through 2023, with the base amounts decreasing in most  years.
Projections Show Risks to  Compact Trust Fund  Disbursements Our May 2018 projections for the FSM and RMI compact trust funds after  2023 indicated that, given their balance at the end of fiscal year 2017 and  current compact trust fund rules—the baseline scenario—the funds will be unable to provide maximum disbursements (equal to the inflation- adjusted amount of annual grant assistance in 2023) in some years   and unable to provide any disbursement at all in some years, with the  likelihood of zero disbursement in a given year increasing over time.
Under the agreements, each  trust fund committee must develop a distribution policy, with the intent  that compact trust fund disbursements will provide an annual source of  revenue to the FSM and RMI after the scheduled end of compact grant  assistance.
Programs Identified in  Other Legislation  Generally Continue after  Fiscal Year 2023 In addition to being eligible for the programs provided through the  compact, its associated agreements, and the amended compacts’  implementing legislation, the FSM and RMI are also eligible for a number  of programs under other provisions of current U.S. law."
668,"We  identified seven steps related to NNSA’s efforts to implement common  financial reporting in our January 2019 report: (1) identifying an approach  and developing a tool to implement common financial reporting, (2)  developing a policy, (3) establishing common cost elements and  definitions, (4) identifying and reporting costs for programs of record and  base capabilities, (5) implementing a common work breakdown structure,  (6) collecting financial data from the M&O contractors, and (7) publishing  and analyzing data.
We recommended that NNSA implement a common work breakdown  structure across its participating program offices because without doing  so, NNSA could not ensure that its efforts would result in the collection of  reliable, enterprise-wide financial data that satisfies the needs of  Congress and enables NNSA to report the total costs of its programs.
Representatives from the seven M&O contractors  stated that they encountered challenges in submitting their data in  CostEX on multiple occasions throughout fiscal years 2018 and 2019  because federal program managers in some offices made frequent  changes to the work breakdown structures that often were not  communicated to the M&O contractors in a timely manner.
NNSA’s Approach  Provides Limited  Assurance That Data  Collected are  Accurate and  Consistent to Perform  Agency-Wide Data  Analysis NNSA Has Not Verified  Whether Contractors  Accurately Crosswalk  Financial Data to Work  Breakdown Structures As discussed previously, M&O contractors crosswalk their financial data  into a reporting framework using work breakdown structures and common  cost elements and definitions, and they submit their data to NNSA using  CostEX.
(Recommendation 2) The Program Director for Financial Integration should develop and  implement an internal process for NNSA to verify how the M&O  contractors crosswalk financial data from their systems to the appropriate  NNSA work breakdown structure to ensure the reported data are accurate  and consistent."
669,"FCC’s functions include:  issuing licenses for broadcast television and radio; overseeing licensing, enforcement, and regulatory functions of  carriers of cellular phones and other personal communication  services;  regulating the use of radio spectrum and conducting auctions of  licenses for spectrum;  investigating complaints and taking enforcement actions if it finds that  there have been violations of the various communications laws and  commission rules that are designed to protect consumers; addressing issues related to public safety, homeland security,  emergency management, and preparedness; educating and informing consumers about communications goods and  reviewing mergers of companies holding FCC-issued licenses.
Further, the program should include  testing and evaluating the effectiveness of controls; planning,  implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to address  information security deficiencies; developing and implementing  procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents;  and ensuring continuity of operations.
Deficiencies existed in the FCC information security program and  technical controls for the five core functions that were intended to (1)  identify risk, (2) protect systems from threats and vulnerabilities, (3)  detect cybersecurity events, (4) respond to these events, and (5) recover  system operations when disruptions occur.
We reported in September 2019 that, as part of its information security  program, FCC had implemented controls for incident response by  developing, documenting, and annually updating its incident handling  policy and procedures, along with its guidelines for remediating  deficiencies.
Specifically, we recommended that FCC take  nine actions to improve its information security program by, among other  things, authorizing systems to operate, documenting operating  procedures, resolving known vulnerabilities and reporting security  incidents in a timely manner, and testing disaster recovery plans.
Specifically, FCC’s  actions to implement four information security program-related  recommendations included conducting a disaster recovery test exercise,  documenting detailed system restoration procedures, and updating risk  assessments to reflect the commission’s current computing environment."
670,"Military housing officials told us that  activities to monitor the physical condition of housing units generally  include reviewing sample work order requests, following up with a sample  of residents to check on their experience with recently completed work,  and inspecting housing units during the change-of-occupancy process.
DOD Uses Several  Metrics to Monitor Private  Partner Performance, but  the Indicators Underlying  Those Metrics Do Not  Provide Meaningful  Information on the  Condition of Privatized  Housing The military departments each use a range of project-specific  performance metrics to monitor private partner performance, but as we  note in our draft report, the metrics designed to focus on resident  satisfaction and on the quality of the maintenance conducted on housing  units do not provide meaningful information or reflect the actual condition  of the housing units.
While data from these work order tracking systems may be  useful for point-in-time assessments of work order volume at a given  installation, military department officials told us that efforts are underway  to monitor work order data to increase the military departments’ oversight  and the accountability of the private partners for providing quality  housing."
671,"Although DOL collects limited data on the prevalence  of executive retirement plans, public companies subject to SEC reporting  requirements for executive retirement plans must report the benefits  provided to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer  (CFO), and the next three most highly compensated executive  officers.
According to Treasury officials and some industry experts, by participating  in an executive retirement plan, executives may be able to effectively  reduce their potential federal income tax liability during the deferral period  because investment earnings on associated plan assets are taxed at the  company’s corporate rate that may be lower than the executive’s  individual tax rate.
The Pension Protection  Act of 2006 amended the IRC to provide that, during a restricted period,  which includes bankruptcy, if a company that sponsors a qualified single- employer defined benefit plan sets aside or reserves assets in a trust for  the purposes of paying nonqualified deferred compensation (which  includes executive retirement plan compensation) to applicable covered  employees (key executives), the key executives are required to include  the amount of assets in their gross income for the taxable year.
IRS may be able to use  the timely, non-confidential information PBGC possesses to help IRS  identify whether companies with single-employer defined benefit plans  are setting aside assets for the purpose of paying deferred compensation  under an executive retirement plan during a restricted period.
Without providing specific  instruction to its examiners to collect and evaluate information that  describes company actions relative to this requirement limiting tax  deferral for key executives for amounts deferred under an executive  retirement plan and set aside by the company during a restricted period,  IRS cannot sufficiently determine if companies are including these  amounts in the executives’ gross income as required by the IRC  provision.
GAO continues to  maintain that implementing this recommendation will help ensure that IRS  is aware of when companies with at-risk single-employer defined benefit  plans are reporting assets set aside to pay deferred compensation to key  executives while in a restricted period as income for those employees."
672,"According to OCFO  officials, DOE discontinued the use of statistical sampling to produce  estimates in fiscal year 2012 because it was not required to do so, due to  DOE’s determination that it was at low risk for significant improper  payments.
Specifically, without documenting its rationale for the variable scale used  to score risk factors and weighting of the payment reporting sites, and  consideration of the known lag in identifying the extent of total improper  payments each fiscal year to support the development of its department- level risk assessment, DOE cannot demonstrate that its process for  determining its low risk of susceptibility to significant improper payments  is reasonable.
By developing, documenting, and implementing policies and procedures  to require OCFO to review documentation supporting payment site risk  assessments and define the process for overriding their risk  determinations, DOE would enhance its ability to adequately monitor its  decentralized improper payment risk assessment process and help  ensure the accuracy and reliability of payment reporting sites’ risk  assessments and DOE’s assessment of overall risk of susceptibility to  improper payments.
Audits and assessments of DOE’s contractors can identify  questioned costs that require additional review before they are either  allowed or deemed improper, but DOE has not consistently resolved  questioned costs in a timely manner because the OCFO does not direct  payment reporting sites to document policies for tracking questioned  costs to resolution.
(Recommendation 6) The Office of the Chief Financial Officer should revise DOE’s department- level process for conducting improper payment risk assessments to  include (1) developing and documenting the rationale for the variable  scale used to score risk factors and weighting of the payment reporting  sites; and (2) documenting DOE’s consideration of the inherent risk  associated with the lag in identifying certain improper payments  subsequent to the fiscal year they occurred to ensure that the process  results in a reliable assessment of whether the department is susceptible  to significant improper payments.
DOE did not concur with our seventh recommendation to (1) develop and  document the rationale for weighting risk factors, including the weighting  of all payment reporting sites; and (2) document its consideration of the  inherent risk associated with the lag in identifying certain improper  payments subsequent to the fiscal year they occurred to ensure that the  process results in a reliable assessment of whether the agency is  susceptible to significant improper payments."
673,"Public Reporting on Taxpayer  Experience In addition to surveying customers, OMB’s Circular A-11 section 280  establishes government-wide guiding principles for all executive branch  agencies which contain the following requirement: “Agency annual  performance plans should include indicators for outcomes related to  customer experience.” Our review of IRS’s congressional budget  justification and performance plan and report for fiscal year 2020 found no  performance measures or indicators summarizing the only taxpayer experience information that IRS collects on one of its online services—the  “View Your Account Information” survey discussed above.
The three foreign revenue agencies reviewed all report to their  parliaments on the extent to which they believe their online services are  meeting taxpayer needs and use that information to help target areas for  improvement: Australia: The Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) annual reports for  2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 tracked “community  satisfaction with ATO performance,” which combined more specific  measures tracking satisfaction with different service channels—online,  telephone, and mail—and satisfaction levels among different groups  of taxpayers, such as individuals and small businesses.
To help IRS officials and policy  makers measure the progress they are making in achieving their goal of  reducing taxpayer burden, IRS’s Research, Applied Analytics, and  Statistics (RAAS) office has periodically surveyed taxpayers since 1984  about the time and money they spend to complete their tax obligations  and uses the responses along with information from those taxpayers’ tax  returns to estimate the total compliance burden for individual taxpayers.
To do this, IRS proposes  to develop new services including delivering taxpayer notices  electronically, modernizing online installment agreements, and  establishing omni-channel communication capabilities provided that IRS  continues to receive the requested resources from Congress.
The modernization plan  also states that IRS will measure taxpayer burden hours, which would  capture changes in the amount of time taxpayers spend doing their taxes  as a result of the modernization of information services and the  development of new online services.
The survey  for this index score is administered by researchers outside the  government and focuses on taxpayers’ experiences filing their tax return,  which is not a service offered on irs.gov, making it of little use in  assessing taxpayer satisfaction with IRS’s online services.
Long-Standing Agreement  with Private Industry  Complicates IRS’s Ability  to Expand Online  Services, Including Filing  Amended Tax Returns  Electronically Taxpayers cannot file their tax returns on irs.gov and IRS officials told us  they have no plans to develop such a capability.
IRS is currently constrained in providing the online services that are part  of its long-term plans for taxpayers, including allowing electronic filing of  amended tax returns.
IRS agreed with our recommendations to ensure that information is  collected on taxpayers’ experiences with online services, ensure that  such information is summarized in IRS’s performance plan and report,  analyze the potential effects of online services on taxpayer burden,  include taxpayer input in its identification and prioritization of new online  services, ensure that planned future capabilities of digital communication  platforms are tested or piloted, and ensure that future decisions regarding  renewal of the Free File agreement incorporate findings from a  comprehensive examination of the benefits and costs of the agreement  as it relates to long term plans for IRS’s online services."

(Recommendation 1) The Secretary of the Army should ensure that the Deputy Chief of Staff,  G-3/5/7 conduct a comprehensive risk assessment associated with  staffing, equipping, and training the 915th Cyber Warfare Support  Battalion prior to approving the expansion of the unit to its full operational  capability.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of the Army should ensure that the Deputy Chief of Staff,  G-3/5/7 assess the risk associated with staffing, equipping, and training of  new units that it plans to activate in an accelerated manner for the  purposes of conducting multi-domain operations, taking into consideration  the assessments performed on the first activated ICEWS battalion and  the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion."
675,"In accordance  with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  recommendations, VHA policy requires providers to offer a one-time test  to all veterans; annual tests to veterans with known higher risk factors for  acquiring the virus, such as injection drug use; and tests every 3 months  to veterans with known higher risk factors who are prescribed preventive  medication known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
Officials from multiple VAMCs in our review stated their providers use  information technology solutions, such as clinical reminders, to fulfill their  requirements related to the first stage of HIV screening: offering HIV tests  to veterans, obtaining veterans’ verbal consent to be tested, and ordering  the most current recommended HIV test."
676,"SBDCs help SBA by  conducting local outreach to disaster victims; assisting those who have had their business loan application denied  or withdrawn with applications for reconsideration or re-acceptance; assisting declined applicants in remedying issues that initially  precluded loan approvals; and providing business loan applicants with technical assistance, including  to reconstruct business records, to better understand requirements to  complete a loan application, and for compiling financial statements  and collecting required documents.
For example, SBA’s major planning documentation does not  include any discussion of steps taken by ODA to mitigate the risk to the  program posed by the major infrastructure damage that occurred in  Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.
Outreach Methods According to SBA officials, SBA relied on public information officers, staff  at recovery centers, local partners such as SBDCs and local government,  and media contacts to disseminate information about the Disaster Loan  Program to disaster survivors.
When communicating with disaster  survivors was difficult immediately after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto  Rico, SBA officials told us they worked with the only operational radio  station on the island to broadcast information about the program.
Disaster loan applicants, SBA  resource partners, and SBA officials identified challenges that affected  application or review processes, including burdensome documentation  requests and translation issues.
The small business owners and SBDC officials with whom we  spoke in Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands  generally were unaware of the SBA Express Bridge Loan Program.
According to officials of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity,  following Hurricane Irma the program received 1,167 applications, of  which 883 were approved, totaling $35 million in disaster bridge financing.
For the fifth recommendation to evaluate the implementation of the  Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program to determine why so few loans have  been made and if any design changes may be warranted before the end  of the pilot (which could include assessing SBA’s outreach efforts and  seeking feedback from lenders), SBA described some actions it planned  to take in response to the recommendation that would partially address it.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology Our objectives were to examine the Small Business Administration’s  (SBA) (1) planning for and initial response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,  and Maria (hereinafter referred to as the 2017 hurricanes); (2) loan  application and review process (including changes since Hurricane  Katrina in 2005), timeliness, and approval rates; and (3) implementation  of the Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program.
To evaluate SBA’s loan application and review process, we reviewed  prior GAO and SBA OIG reports on SBA’s Disaster Loan Program to help  identify changes SBA made since Hurricane Katrina in 2005."
677,"TRANSCOM’s preliminary cost estimates for the current DP3 and for the  activities that will be a part of the Global Household Goods Contract  included costs associated with the movement and storage of household  goods and government personnel costs associated with the military  services’ personal property processing and shipping offices.
(Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, should ensure that the TRANSCOM Commander develop  performance metrics for those DP3 activities that will not be a part of the  Global Household Goods Contract, such as servicemember counseling  and claims resolution that will, at least in part, continue to be performed  by the military services."
678,"The project manager,  with support from the cross-functional team, is responsible for preparing a  proposal for the pilot that includes key information, such as the pilot’s  objectives and performance measures, and overseeing pilot  implementation and communication with key stakeholders.
However, addressing gaps between  USPS’s policies and leading practices related to linking objectives and  performance measures, documenting conclusions, and communicating  with key external stakeholders would enable USPS leadership to better  assess the outcomes of its pilots, understand the rationale for conclusions  about scalability based on pilot results, and gauge customers’ reactions to  innovative products and services.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following two recommendations to USPS:  The Postmaster General should direct the Vice President of Product  Innovation to develop policies that fully reflect leading practices for pilot  design and evaluation in areas such as linking objectives and  performance measures; documenting conclusions about scalability based  on pilot results; and communicating with key external stakeholders, as  appropriate."
679,"However, MDA has opportunities to mitigate these  challenges by collectively prioritizing its threat assessment requests and  working through existing venues with the defense intelligence community  to determine what additional resources may be needed to secure the  accelerated support that it needs.
This upsurge of threat missile activity increases the urgency for the  defense intelligence community to provide the requisite type of threat  assessments to MDA to enable the agency to counter and defeat such  threats; however, defense intelligence community officials have said that  manpower and resource constraints have limited their ability to do so.
Request for Accelerated  Delivery of Threat Modules Moving forward, MDA has asked the defense intelligence community to  provide the digitized threat modules on an accelerated schedule to  ensure the agency can compile BMDS VOLT reports in a timely manner  to inform its acquisition decisions; however, some defense intelligence  production centers have said that an accelerated schedule will be difficult,  if not impossible, without additional manpower and resources.
Although the defense intelligence community is  uniquely positioned to assist MDA in addressing these challenges, the  agency generally limits the defense intelligence community’s insight into  and input on critical threat-related BMDS acquisition processes and  decisions, such as establishing the BMDS threat space and assigning  threat parameters and threat models to BMDS elements.
(Recommendation 1) The Director, MDA should fully engage the defense intelligence  community on key threat-related missile defense acquisition processes  and decisions, including providing insight into and obtaining input from the  defense intelligence community on the threat space MDA establishes for  the BMDS and the threat parameters and threat models MDA assigns to  BMDS elements as design requirements and test cases."
680,"One  difference between the agricultural credit needs of tribal members and  other producers is that tribal members may have a greater unmet need  for long-term loans, which are typically secured by real estate, because of  difficulties in using tribal lands as collateral, as discussed later in this  report.
According to tribal stakeholders, experts, and BIA officials we interviewed,  tribal members who obtain agricultural credit likely receive it from USDA’s  Farm Service Agency, other USDA programs, or Native CDFIs. Some  tribal members receive agricultural credit from local private lenders, but  they are typically larger, more established borrowers.
While BIA generally allows  leased tribal trust and restricted fee lands to be subject to a leasehold  mortgage, three tribal stakeholders and experts we interviewed said  that BIA’s maximum term for agricultural leases often was insufficient  for obtaining an agricultural loan.
Of the 11 FCS associations we contacted with tribal lands in their  territories, some reported that they had recently made loans to Indian  tribes or their members, and their outreach to these populations included  support for agricultural education.
According to two tribal stakeholders we interviewed, Indian tribes or tribal  members who received loans from FCS or other commercial lenders may  have larger agricultural operations, a longer credit history, and property  that can be more easily used as collateral.
In addition, stakeholders discussed the following tribal  actions that could increase credit access for tribes and their members: Representatives of two FCS associations noted that waivers of  sovereign immunity (limited to specific contracts) by tribes may  increase lending involving tribal lands, as it helps to enable  lenders to enforce the terms of loans made to tribes."
681,"The Air Force’s assessment of internal control and Statement of  Assurance are not clearly supported by completed test plans or other  documented monitoring activities because SAF/FM does not have a  policy or procedures for conducting internal control assessments that  require documented test plans that (1) tie back to specific objectives  included in the Business Operations Plan; (2) specify the nature, scope,  and timing of procedures to conduct under the OMB Circular No. A-123  assessment process; and (3) reflect a consideration of prior year self- identified control deficiencies and results of other internal and external  audits.
For example, AFI 65-201 and the Statement of Assurance  Handbook provided to unit managers for conducting internal control  assessments, and the Internal Control Playbook that the Air Force  developed in August 2019 to address internal control over reporting  objectives, do not include the complete definitions of the four material  weakness categories for deficiencies related to (1) operations, (2)  reporting, (3) external financial reporting, and (4) compliance objectives,  consistent with guidance in OMB Circular No. A-123.
Further, SAF/FM did not document its approach for using results from the  AFAA agreed-upon procedures in assessing the Air Force’s internal  control over processes related to mission-critical assets because the Air  Force did not provide guidance establishing the process and reporting  lines of all the sources of information that it considered in preparing its  overall Statement of Assurance."
682,"Specifically, we found that Education and VA developed  corrective actions corresponding to each root cause of improper  payments identified for fiscal year 2018 in Education’s Direct Loan and  Pell Grant programs and VA’s PSAS, respectively.
Although the scope of our review focused on processes in place for  fiscal year 2018, we found that the updated procedures, if effectively  implemented, will address our concerns because they include control  activities designed to help ensure that corrective actions that SSA  develops and implements correspond to the identified root causes of  improper payments, as directed by OMB guidance.
As previously  discussed, USDA and Treasury did not develop agency corrective actions  corresponding to the identified root causes of improper payments for their  selected programs and therefore did not establish planned related  completion dates, monitor progress, or measure the effectiveness of such  corrective actions.
USDA: As previously discussed, FNS did not develop corrective  actions at the agency level to address SNAP’s root causes of  improper payments and, as a result, did not have planned completion  dates for such corrective actions.
In addition, USDA and  Treasury did not develop agency corrective actions corresponding to the  identified root causes of improper payments for their selected programs  and therefore did not measure the effectiveness of such corrective  actions.
As part of these procedures, HHS should include processes for (1)  establishing planned completion dates, (2) monitoring the progress of  implementing corrective actions, and (3) measuring the effectiveness of  improper payment corrective actions.
USDA stated that FNS has agency-level  corrective actions that correspond to the identified root causes and  establishes planned completion dates, monitors the progress, and  measures the effectiveness of SNAP’s corrective actions."
683,"Some of the controls that NIST  recommends are access controls—authentication requirements and physical access  controls to limit or detect inappropriate access to data, equipment,  and facilities; security management controls—establish a framework and  continuous cycle for assessing data systems for security weaknesses,  implementing security procedures, and monitoring the procedures to  ensure adequate protection of sensitive or critical resources; and contingency planning and restoration of services—planning for  how to provide continued or restored services when system  interruptions or problems occur.
Total Obligations  Were Consistent  across Recent Years  for Both  Telecommunications  and Call Center  Contracts; Data on  Subcontracting and  Offshoring Are  Limited Federal Obligations for  Telecommunications  Averaged $6 Billion  Annually Federal agencies reported obligating a total of over $30 billion to acquire  telecommunications products and services during fiscal years 2014  through 2018.
For example: The GSA Networx services contract and the DISA contract for DOD  Information Network operations include requirements to ensure that  covered contractor employees are to be paid wages at least at the  federal minimum wage rate.
The CMS call center operations contract also includes an HHS- specific requirement related to salary rate limitations that specifies  that the contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary  of an individual at a rate that exceeds the Federal Executive Schedule  Level II in effect on the date the funding was obligated.
Selected  Telecommunications  and Call Center  Contracts Included  Data Protection and  System Security  Requirements The five selected contracts we reviewed include examples of various  safeguards—such as limiting access to data systems and data, system  management controls, contingency planning and restoration of services,  and restrictions on the use of equipment—to protect data systems and  personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and use."
684,"MHS Workforces and the  Role of MTFs in  Supporting Military  Readiness In fiscal year 2019, DOD’s Defense Health Program-funded workforce  numbered over 174,000 personnel, comprising active-duty  servicemembers from each military department (the Army, the Navy, and  the Air Force), federal civilian employees of DOD, and private-sector  contractors.
Other MHS Reforms and  Prior GAO Work In recent years, DOD leaders have taken steps to refocus the MTFs as  platforms for sustaining high-quality combat casualty care and the  operational readiness of active-duty medical providers while increasing  efficiency, in part by responding to congressional mandates.
The 703 Work Group  Evaluated MTFs’ Support  for Military Readiness,  Nearby Civilian Health  Care, and Cost- Effectiveness, and  Documented This  Approach and Its Results In reviewing the 703 Work Group’s methodology for determining MTF  restructuring actions, we found that the group prioritized cross-cutting  elements from 10 U.S.C.
Specifically, the Work Group (1) conducted limited  assessments of MTFs’ readiness support to military primary care and  nonphysician medical providers, and did not include, as part of its  methodology, (2) complete and accurate data about the quality of and  access to purchased care from civilian providers, or (3) alternative  assumptions that could affect the perceived cost-effectiveness of MTF- provided direct care.
DOD’s assessments were missing complete and accurate information  about the adequacy of purchased care through civilian health care  providers because 703 Work Group officials stated that their analyses  were detailed enough for the purposes of decision-making about  restructuring.
While  this will be a positive step, a better understanding of the quality of civilian  health care providers and patients’ access to an adequate supply of such  providers within drive-time standards could help DOD in its  implementation planning for MTF transitions and its tests of network  capabilities by illustrating areas of highest risk.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following six recommendations to DOD:  The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with the Surgeons General of  the military departments and the Director of the DHA, consistently collect  complete and accurate information about the quality of available civilian  health care in proximity to its MTFs (such as ratings from the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services and perceptions from MTF officials who  regularly coordinate with civilian providers, among other means) and  assess that information to inform recommendations for future MTF  restructuring decisions.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with the Surgeons General of  the military departments and the Director of the DHA, consistently collect  complete and accurate information about the extent to which non-network  civilian health care providers that could be incorporated into the TRICARE  network meet access-to-care standards in terms of drive time, and assess  that information to inform recommendations on future MTF restructuring  decisions."
685,"OMB directs federal agencies,  including DOD and the military services, to develop, among other  things, civilian personnel budget requests by calculating workload  requirements, the time needed to complete the workload and the  number of FTEs needed to perform the work for the upcoming fiscal  year.
DCHR provides program direction, technical advice, guidance and  assistance to major subordinate commands, Headquarters Marine  Corps staff agencies, and servicing human capital resource offices in  carrying out Manage to Payroll responsibilities, with regard to position  classification.
The DOD Inspector General’s report stated that the Marine Corps did not  determine civilian pay funding levels using FTEs calculated from  projected hours to be worked, as directed in Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) Circular A-11."
686,"States reported that they relied on CCDF funding most frequently for the  following activities: child care resource and referral systems, consumer  education, and health and safety standards establishment and training.
Officials in the states we interviewed described various  ways in which their child care resource and referral agencies support  child care providers and parents, such as: Delivering professional development, including training and technical  assistance, to child care providers, regardless of whether or not the  providers accept subsidized children, according to several CCDF  administrators interviewed."
687,"GSA’s 2014 Bulletin states that GSA will review the adequacy of the  requesting agency’s organizational structure and staffing proposed for the  delegation; and whether the requesting agency has complied with all  applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, OMB Circulars, and  reporting requirements under previously authorized delegated leases.
Absent procedures to regularly track the performance of agencies with  delegated leasing authority to ensure cost effectiveness and limit the use  of extensions, holdovers, and standstill agreements, GSA cannot ensure  that these agencies are meeting the management goals of the delegated  leasing program.
However, GSA officials said that they do not have a process in place to  systematically review post award documents from delegated leases to  determine whether the lease awarded met program requirements and  were within the authority granted in the approval letter."
688,"In general, current law requires that an EAS carrier  provide the following:  service to a hub airport, defined as an FAA-designated medium- or  large-hub airport;  two daily round trips, 6 days a week, with not more than one  intermediate stop to the hub;  flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of  passengers with connecting flights and at prices that are not  excessive compared to prices of other air carriers for like service  between similar places;  service in an aircraft with an effective capacity of at least 15  passengers, under certain circumstances, unless the affected  community agrees in writing to the use of smaller air craft;  service in an aircraft with at least two engines and using two pilots;  and  service with pressurized aircraft under certain circumstances.
In October 2014, DOT issued a Notice of Enforcement Policy stating  that it would start enforcing the annual subsidy-per-passenger cap of  $200 for communities located less than 210 miles from a medium- or  large-hub airport after September 30, 2015, thereby limiting the  number of communities eligible for EAS in 2016.
We also identified two statutory changes since 2010 that increased the  flexibility of air carriers’ operations for the EAS program, and one that  automatically grants waivers for the $200 subsidy-per-passenger cap to  communities that meet certain requirements.
An official from one carrier said that factors such as the increasing  costs for pilots and an insufficient number of aircraft operating with  less than 50 seats make it difficult for a community airport to comply  with the $200 subsidy-per-passenger cap."
689,"State and Commerce  Have Provided  Guidance and  Conducted Outreach,  but Universities  Expressed Concerns  about Their Adequacy  for Addressing  University-Specific  Issues State’s DDTC and Commerce’s BIS have developed export compliance- related guidance and conducted outreach to support all exporters’  understanding of and compliance with the regulations.
The ITAR and the EAR  regulations apply to all exporters, whether universities, private entities,  non-profits, or government entities, and according to DDTC and BIS  officials, the guidance and outreach materials they have developed are  similarly applicable to all potential exporting entities, including  universities.
DDTC and BIS have also developed guidance that provides specific  instructions or tools for complying with the agencies’ regulations,  including export compliance guidelines (see below for more information  about these guidelines) and decision tools for classifying items subject to  the ITAR and the EAR.
For example,  DDTC and BIS participate in an annual conference affiliated with the  Association of University Export Control Officers, where agency officials  discuss topics such as regulatory updates, license statistics, and export  compliance best practices.
Specifically, university and association officials  identified the following three challenges working with and obtaining  guidance from these agencies: (1) federal agencies are developing  different requirements for reporting financial conflicts of interest to  address foreign influence issues, (2) some agencies provide briefings and  other forms of guidance related to export controls and foreign threats that  do not sufficiently address universities’ needs, and (3) DOD officials  inconsistently interpret export control regulations and misunderstand what  constitutes fundamental research.
For example, an interagency working group  established by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy  and individual federal agencies are undertaking efforts to address  university concerns regarding inconsistent financial conflict of interest  reporting requirements and the lack of relevant, university-specific  resources to address threats identified by some agencies.
Universities Cited a Lack  of University-Specific  Resources for Addressing  Threats Identified by  Some Agencies as a  Challenge Agencies such as the FBI, DHS, BIS’s Office of Export Enforcement, and  DOD’s Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency provide  briefings and other forms of guidance related to export controls and  foreign threats.
Moreover, another university official  stated that if export control officers cannot share relevant threat  information with the university’s administration because of  classification issues, the university may not get the resources it needs  to improve its compliance programs and properly comply with export  control regulations.
Universities Identified  DOD Officials’ Inconsistent  Interpretation of Export  Control Regulations as a  Challenge, and DOD’s  Planned Actions Will Not  Fully Address the Issue Officials from multiple universities and associations stated that DOD  officials inconsistently interpret export control regulations and  misunderstand the term fundamental research and its implications when  providing funding for university research, which some officials said leads  to confusion, results in contract delays, and may limit universities’ ability  to conduct research for DOD.
(Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Commerce should ensure that the Under Secretary for  Industry and Security, in consultation with university representatives,  provides additional or revises existing guidance and outreach to address  university-specific export control issues to further support universities’  understanding and compliance with the Export Administration  Regulations.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology Our report examines (1) the extent to which the Departments of State  (State) and Commerce (Commerce) have provided guidance and  outreach that supports U.S. universities’ understanding of and compliance  with both agencies’ export control regulations, (2) export control-related  challenges that U.S. universities face while working with or obtaining  guidance from other federal agencies, and (3) the extent to which export  compliance policies and practices developed by U.S. universities align  with State’s and Commerce’s export compliance guidelines.
Seven of the nine universities we visited stated  that they provide export control-related trainings to researchers and  other officials involved in the implementation of export control  regulations."
690,"FASAB defines an insurance program as “a general  term used to refer to a program that is authorized by law to financially  compensate a designated population of beneficiaries by accepting all or  part of the risk for losses incurred as a result of an adverse event.” In  addition to activities that may fall under the FASAB definition of  insurance, the federal government undertakes other activities that  compensate or provide benefits to individuals or other third parties that  suffer losses from an adverse event.
In addition, Congress created the  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to address the increasing cost  of federal disaster assistance by providing flood insurance to property  owners in flood-prone areas, where such insurance either was not  available or prohibitively expensive through the private sector.
We  broadly categorize the federal activities that met our criteria as follows:  federal insurance programs; federal loan guarantee programs; senior  preferred stock purchase agreements with two government-sponsored  enterprises (enterprises), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; federal employee  and veterans benefits (excluding education benefits and burial benefits);  and other activities, such as those that provide property damage or  financial loss compensation and those that offer life, health, or disability  benefits to nonfederal employees.
While there is no universally accepted definition of  what constitutes a federal insurance program, federal agencies have  reported insurance and guarantee liabilities and related note disclosures  in the Financial Report for the following programs: Department of  Agriculture, Risk Management Agency’s (RMA) Federal Crop Insurance  Program; Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency  Management Agency’s (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program  (NFIP); Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s (PBGC) single-employer  and multiemployer pension insurance programs; Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) deposit insurance program; and National  Credit Union Administration’s (NCUA) share insurance program.
Many of these benefit  programs exchange current services for a guarantee of lifetime annuity  payments or the continuation of health insurance coverage, inherently  transferring at least part of the risk of an adverse experience—such as  people living longer than expected, or health care costs rising faster than  expected—from the employees to the federal government.
Table 5 has information on the budget accounts we found with more than  $10 billion in total new obligations for fiscal year 2017 that funded  activities that transferred risk or losses to the federal government.
Budget Cost  Recognition of  Certain Federal  Activities That  Transfer Risk or  Losses to the  Government Presents  Challenges In our previous work, we found challenges in relation to measuring and  reporting fiscal exposures caused by certain federal activities, including  federal insurance programs.
First, we identified certain categories of federal activities that met our  criteria using the note disclosures of the 2017 Financial Report: We identified the following federal insurance programs by analyzing  the note disclosure on federal insurance and guarantee liabilities as  well as our internal audit documents on that note disclosure for fiscal  years 2014–2017: Federal Crop Insurance Program, National Flood  Insurance Program (NFIP), Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s   (PBGC) single-employer and multiemployer pension insurance  programs, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Deposit Insurance  Fund, and National Credit Union Administration’s Share Insurance  Fund."
691,"OCRD collaborates with the Office of Human Capital and Talent  Management (HCTM) to develop and implement recruitment strategies  intended to support a diverse and well-qualified workforce; consults with  agency officials such as the Executive Diversity Council; partners with  USAID employee resource groups to extend outreach opportunities and  develop strategies of inclusion within USAID; and addresses allegations  of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.
As table 5 shows, our descriptive analysis of the data for USAID’s Foreign  Service found that for Class 4 and higher ranks, a lower average  percentage of racial or ethnic minorities than of whites was promoted  from each rank except Class 1.
Our adjusted analysis of the data for USAID’s Foreign Service, controlling  for certain factors other than racial or ethnic minority status that could  influence promotion, found that racial or ethnic minorities had lower  adjusted rates and odds of promotion than their white counterparts but  that these differences were generally not statistically significant.
Civil Service Average  Promotion Rates Varied  for Women Relative to  Men, but Differences in  Outcomes Were Not  Statistically Significant  When We Controlled for  Various Factors As table 6 shows, our descriptive analysis of USAID data on promotions  in fiscal years 2002 through 2017 found that the rate of promotion in  USAID’s Civil Service was generally lower for women than for men at GS- 13 and lower ranks.
For this report, we analyzed National Finance Center data on USAID’s  full-time, permanent, career workforce (direct-hire U.S. citizen Civil and  Foreign Service employees) for fiscal years 2002 through 2018.
Appendix II: USAID Workforce Data, Fiscal  Years 2002-2018 The following figures and tables present numbers and proportions of  employees in racial, ethnic, and gender groups in the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) overall and in USAID’s Civil and  Foreign Services in fiscal years 2002 through 2018.
Appendix VI: Workforce Data on Individuals  with Disabilities at USAID Table 25 shows the proportions of permanent employees with a disability  in the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Civil and  Foreign Services in fiscal years 2009 through 2017.
The following figures and tables present the numbers and proportions of  newly hired employees in racial, ethnic, and gender groups in USAID  overall and USAID’s Civil Service and Foreign Service in fiscal years  2003 through 2018.

692,"For  example, if an agency publishes a financial report and conducts a risk  assessment and determines that none of its programs or activities are  susceptible to significant improper payments, then the remaining criteria  would not be applicable.
Appendix III provides information on all  the programs that had a substantial change in estimated improper  payments between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and the reasons for  those changes as reported in agency AFRs. Examples of substantial  changes in improper payments and the reasons for such changes that  agencies provided in their AFRs include the following: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported an  increase in the total estimated improper payments for the  Medicaid program in excess of $21.1 billion for fiscal year 2019."
693,"In June 2018, we recommended that the F-35 program identify what  steps it needs to take to ensure the F-35 aircraft meet R&M requirements  before each variant reaches maturity and update its R&M Improvement  Program (RMIP)—DOD’s action plan for prioritizing and funding R&M  improvement projects—with these steps.
The F-35 Program Office’s  Improvement Plan Does  Not Address Under- Performing Metrics The F-35 program office has estimated that implementing all of the  identified improvement projects currently contained in its RMIP could  result in potential life cycle cost savings of over $9.2 billion by improving  the F-35’s R&M.
The F- 35 program plans to award Block 4 development contracts starting in May  2019, before completing a business case—a baseline cost and schedule  estimate to track the program’s performance going forward.
The F-35 Program Is  Transitioning to Early  Block 4 Development and  Testing The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required  DOD to submit a report containing certain elements of an acquisition  program baseline—in essence, a full program business case—to include  the cost, schedule, and performance information for Block 4.
According to program officials, as of December 2018, the  program has executed contract actions valued over $1.4 billion to  establish testing facilities and support early Block 4 development of  capabilities the program plans to deliver through 2024.
According to CAPE  officials, they will provide the independent cost estimate between  October and December 2019 to support the program’s full-rate  production decision, but this would occur several months after the  program plans to award the Block 4 development contracts.
According to best practices  identified by GAO, without several of the business case documents  completed, program officials cannot have a high level of confidence that  the requirements are firm and that the risk to committing an estimated  $10.5 billion in funding to Block 4 has been adequately reduced.
(Recommendation 4) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the F-35 program office  completes its business case, at least for the initial Block 4 capabilities  under development, before initiating additional development work, to  include: an independent cost estimate; an approved test and evaluation  master plan which addresses resources, aircraft shortfalls, and funding;  and an independent technology readiness assessment."
694,"The MDH Program  Differs from Other  Medicare Rural  Hospital Payment  Designations in Terms  of Eligibility Criteria,  Financial Benefit,  Legislative  Permanence, and  Relative Size In addition to the MDH designation, four other rural hospital designations  exist: (1) critical access hospitals (CAH), (2) sole community hospitals  (SCH), (3) low-volume adjustment hospitals (LVA), and (4) rural referral  centers (RRC).
Our review of CMS documentation shows that the MDH  payment designation differs from the other rural payment designations in  terms of eligibility criteria, financial benefit, extent of legislative  permanence, and size—that is, the number of hospitals receiving the  designation.
(See figures 6 and 7.) To obtain additional context on the relationship between MDH eligibility  criteria and the various measures of Medicare dependence, we ran  regression models to identify the extent to which hospitals’ bed size and  rural status were associated with the Medicare share of days, discharges,  and total care revenue for all hospitals from fiscal years 2011 through  2017."
695,"Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology Section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2017, as amended, included a provision that we report on the  number of instances where Department of Defense (DOD) used the  lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) process for contracts  exceeding $5 million, as well as provide an explanation of how acquisition  officials considered the new criteria in making a determination to use the  LPTA process.
This report, which addresses both provisions, describes (1) the  status of regulatory changes required by the defense and civilian  provisions for using the LPTA process and (2) the extent to which DOD  and selected civilian agencies used the LPTA process to competitively  award contracts and orders valued at $5 million or more in fiscal year  2018, and what they bought using this process."
696,"In  our May 2019 report, we made separate recommendations to the Army,  the Navy, and the Coast Guard to consider the feasibility, to include the  benefits and drawbacks, of collecting and maintaining complete  information for all nonjudicial punishment cases in one of the military  service’s databases, such as information on the servicemembers’ race,  ethnicity, gender, offense, and punishment imposed.
We could not determine disparities in case outcomes—convictions and  punishment severity—in the Coast Guard’s general and special courts- martial for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 because the Coast Guard did  not collect and maintain complete conviction and punishment data in its  military justice database."
697,"NOAA’s Regional Integrated Science Assessments (RISA) program and  the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) worked with  utilities and EPA, through an effort called the Water Utility Climate  Alliance which aims to enhance the quality and accessibility of regional  climate change data to help improve water resource planning, develop  adaptation strategies, and assist overall decision-making for water-related  policies.
Further, EPA officials said that while the agency has collaborated closely  with key federal, state, and local decision makers; industry groups; and  utilities in its role as chair of the Water Sector Government Coordinating  Council, the council has focused on other short-term threats to utilities,  such as disasters and terrorism, and has not assessed how it could  develop and coordinate a network to effectively provide the technical  assistance that utilities need to enhance their climate resilience.
By  identifying and engaging existing technical assistance providers in a  network to help drinking water and wastewater utilities incorporate climate  resilience into their projects and planning on an ongoing basis, EPA  would have more reasonable assurance that climate information was  effectively exchanged among federal agencies and infrastructure owners  and operators.
According to  EPA, FEMA, HUD, and USDA officials we interviewed, drinking water and  wastewater utilities can use financial assistance from their programs to  pay for projects that, in addition to other benefits, can help enhance  climate resilience.
Representatives of several of the drinking water and wastewater utilities  we reviewed reported using selected federal financial assistance  programs to help fund projects for fiscal years 2011 through 2018 that, in  addition to other benefits, enhanced their climate resilience.
Several of the selected utilities said that a federal requirement for  potential climate impacts to be considered and, if necessary, incorporated  into the design of all new drinking water and wastewater infrastructure  projects that receive federal financial assistance, would be moderately to  extremely effective in helping utilities enhance their resilience.
By identifying existing  technical assistance providers and engaging them in a network to help  drinking water and wastewater utilities consider climate resilience in the  planning and design of projects on an ongoing basis, EPA, as chair of the  Water Sector Government Coordinating Council, would have more  reasonable assurance that climate information was effectively exchanged  among federal agencies and infrastructure owners and operators.
In its written comments, EPA neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendation that the Administrator, as Chair of the Water Sector  Government Coordinating Council, should work with the council to identify  existing technical assistance providers and engage these providers in a  network to help drinking water and wastewater utilities incorporate climate  resilience into their projects and planning on an ongoing basis."
698,"USPS Efforts Have  Decreased Employee  Compensation Costs,  but USPS Has Not  Fully Assessed  Savings and Other  Costs USPS Estimates That  Decreasing Pay Rates for  New Employees and  Health Insurance  Contributions Have Saved  Billions In addition to decreasing the number of employees and work hours,  USPS also implemented three major changes to decrease employee  compensation: (1) lowering pay for new career employees, (2) increasing  use of non-career employees, and (3) reducing USPS contributions to  health insurance premiums for active employees.
These changes were  negotiated with the four unions representing the majority of postal  employees and established in CBAs. According to USPS management  officials, these actions were intended to decrease compensation costs  and increase workforce flexibility, which were necessary responses to  declining letter mail volume and revenue, growth in more labor-intensive  package volume, and increases in the number of delivery addresses.
When we accounted for these additional factors, we were  able to substantiate $8 billion, of USPS’s estimated $9.7 billion, in savings  over the last three fiscal years for changes to the number of non-career  employees and health insurance contributions.
When calculating the savings it achieved from using lower-paid  employees, USPS compared what it actually paid in compensation to  estimates of what it would have paid in the absence of having non-career  or lower-paid workers, using average pay rates and not individual level  employee data.
According to postal union officials and USPS OIG, decreases in pay and  lack of work schedule flexibility have resulted in some negative effects on  morale that increased turnover of non-career employees.
Our analysis shows that, based on fiscal year 2018 payroll data, if USPS  decreased the current mail carrier hours by one sixth, it could save up to  $2.6 billion in compensation costs.
Decreases to Healthcare Contributions: If USPS was able to decrease  its cost of health care payments for current employee coverage by 1  percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent, we estimate, based on fiscal year  2018 payroll data, the potential savings would be about $45 million, $224  million, and $449 million, respectively.
We estimated the potential annual  cost savings associated with USPS implementing cuts for all current  employee pay by 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent across all current  employees based on fiscal year 2018 payroll data.
USPS overestimated its cost savings from the employee  compensation changes because it did not include significant factors such  as tenure and mix of work hours when developing its estimates.
Recommendation for  Executive Action We are making the following recommendation to USPS:  The Postmaster General should direct executive leaders to develop  guidance for cost savings estimates related to employee compensation  specifying that analysis used to calculate estimates should, to the extent  possible, include significant factors, such as work hours, tenure, and  turnover."
699,"Government-Wide  Reviews and Internal  Studies of SSCs In recent years, we have reported concerns with federal agencies’ use of  SSCs. In December 2011, we found that while agencies increasingly  relied on contractors to provide professional and management support  services, agencies generally did not consider and mitigate risks of  acquiring such services, including the risk that contractors may  inappropriately influence the government’s authority, control, and  accountability for inherently governmental decisions.
Additionally, some of the information NNSA reported  was not fully useful to support congressional decision-making because it  did not present the cost of SSCs in terms of obligations for 1 fiscal year  and did not identify the specific appropriations accounts used to fund  SSCs. The NDAAs for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 require NNSA to report  annually certain information on its use of SSCs in its congressional  budget justification materials.
By reporting  information on all professional SSCs to which funds were obligated during  the fiscal year in its annual congressional budget justification materials,  NNSA could provide more complete information on the number of SSCs  used to meet mission requirements, assisting Congress in making better  informed decisions about NNSA’s annual appropriations levels.
Specifically, NNSA included statements in its annual congressional  budget justification materials for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 that the  agency does not have information to address this requirement and that it  is the responsibility of each individual contractor to determine who will  perform the scope of work required by the terms and conditions of each  contract.
However, some of the information is not fully  useful to support congressional decision-making because it presents  obligations for SSCs over multiple fiscal years, instead of presenting such  obligations annually, and does not identify the specific program’s  appropriation accounts, such as Weapons Activities and Defense Nuclear  Nonproliferation, used to fund the contracts, as required by the fiscal year  2017 NDAA.
Appendix I: Scope and Methodology This report examines the extent to which: (1) the National Nuclear  Security Administration (NNSA) used professional support service  contracts (SSC) in fiscal years 2010 through 2018, (2) the information  about SSCs in NNSA’s annual congressional budget justification  materials for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 is complete and useful to  support congressional decision-making, and (3) NNSA manages the  potential risks of SSCs that it determines are at high risk for providing  inherently governmental functions."
700,"Those stakeholders who believe that FTC’s current authority and  enforcement approach is unduly limited identified three main actions that  could better protect Internet privacy: (1) enactment of an overarching  federal privacy statute to establish general requirements governing  Internet privacy practices of all sectors, (2) APA section 553 notice-and- comment rulemaking authority, and (3) civil penalty authority for any  violation of a statutory or regulatory requirement, rather than allowing  penalties only for violations of settlement agreements or consent decrees  that themselves seek redress for a previous statutory or regulatory  violation."
701,"Federal laws establish  enforcement authority for state agencies over CRAs. Under FCRA and  the Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive  acts and practices, state Attorney General offices (or another official or  agency designated by the state) have certain enforcement authority over  some companies, including certain CRAs. However, states are required  to coordinate enforcement actions with CFPB and FTC.
For example, the three nationwide CRAs entered into two separate  settlements with 30 state Attorney General offices in 2015 in which the  CRAs agreed to implement a number of specific reforms, including  reforms related to consumer report accuracy and dispute processes.
New York’s financial regulator told us that state laws provide the  agency with supervisory, enforcement, and rulemaking authority over  institutions that provide financial products and services, including  certain CRAs. The agency issued a rule in 2018 requiring CRAs  reporting on consumers within the state to register with the agency  annually and provide information as required by the agency.
CFPB directed specific changes in some CRAs’ policies and procedures  for ensuring data accuracy and conducting dispute investigations,  including increasing oversight of incoming data from furnishers,  developing internal processes to monitor furnisher dispute responses to  detect those that may present higher risk of inaccurate data, and  enforcing the CRAs’ obligation to investigate consumer disputes,  including review of relevant information provided by consumers.
In a 2017 report, CFPB stated that it had found numerous furnisher  violations of FCRA and Regulation V related to data accuracy and dispute  investigations and that it directed furnishers to take corrective actions  (see table 5 for examples of CFPB’s supervisory findings and directed  actions).
For example, CFPB found that certain furnishers failed to  establish, implement, and maintain reasonable written policies and  procedures consistent with Regulation V regarding the accuracy and  integrity of the information furnished; provided information to CRAs  despite having reasonable cause to believe the information was  inaccurate; and lacked policies for their employees on how to conduct  reasonable investigation of consumer disputes.
For example, CFPB directed  furnishers to develop reasonable written policies and procedures  regarding accuracy, to promptly update the information provided to CRAs  after determining that the information was not complete or accurate, and  to update and implement policies and procedures to ensure disputes are  handled in accordance with FCRA requirements.
Neither the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of  2003 nor any other statutory provision within FCRA includes a similar provision for the agencies to establish and maintain guidelines or provide  information concerning supervisory expectations regarding the accuracy  of consumer data CRAs maintain, and CFPB has not established  guidelines or defined supervisory expectations for CRAs. Since 2015, CFPB’s long-term rulemaking agenda has stated that it will  evaluate possible policy responses to consumer reporting issues,  including potential additional rules or amendments to existing rules  governing consumer reporting accuracy and dispute processes.
CFPB staff said that a substantial body of case law exists to  guide CRAs regarding what practices may be considered compliant with  FCRA requirements, including with respect to provisions for reasonable  procedures for accuracy and performing reasonable dispute  investigations."
702,"Specifically, we found that (1) Treasury did not have sufficient  procedures to analyze and determine whether appropriate disclosures  related to new federal accounting standards were included in the draft  fiscal year 2018 Financial Report; (2) Treasury did not have sufficient  procedures to properly support and consistently report restatements,  reclassifications, and adjustments to beginning net position reported in  the draft fiscal year 2018 Financial Report; and (3) Treasury and OMB did  not have adequate processes and procedures for reporting appropriate  information regarding legal contingency losses in the fiscal year 2018  CFS.
Recommendation for Executive  Action We recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury should ensure that the  Fiscal Assistant Secretary develops and implements procedures to  enhance Treasury’s processes for reasonably assuring that the Financial  Report includes disclosures required by new federal accounting  standards, such as conducting an appropriate level of analysis to  determine whether disclosures are needed, consulting with technical  experts, and including additional details on these requirements in its  financial reporting disclosure checklists."
703,"According to Bureau officials, the Bureau’s  Census Open Innovation Labs is another important component that aims  to integrate these partnership activities and provide guidance at the  national and local levels on various strategies for messaging with  partners.
Using this index, the Bureau is able to monitor incoming census data for  those areas, such as response rates and hiring and recruitment numbers,  to see if efforts to reach hard-to-count areas are succeeding amid  challenging current events, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, which could  affect willingness of workers to participate in work taking them door-to- door to nonrespondents.
As the timing of this report coincides with ongoing implementation of the  self-response period and field enumeration operations, planned Bureau  evaluations and assessments will be best positioned to identify any  lessons learned and determine whether, in light of the challenges cited  above, the Bureau’s partnership and outreach efforts were successful in  maximizing participation in the census."

Freight Train Length  Has Increased, and  Railroads Identified  Advantages to  Operating Longer  Trains According to officials from all seven Class I freight railroads and  representatives from AAR, FRA, STB, and other stakeholders we  interviewed, freight train-length has increased in recent years; however,  the data are limited.
According to officials from FRA,  NTSB, railroad employee unions, and other stakeholders, longer mixed- freight trains may be more difficult to handle than unit trains in certain  circumstances due to variations in car length and weight and the extent to  which additional DP locomotives are employed.
State and local officials we spoke with, as  previously mentioned, expressed concerns about the potential for longer  trains to increase the number of blocked grade crossings, causing delays  for emergency responders and affecting the behavior of motorists and  pedestrians."
706,"These new duties and  responsibilities include, among other things:  changing the name of the office to OCWR;  substantially modifying the administrative dispute resolution process  under the CAA, including creating additional procedures for  preliminary hearing officer review of claims; appointing one or more advisers to provide confidential information to  legislative branch employees about their rights under the CAA; extending CAA protections to unpaid staff, including interns, detailees,  and fellows, as well as previously unprotected legislative branch  employees;  conducting a workplace climate survey;  significantly expanding OCWR reporting obligations;  creating a program to permanently retain records of investigations,  mediations, hearings, and other proceedings; and establishing an electronic system to receive and keep track of claims.
Key Cybersecurity  Management Activities  Relevant to OCWR Have  Been Established in Law  and Guidance Recognizing the importance of information security and privacy, Congress  enacted the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014  (FISMA), which requires federal agencies in the executive branch to  develop, document, and implement an information security program and  to evaluate the program for effectiveness.
However, OCWR did not use a project schedule  for the upgrade of CMS to SOCRATES that included the time frames  for key cybersecurity management activities, such as selecting and  documenting security controls, implementing controls, and assessing  controls.
Recommendations We are making five recommendations to the Office of Congressional  Workplace Rights:  The Executive Director should ensure the development and  implementation of policies and procedures for incorporating key  cybersecurity activities into IT project planning, including scheduling,  requirements management, and risk management.
(Recommendation 1) The Executive Director should ensure the development and  implementation of oversight procedures for each externally-operated  system that include establishing security and privacy requirements, planning the assessment of security controls,  conducting the assessment, and,  reviewing the assessment."
707,"We also stressed that  the Bureau needed to rigorously test census-taking activities; ensure that  scheduling adheres to best practices; improve its ability to manage,  develop, and secure its IT systems; and have better oversight and control  over its cost estimation process.
The 2020 Census  Remains High Risk  Due to Challenges  Facing the  Enumeration The 2020 Census is on our list of high-risk programs because, among  other things, (1) innovations never before used in prior enumerations are  not expected to be fully tested, (2) the Bureau continues to face  challenges in implementing IT systems, (3) the Bureau faces significant  cybersecurity risks to its systems and data, and (4) the Bureau’s cost  estimate for the 2020 Census was unreliable.
We made seven recommendations to improve the Bureau’s management  of risks to the 2020 Census, including that the Bureau develop mitigation  and contingency plans for all risks that require them, establish a clear  time frame for plan development, and ensure that the plans have the  information needed to manage the risk.
According to the Bureau’s risk management framework, the systems  expected to be used to conduct the 2020 Census will need to have  complete security documentation (such as system security plans) and an  approved authorization to operate prior to their use.
Specifically, the Bureau  is working with DHS to ensure a scalable and secure network connection  for the 2020 Census respondents (e.g., virtual Trusted Internet  Connection with the cloud), improve its cybersecurity posture (e.g., risk  management processes and procedures), and strengthen its response to  potential cyber threats (e.g., federal cyber incident coordination).
Continued  Management  Attention Needed to  Keep Preparations on  Track and Help  Ensure a Cost- Effective Enumeration  2020 Challenges Are  Symptomatic of Deeper  Long-Term Organizational  Issues The difficulties facing the Bureau’s preparation for the decennial census  in such areas as planning and testing; managing and overseeing IT  programs, systems, and contractors supporting the enumeration;  developing reliable cost estimates; prioritizing decisions; managing  schedules; and other challenges, are symptomatic of deeper  organizational issues."
708,"Specifically, in accordance with  the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended, DHS created the  National Infrastructure Protection Plan to guide the national effort to  manage risk to the nation’s critical infrastructure, including through  coordination of agencies and various critical infrastructure sectors,  including transportation systems.
The 2018 national strategy states: “While the strategy  presents a whole community plan for reducing the risks to transportation  from terrorist attacks, it is, as mandated, the governing document for  federal transportation security efforts.” Officials representing TSA  aviation, Coast Guard, TSA intermodal, and DOT stated that they did not  use the national strategy to guide their efforts; TSA surface officials stated  that it generally did guide surface transportation activities.
TSA surface and aviation, Coast Guard, and DOT officials stated that  several different strategies and planning documents with similar areas of  focus resulted in redundancy or overlap with the National Strategy for  Transportation Security."
709,"The CSBG Act requires that states submit  plans to OCS describing how they intend to use the funds to address the  needs of the local community and annual reports detailing the actual use  of funds, including information on state performance results and  populations served.
In 2012, OCS began four initiatives to update how it  oversees the performance of the CSBG program, and as of April 30 2019,  OCS had implemented all four of the initiatives, which include: an updated ROMA process for program management, 58 organizational management standards for local agencies, new federal and state accountability measures, and an updated annual report format where oversight and performance  information from states is collected in an automated online data  system.
OCS and Selected  States Conducted  Onsite and Routine  Oversight Activities  and Provided Training  and Technical  Assistance to CSBG  Grant Recipients OCS and states are responsible for conducting oversight activities to  ensure that CSBG recipients use the funds in accordance with the CSBG  Act, which includes ensuring that the funds are used in line with the  grant’s three national goals related to addressing the causes and  conditions of poverty.
Our review of oversight efforts during fiscal years  2016 and 2017 for the select states showed that OCS and states  conducted required oversight activities, as well as additional oversight  activities, and provided training and technical assistance to help CSBG  recipients meet CSBG program requirements.
In addition, for the six  selected states, we found that OCS had assessed state plans and annual  reports to ensure that the states were complying with the programmatic,  financial, and administrative requirements of the CSBG program, as  outlined in the CSBG Act. OCS’s Routine Oversight  Activities In our review of the selected states, we found that during fiscal years  2016 and 2017, OCS conducted routine reviews and other oversight  activities to assess states’ use of CSBG funds.
OCS is using the data collected in state annual reports to develop a new  national measure intended to provide a national total count of individuals  who achieve at least one positive outcome through programs and  services offered by local agencies that receive CSBG funds."

Without clearly documenting in guidance to the regional offices that  they should collect data on compliance assistance activities and  specifying which mechanism to use to maintain the data, such as ICIS,  EPA will lack key information.
In response to our first recommendation to clearly document in guidance  how regional offices should use the definition of informal enforcement to  collect data on these actions and specify a mechanism to maintain the  data, EPA said that the agency issued a September 30, 2019,  memorandum for headquarters and regional enforcement offices to  implement."
713,"The Goldwater-Nichols Act, as amended, also: established various joint officer management policies, including  requiring JPME for certain joint assignments and promotion  categories;  required officers to successfully complete an appropriate program at a  JPME school, among other things, to be designated as joint  qualified—a prerequisite for promotion to brigadier general or rear  admiral lower half rank except under certain circumstances; and  required the Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to periodically review and  revise the curriculum of JPME schools to enhance the education and  training of officers in joint matters.
In addition, for programs accredited  to award JPME, each military service is responsible for meeting the  Chairman’s PAJE accreditation requirements and providing qualified  military students and faculty to the other military services’ PME  programs in accordance with the OPMEP.
Accreditation bodies assess academic quality by applying and enforcing  standards in the following areas required, generally, by the Department of  Education: (1) success with respect to student achievement; (2) curricula;  (3) faculty; (4) facilities, equipment, and supplies; (5) fiscal and  administrative capacity; (6) student support services; (7) recruiting and  admissions practices; (8) measures of program length and objectives of  the degrees or credentials offered; (9) record of student complaints  received by, or available to, the accreditation body; and (10) record of  compliance with certain federal student loan program responsibilities.
Other than Joint Staff officials requesting that the Navy meet the  OPMEP’s JPME seminar student mix requirement, no other actions have  been taken by the Chairman, OSD, or the Navy to resolve the issue  concerning Navy participation in the Air Force’s and Army’s intermediate- level PME programs.
(Recommendation 4) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness, in coordination with the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, require the military services to periodically  report information to its office about the military services’ PME and JPME  programs—such as results of program reviews."
714,"IRS has set  one of its cross-divisional objectives as identifying “new types of tax  transactions or promotions that are either abusive or potentially abusive  requiring different levels of coordination and varying strategies.” Another of TE/GE’s audit objectives is to “promote the highest degree of  voluntary compliance with the statutes governing qualification of plans  and exemption of certain types of organizations from tax and to determine  the extent of compliance and the causes of noncompliance with the tax  laws by plans and organizations.” TE/GE accomplishes this objective by  auditing charitable organizations’ compliance with the tax code through its  Exempt Organizations unit.
To determine the  minimum number of audits these divisions conducted on abusive  schemes involving tax-exempt entities, we used IRS project codes that  IRS agreed were relevant.
When we performed a test analysis using this  tool on the narrative fields on the Form 8886, we identified keywords that  may help isolate tax-exempt organization involvement in potentially  abusive schemes and ultimately help select returns for more detailed  review.
In addition, when we compared Form 8886 filings that identified tax- exempt entities as part of the reportable transaction with SB/SE and LB&I  audit data, again for the same time period, we found 432 closed cases  with tax changes.
Our analysis shows that the tool has the  potential to help IRS better search disclosure reports for additional  information about transactions that could help IRS identify potentially  abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities.
(Recommendation 1) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should link audit data on abusive  tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities across operating divisions and  use the linked data to assess emerging issues and develop policy  responses.
To examine trends in IRS’s compliance and the characteristics of  taxpayers audited for using abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt  entities, we collected data from the following IRS business operating  divisions that conduct audits on abusive transactions: (1) TE/GE, (2)  Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE), and (3) Large Business and  International (LB&I)."

717,"Our objectives in this report are to (1) identify potentially significant areas  of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication and opportunities for cost  savings and enhanced revenues that exist across the federal  government; (2) assess to what extent have Congress and executive  branch agencies addressed actions in our 2011 to 2019 annual reports;  and (3) highlight examples of open actions directed to Congress or key  executive branch agencies.
To identify what actions, if any, exist to address fragmentation, overlap,  and duplication and take advantage of opportunities for cost savings and  enhanced revenues, we reviewed and updated our prior work and  recommendations to identify what additional actions Congress may wish  to consider and agencies may need to take.
Appendix VI provides additional information on the federal programs or  other activities related to the new areas of fragmentation, overlap,  duplication, and cost savings or revenue enhancement discussed in this  report, including budgetary information when available.
Assessing the Status  of Previously  Identified Actions To examine the extent to which Congress and executive branch agencies  have made progress in implementing the 908 actions in the approximately  325 areas we have reported on in previous annual reports on  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, we reviewed relevant legislation  and agency documents such as budgets, policies, strategic and  implementation plans, guidance, and other information between April  2019 and March 2020.

718,"Field offices review and approve organizations’  applications to become representative payees, serve as the point of  contact when organizations report changes to beneficiary or organization  information, and play a role in monitoring and overseeing representative  payees.
Some SSA Policies for  Approving Organizational  Payees Lack Detail, and  SSA Lacks a Process to  Ensure that Supplemental  Guidance Is Compliant  with Policy When an organization applies to serve as a payee, SSA’s policy  stipulates that field office staff evaluate whether the organization is  suitable.
Staff in another field office told us they created a desk guide on a range of  topics related to individual and organizational payees that includes  supplemental guidance documents and excerpts from SSA policy.
Without processes to ensure that supplemental guidance  documents are reviewed for compliance or updated in a timely manner  when policy changes, decisions to approve organizational payees may be  made inconsistently across different regions and field offices.
According to SSA policy, field offices should communicate with  organizational payees when they initially apply, and field office staff may  communicate with payees as part of periodic oversight activities—such as  through record change reporting requirements or following up on annual  accounting forms.
SSA officials said they  do not have or plan to develop a formal mechanism for collecting and  analyzing organizational payee feedback because the current process  allows field offices to respond to all public contacts in a consistent and  timely manner.
(Recommendation 4) The Commissioner of the Social Security Administration should (a)  establish a plan and time frame for periodically reviewing the predictive  model’s design; (b) consider additional data sources that would allow for  additional screening or modeling of potentially high-risk organizational  payees; and (c) ensure that subsequent design decisions are  documented in sufficient detail so the development process can be more  fully understood and replicated, either by SSA or a knowledgeable third  party, with minimal further explanation.
Specifically, with respect to our second  recommendation that SSA create safeguards in its Electronic  Representative Payee System (eRPS) to ensure that field office staff fully  document decisions to approve organizational payee applications, SSA  reported that, as part of implementing the Strengthening Protections for  Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018, planned changes to eRPS will  improve documentation of selection decisions.
To review SSA’s overall oversight of organizational payees—including  onsite reviews and reviews of the annual accounting form and payees’  use of collective accounts—we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations, program policies, and relevant SSA documents; analyzed  data; and interviewed SSA officials at the central office, the four regional  and four area offices we selected, and the eight field offices we visited."
719,"In the implementation of the DATA Act, OMB took principal responsibility  for the definitions, while Treasury took principal responsibility for the  technical standards that express these definitions, which federal agencies  use to report spending data for publication on USAspending.gov.
The action plan does not discuss how the functions carried out by the  SSGB and BSC apply specifically to the data standards established under  the DATA Act. In commenting on a draft of this report, OMB staff told us  that the “Governance Ecosystem” page on the website of Unified Shared  Services Management (USSM) describes the SSGB and links functions of  the SSGB and BSC to the DATA Act. They said it does this by showing  that OMB and Treasury have key roles in all three entities.
For  example, OMB established a governance structure to achieve the  objectives of CAP goals related to “Results-Oriented Accountability for  Grants.” As part of this broader effort to standardize grants management  business processes and data to increase efficiency and reduce reporting  burden, OMB, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other  federal agencies have published a list of draft grants management data  standards for public comment.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making two recommendations to the Office of Management and  Budget:  The Director of OMB should clarify and document OMB’s procedure for  changing official data definition standards for DATA Act reporting, for  example, by explicitly describing how change procedures developed for  other government-wide initiatives apply to DATA Act definition standards  in a public source of guidance or information."
720,"Within VA central office, the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care is  responsible for overseeing the quality of nursing home care provided to  veterans in each of the three settings—CLCs, SVHs, and CNHs. The key  mechanism VA uses to assess quality in each of these settings is regular  inspections—generally occurring annually—that determine the extent to  which homes meet relevant quality standards.
VA’s use of inspections  and other methods to ensure the quality of care in each of the three  nursing home settings differs: CLCs. VA owns, operates, and oversees the quality of CLCs, and  conducts regular unannounced inspections to determine the extent to  which CLCs meet quality standards.
As a result of these differences, in fiscal year 2017, VA paid, on average,  $1,074 per day per veteran for care in CLCs, $268 for CNHs, and $166  for SVHs. VA Contractors  Completed Required  Nursing Home  Inspections, but VA  Has Opportunities to  Enhance Its  Oversight of the  Process During the contract year completed in 2018, VA’s two contractors  conducted the required annual inspections of CLCs and SVHs to  determine the extent to which the homes met quality standards.
For each of the homes on the list, VA reports quality information it  collects through its own inspections for CLCs and information CMS  collects for CNHs. As previously noted, veterans and their families are  responsible for making decisions about the nursing home care that will  best meet their needs."
721,"Therefore, financial institutions and  their regulators generally do not have information on the types or amount  of agricultural lending to SDFRs. In contrast, USDA collects and  maintains personal characteristic data on applicants for the farm loans it  makes or guarantees in order to target loans to traditionally underserved  populations and fulfill statutorily mandated reporting requirements.
Stakeholders  Identified Multiple  Challenges That  Socially  Disadvantaged  Farmers and  Ranchers Face in  Obtaining Private  Agricultural Credit Smaller Operations,  Weaker Credit Histories,  and Land Ownership  Issues Reportedly Present  Hurdles to Obtaining  Agricultural Credit According to representatives from some SDFR advocacy groups, federal  depository institution regulators, and lending industry associations we  interviewed, SDFRs can have difficulty obtaining agricultural credit from  private-sector lenders because they operate smaller farms and in some  cases do not meet standards for farm revenue, applicant credit history,  and collateral.
Farmer Advocates Report  Additional Challenges for  Socially Disadvantaged  Farmers and Ranchers  Seeking Agricultural Credit SDFR advocates we spoke with said that in addition to difficulty meeting  loan underwriting standards, SDFRs face challenges related to historical  discrimination, ongoing unfair treatment by lenders, and a lack of  familiarity with some programs and technologies when trying to obtain  private agricultural credit.
Moreover, Farm Credit  Administration officials said Regulation B, discussed earlier, prevents the  associations from collecting data on the race, ethnicity, and sex of loan  applicants that would be needed to assess the effects of outreach efforts  on lending to socially disadvantaged groups.
Other Lenders Conduct  Little Outreach to Socially  Disadvantaged Farmers  and Ranchers and Are Not  Required to Do So According to representatives of lending industry associations we  interviewed, commercial banks generally do not target outreach for  agricultural lending to specific demographic groups.
As part of this planning, state  offices review the state’s lending goals for SDFRs, Census of Agriculture  data on the state’s farmer population, and data on Farm Service Agency  direct and guaranteed loans made to farmers belonging to different  socially disadvantaged groups to target outreach to underserved  communities."
722,"(See appendix I for additional details on the Coast Guard’s fleet of ATON  vessels.) ATON Program  Management The Coast Guard’s ATON program consists of several offices and units  that work together to carry out the ATON mission: Office of Navigation Systems: Based at Coast Guard headquarters  in Washington, D.C., the primary ATON-related roles and  responsibilities of Office of Navigation Systems officials include  providing oversight and approval for ATON operations and policy.
We recommended, among other  things, that the Coast Guard establish shore infrastructure performance  goals, measures, and baselines to track the effectiveness of maintenance  and repair investments and provide feedback on progress made; develop  and implement a process to routinely align Coast Guard’s shore  infrastructure portfolio with mission needs, including by disposing of all  unneeded assets; and employ models for its asset lines for predicting the  outcome of investments, analyzing trade-offs, and optimizing decisions  among competing investments.
The Coast Guard Has  Developed Plans and  Initiatives to Address  ATON Challenges, but  There Is Limited  Assurance that They Will  Be Effectively  Implemented The Coast Guard has taken positive steps to manage the ATON program,  including issuing strategic plans and directions, creating a unit to provide  a Coast Guard-wide perspective in managing ATON, and developing  various initiatives to improve management of fixed and floating ATON."
723,"Specifically,  since the beginning of fiscal year 2013 in response to GDUFA, FDA  increased communication with applicants prior to and during a generic  drug application’s first review cycle consistent with its goal of helping  applicants prepare approvable applications.
I for more  information on FDA’s changes to the generic drug application review  process to improve communication with applicants.) While all five  applicants we interviewed generally agreed that the increased  communications would help increase rates of first-cycle approval, they  also suggested that additional flexibility to communicate with FDA  informally mid-cycle, such as by phone, could further facilitate the review  process by helping applicants respond to questions or get clarity on  questions included in the information requests or discipline review letters.
Specifically, we identified two applications for which the complete  response letters noted recent changes in the brand-name drug’s labeling  as one of multiple factors that contributed to the generic drug application’s  failure to receive approval in the first review cycle.
Opportunities exist to enhance FDA’s efforts to increase  the rates of approval for generic drugs in the first review cycle, including  improving the consistency and clarity of reviewer comments and  assessing the effects of the timing of brand-name companies’ changes to  labeling."
724,"The SUPPORT Act also requires the  Attorney General to submit to Congress a report that provides information  about how the Attorney General is using ARCOS data to identify and stop  suspicious activity no later than one year after the date of enactment of  the SUPPORT Act. DEA Diversion-Related  Data Systems DEA operates and maintains various information systems containing  registrant information, transaction data, and suspicious drug orders that  support its efforts to prevent, detect, and investigate the diversion of  pharmaceutical controlled substances.
Suspicious order reports reported by  registrants since March 2017 operating under an active  memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the DEA that required  them to submit their reports electronically to DEA headquarters as  opposed to their local DEA field division office using the SORS  Follow-up version, according to DEA Diversion Control Division  officials.
The threat assessments use ARCOS data to  provide drug-related transaction trends and patterns related to a given  DEA field division office area of operations to help establish priorities  and allocate resources.
The SUPPORT Act requires DEA to provide distributors with access to  ARCOS data to help the distributors identify, report, and stop suspicious  orders of opioids and reduce diversion rates.
By  identifying solutions – in consultation with industry stakeholders – to  address the limitations of the ARCOS Enhanced Lookup Buyer Statistic  Tool, such as the need for additional login credentials or the ability to bulk  download data, DEA could better ensure registrants have more useful  information at their disposal when evaluating whether an order is  suspicious.
(Recommendation 3) The DEA Administrator, in consultation with industry stakeholders,  should identify solutions to address the limitations of the ARCOS  Enhanced Lookup Buyer Statistic Tool, to ensure registrants have the  most useful information possible to assist them in identifying and  reporting suspicious orders to DEA.
In addition, we interviewed DEA officials  at eight field division offices to learn about how diversion investigators  use industry-reported data and what, if any, improvements might be  needed."
725,"For example, participants from one  discussion group said that state requirements can facilitate coordination  when the state statute requires rural transit providers applying for or  receiving federal, state, or local assistance to coordinate with other state  agencies, including the state’s health and human services department, for  funding and services.
From March through June 2018, FTA and some Coordinating  Council members convened a series of focus groups with state and  local stakeholders, including transit and health and human services  providers to be informed of the current state of transportation services  and identify leading practices and barriers to transportation  coordination.
Recommendation for  Executive Action The Administrator of FTA should develop a communication plan that will  effectively share information with state transportation agencies and rural  and tribal transit providers on coordination opportunities and leading  coordination practices in an accessible and informative way."
726,"Airports Received an  Average of about $15  Billion Annually for  Infrastructure  Development from a  Variety of Sources,  Including Grants and  Revenue From fiscal years 2013 through 2017, national system airports received  an annual average of about $15 billion in funding from a variety of  sources for infrastructure development projects, including:  federal AIP grants (about $3.2 billion annually); airport revenue from passenger charges (about $3.1 billion annually),  and airport-generated revenue (about $7.7 billion annually); and  capital contributions (about $715 million annually).
According to officials from  Austin airport, the airport recently completed a 10-year plan for its capital  development program, with an estimated cost of $3.5 billion, for a new  terminal, concourse, airfield improvements, runway improvements, and  improved landside access.
For example,  according to FAA’s estimates of planned projects funded by AIP grants,  terminal projects now represent the third largest share of total estimated  costs from fiscal years 2019 through 2023 and experienced the greatest  percentage increase over the previous 5-year period.
Similarly, according to ACI-NA’s analysis, for fiscal years 2019 through  2023, terminal projects represented 53 percent of the total infrastructure- development costs among both AIP-eligible and AIP-ineligible projects.
In addition to an increased focus on terminal projects, FAA officials, ACI- NA representatives, and selected airports cited other factors that are  contributing to an increase in infrastructure costs estimates, such as  increased construction costs, an overall healthier economy, increased  traffic, airline consolidation, and airlines’ strategic shift to focus on hub  operations.
According to ACI-NA’s report on airports’ capital development needs for  2019–2023 and some selected airport officials, because airports have  already committed a significant portion of their current and future PFCs to  servicing debt on current or completed projects, airports will have less  PFC funding available for future projects.
Representatives from the International Air Transport Association and the  Steer Group Inc. said that some foreign airports may have higher airline  rates and charges compared to some airports in the United States due to  several factors, including the need to generate returns for private  financing and flexibility in setting rates and charges, as outlined below.
Airport  officials also stated the airport increases airline rates and passenger  charges only when needed to generate sufficient revenue to cover the  costs of planned infrastructure.
Similar to airline rates and charges, selected foreign airport  representatives told us that there generally are no restrictions on how the  airports use revenue from passenger charges for infrastructure or  operational costs.
Main Sources of Funding and Financing for Airport  Infrastructure Investments   According to the Finavia representative, Helsinki Airport’s main sources of  funding for infrastructure improvements are (1) airline rates and charges,  (2) passenger charges, (3) other airport-generated revenue, and (4) debt financing.
Projects that cost less than CAD $400  million (USD $301 million) are funded with passenger-fee revenues,  airline rates and charges, and other airport-generated revenues,  according to these representatives.
Factors Considered when Setting Airline and Passenger  Charges  Representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority stated that  the structure that Toronto Pearson has in place allows the airport to  increase airline rates and passenger charges only when needed to  generate sufficient revenue to cover the costs of planned infrastructure.
According to representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority,  the authority has developed a 5-year capital plan that includes several  projects intended to increase capacity and improve passenger flow at the  airport.
To determine what federal and other funding U.S. airports received from  fiscal years 2013 through 2017 for infrastructure investments, we  obtained and analyzed information on the main sources of airport funding  which included: funding from federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP)  grants and state grants, revenue from passenger facility charges (PFC),  airport-generated revenue, capital contributions, and amounts of financing  airports received from bond proceeds and other debt financing."
727,"Cost and schedule growth in DOD’s space programs is sometimes driven  by the inherent risks associated with developing complex space  technology; however, over the past 10 years we have identified a number  of other management and oversight problems that have worsened the  situation.
While SBIRS and other satellite programs provide  users with important and useful capabilities, their cost growth has  significantly limited the department’s buying power at a time when more  resources may be needed to protect space systems and recapitalize the  space portfolio.
For example, in October 2014, we found that disaggregation  could require DOD to make significant cultural and process changes in  how it acquires space systems—for instance, by relying on new  contractors, relinquishing control to providers who host government  payloads on commercial satellites, using different contracting methods,  and executing smaller but more numerous and faster-paced acquisition  programs.
Space Leadership  Changes Are a Positive  Step, But Have Some Risk We and others have reported for over two decades that fragmentation  and overlap in DOD space acquisition management and oversight have  contributed to program delays and cancellations, cost increases, and  inefficient operations.

728,"State Medicaid Policies on  Coverage for MAT  Medications, Prior  Authorization  Requirements, Preferred  Drug Lists, and  Distribution Methods May  Restrict Beneficiary  Access Our review of research and interviews with stakeholders found that  several state Medicaid program policies related to prescription drug  coverage and distribution can restrict beneficiaries’ access to MAT  medications.
Literature we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed described other  ways that prior authorization requirements can delay access to MAT  medications for Medicaid beneficiaries and other patients.
According to  literature we reviewed and officials we spoke with from a  manufacturer and an organization representing providers, some  insurance companies require that their staff or the pharmacist talk to  the patient before approving a MAT medication when using external  delivery from a specialty pharmacy.
North Carolina Medicaid officials told us that in November 2017 they  eliminated their prior authorization requirement for providers to submit  a treatment plan before treating patients with any MAT medication."
729,"Notably, stakeholders, board members, and others we interviewed said  three key factors generally limited greater board diversity: (1) not  prioritizing diversity in recruitment efforts, (2) limitations of the traditional  board candidate pipeline, and (3) low turnover of board seats.
For example, some FHLBank directors and Federal Housing  Finance Agency staff said filling interim board seats with women and  minority candidates could increase diversity.
For example,  conducting mentoring and outreach was included as a strategy in our  2019 report for increasing diversity on FHLBank boards, including current  directors pledging to identify and encourage potential women and minority  candidates to run for the board."
730,"DHS’s Approach to  Inform the Secretary’s  TPS Reviews  Includes Three  Primary Steps Our review of documentation for selected TPS decisions in fiscal years  2014 through 2018 and our interviews with DHS, USCIS, and State  officials indicated that DHS’s approach for initial or subsequent reviews of  countries for TPS consists of three primary steps:  1.
2.  DHS collects information on country conditions and recommendations  from USCIS and State and provides this information to the Secretary  of Homeland Security to inform his or her decision regarding an initial  or existing TPS designation.
State Department’s Internal Process for Compiling Information for the Secretary of Homeland Security’s Temporary  Protected Status Reviews  The Department of State’s (State) internal process for developing input for the Secretary of Homeland Security’s Temporary  Protected Status (TPS) reviews generally includes compiling information on country conditions as well as proposed  recommendations from the relevant regional bureau and overseas post, according to documentation for selected TPS  decisions in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and our interviews with DHS, USCIS, and State officials.
We found that the USCIS and State country conditions reports and  recommendation memos or letters that DHS and State provided for our  nongeneralizable sample of 26 TPS decisions included information such  as background on the cause (or reason for consideration) of the initial  TPS designation and a summary of the country’s recovery from, or the  status of, the situation to date.
USCIS and State documentation for  each of the 26 TPS decisions in our review generally included (1)  information related to the cause (or reason for consideration) of the  initial TPS designation and (2) a summary of the country’s recovery  from, or the status of, the situation to date."
731,"Covered financial institutions are expected to  complete a BSA/AML risk assessment to identify specific products,  services, and customers, which supervisory agencies can use to evaluate  the compliance programs of financial institutions and scope their  examinations.
FinCEN officials told us they have  been considering how regulators of financial institutions of different size  and risk assess BSA/AML compliance and continue to work with federal  regulators to identify better ways to supervise examinations.
For example,  FinCEN officials told us they have conducted BSA/AML compliance  examinations of financial institutions on issues such as virtual currencies  and data breaches in domestic branches of foreign banks.
FinCEN, Supervisory  Agencies and Law  Enforcement  Established  Collaborative  Mechanisms, but the  Futures Industry Has  Been Less  Represented In recent years, Treasury and FinCEN have led efforts to identify BSA  goals and priorities such as issuing a national strategy and risk  assessments for combating illicit financing crimes.
For example, in February 2014  FinCEN issued guidance that clarified how financial institutions should  align their BSA reports to meet federal and state law enforcement  priorities if the institutions provide services to marijuana-related  businesses.
FinCEN and nearly all the law  enforcement agencies with which we spoke provided some feedback to  financial institutions on how to make BSA reports more useful through  formal mechanisms (such as conferences and training sessions) and  informal relationships.
FinCEN officials said that annual law  enforcement awards ceremonies are one of the mechanisms they use  to provide financial institutions with feedback on the usefulness or  effectiveness of BSA/AML information.
Officials from  nearly all the law enforcement agencies with whom we spoke said  they have informal relationships with financial institutions to solicit and  provide feedback on their BSA reports.
FinCEN, law enforcement, and some industry associations with  which we spoke identified challenges in providing institution-specific  feedback to financial institutions on the usefulness of their BSA reporting.
(Recommendation 3) The Director of FinCEN should review options for establishing a  mechanism through which law enforcement agencies may provide regular  and institution-specific feedback on BSA reporting.
To identify key collaborative mechanisms used to implement BSA/AML  responsibilities, we reviewed agency documentation (such as strategic  plans, national strategies, and risk assessments) and prior GAO reports  that contained discussions of collaborative mechanisms, and we  interviewed agency officials from FinCEN, supervisory agencies, SROs,  and selected law enforcement agencies.
The MOUs establish that supervisory agencies  should provide FinCEN with examination data such as the number of  Bank Secrecy Act /anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) violations, informal  actions, and formal enforcement actions (on a quarterly basis)."

734,"Four agencies reported experiencing challenges involving  incomplete, unclear, missing, and evolving OMB and Treasury guidance  related to SSP implementing requirements and Broker changes, including  data elements, the technical schema, and other key policies.
Such  limitations in customer agency and SSP technology may require the use  of limited resources for error corrections and manual work-arounds,  increasing the risk of reporting errors, and may hamper customer  agencies’ and SSPs’ ability to submit quality data in accordance with the  DATA Act. Project management.
Specifically, three agencies reported that they would like to have  guidance, including standard operating procedures, for communicating  and working with their SSPs. One agency suggested additional OMB or  Treasury training on compliance with the DATA Act, and one agency  suggested improvements by Treasury to prevent Broker errors that result  from normal business scenarios and require manual work-arounds to the  agencies’ system-generated files.
To address our first objective, we interviewed four federal SSPs and  surveyed their financial management customer agencies to identify the  types and variations of services the SSPs provide related to DATA Act  implementation and meeting the act’s requirements.
We reviewed and analyzed the 27 customer agency  survey responses to identify challenges responding agencies reported  since their initial DATA Act submissions because they are working with an  SSP and any steps SSPs and their financial management customers took  to address challenges and to help ensure the quality of data submissions.
In addition, we interviewed OMB staff and Treasury officials about any  guidance they have provided or actions they have taken to assist the four  SSPs and their financial management customers with any challenges  related to DATA Act compliance."
735,"The U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS), which  was required in 2010 to coordinate the establishment of domestic  transportation policies in the Arctic to ensure safe and secure maritime  shipping, has issued several relevant reports, including a 10-year  projection of maritime activity in 2015, and a 10-year prioritization of  infrastructure needs in the U.S. Arctic in 2016—both of which were  directed by the 2014 National Strategy implementation plan.
Given that a single vessel can make multiple trips per shipping season,  U.S. Coast Guard also measures maritime activity by the number of  transits that vessels make per year through the Bering Strait, a key  convergence point for trans-Arctic routes that connects the NWP and  NSR to the Pacific Ocean.
For example, U.S. Coast Guard  reported that it has taken a flexible approach to addressing infrastructure  gaps by establishing seasonal, forward operating bases in the U.S. Arctic  as needed to provide search and rescue support in areas where major  shipping activity is occurring.
Arctic Although federal agencies have taken some steps to address gaps in  U.S. Arctic infrastructure, those efforts are not based on a government- wide assessment of the economic, environmental, and safety risks posed  by maritime infrastructure gaps to inform investment decisions in the U.S.
Given its previous reports and work in the U.S. Arctic and its coordinating  role with its member agencies, CMTS is well suited to conduct a  government-wide assessment of the risks posed by gaps in maritime  infrastructure in the U.S. Arctic.
Recommendations for  Executive Action The U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System should: Complete a government-wide assessment of the economic,  environmental, and safety risks posed by gaps in maritime  infrastructure in the U.S. Arctic to inform investment priorities and  decisions.
(Recommendation 1) The appropriate entities within the Executive Office of the President,  including the Office of Science and Technology Policy should: Develop and publish a strategy for addressing U.S. Arctic maritime  infrastructure that identifies goals and objectives, performance  measures to monitor agencies’ progress over time, and the  appropriate responses to address risks.
As stated in our report, given its previous work  in the U.S. Arctic and its coordinating role with its member agencies,  CMTS is well suited to conduct a government-wide assessment of the  risks posed by gaps in maritime infrastructure in the U.S. Arctic.
As stated in our report, CMTS is uniquely positioned as a federal  interagency coordinating committee focused on the maritime  transportation system to draw on the expertise of its member agencies,  such as U.S. Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, to complete this risk assessment."
736,"Following an appellate court decision that a portion of the disclosure  required by the SEC disclosure rule violated the First Amendment, SEC  staff issued guidance on April 29, 2014, indicating that, pending further  action by the SEC or a court, companies required to file a conflict  minerals report would not have to identify their products as “DRC conflict  undeterminable,” “not found to be ‘DRC conflict free,’” or “DRC conflict  free.” In April 2017, following the entry of the final judgment in the case, the  SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued revised guidance,  indicating that, in light of the uncertainty regarding how the commission  would resolve those issues and related issues raised by commenters, the  Division of Corporation Finance had determined that it would not  recommend enforcement action to the commission if companies did not  report on specified due diligence disclosure requirements.
Since 2011, we have reported  annually on rates of sexual violence derived from population-based  surveys, as well as on case-file data as applicable, for eastern DRC  (which consists of the provinces of Ituri, Maniema, North Kivu, and South  Kivu) and three countries that adjoin that region: Burundi, Rwanda, and  Uganda.

737,"As part of these efforts, ONDCP is to coordinate with more than a dozen  federal agencies—known as National Drug Control Program agencies— that have responsibilities for activities including education and prevention,  treatment, and law enforcement and drug interdiction (see fig.
For  example, ONDCP implemented our recommendation to assess the extent  of overlap and potential for duplication across federal programs engaged  in drug abuse prevention and treatment activities and to identify  opportunities for increased coordination as well as developed  performance metrics and reporting data regarding field-based  coordination to prevent drug trafficking.
Sufficient  capacity and efficient use of that capacity are key components for making  progress in high-risk areas; they are necessary for federal, state, and  local agencies to achieve strategic goals in addressing drug misuse, such  as implementing the National Drug Control Strategy.
Beyond specific capacity challenges that we have identified, in December  2019 we reported on challenges federal agencies face in assessing the  resources they will need to achieve the goals of the National Drug Control  Strategy.
In December 2019, we recommended that  ONDCP develop and document key planning elements to help ONDCP  structure its ongoing efforts and to better position the agency to meet  these requirements for future iterations of the National Drug Control  Strategy.
In December 2019, we recommended that  ONDCP develop and document key planning elements to help ONDCP  structure its ongoing efforts and to better position the agency to meet  these requirements for future iterations of the National Drug Control  Strategy.
We have  also found that some agencies lack plans or metrics to measure the  effectiveness of specific programs to address the drug crisis and to  demonstrate that these programs are making progress towards stated  national goals, including reducing drug overdose deaths and expanding  access to addiction treatment.
Without effective long-term  plans that clearly articulate goals and objectives and without specific  measures to track performance, federal agencies cannot fully assess  whether taxpayer dollars are invested in ways that will achieve desired  outcomes such as reducing access to illicit drugs and expanding  treatment for substance use disorders.
Examples of  statutorily required elements include a 5-year projection for the  National Drug Control Program and budget priorities; a description of  how each of the Strategy’s long-range goals will be achieved,  including a list of each National Drug Control Program agency’s  activities, and the role of each activity in achieving these goals, and  estimates of federal funding or other resources needed to achieve  these goals; performance evaluation plans for each year covered by  the Strategy for each long-range goal for each National Drug Control  Program agency; and resources required to enable National Drug  Control Program agencies to implement the plan to expand treatment  of substance use disorders and eliminate the treatment gap; ONDCP should take steps to ensure effective, sustained  implementation of the 2020 National Drug Control Strategy and future  strategies; HHS should provide guidance to states for the safe care for infants  born with prenatal drug exposure, who may be at risk for child abuse  and neglect; DEA should take steps to better analyze and use drug transaction  data to identify suspicious opioid orders and prevent diversion of  prescription opioids to be sold illegally; and  the State Department should develop and implement a data  management system for all Caribbean Basin Security Initiative  activities to reduce illicit drug trafficking or track data trends across  countries."

739,"Specifically, Arch Coal, Peabody Energy,  and Walter Energy were also self-insured operators, but DOL officials  said that their federal black lung benefit liabilities were assumed by a  reorganized company or by a purchaser, and therefore did not transfer to  the Trust Fund.
DOL’s Limited  Oversight Has  Exposed the Trust  Fund to Financial  Risk, and Its New  Self-Insurance  Process Lacks  Enforcement  Procedures In overseeing coal mine operator self-insurance in the past, DOL did not  estimate future benefit liability when setting collateral; regularly review  operators to monitor their changing financial conditions; or always use  enforcement tools available to protect the financial interests of the Trust  Fund, such as by revoking an operator’s ability to self-insure, if warranted.
As a  result, DOL officials said that the amount of collateral they will require  from operators to self-insure going forward will be based on both an  estimate of an operator’s current and future black lung liability and the risk  of default due to insolvency.
DOL’s New Self-Insurance Process Will Include Estimates of Future Benefit  Liability  Coal mine operators applying to DOL to self-insure will be required to submit: a completed application;  a certified consolidated financial statement for each of the 3 years prior to its  application;  recent black lung claims information; and  a certified actuarial report on the operator’s existing and future black lung  benefit liabilities."
740,"For example, USACE officials stated that obtaining a complete  proposal from the contractor—with sufficient information on cost and  schedule changes to begin negotiations—is a significant factor affecting  contract change time frames.

To assess the extent to which selected agencies monitor time frames for  finalizing contract changes, we collected and reviewed available GSA  data on contract modifications."
741,"In contrast, two real estate economists we interviewed said that GSA  could potentially be missing cost-saving opportunities when brokers  are not used because rental rates are generally set by competitive  market forces, also GSA’s in-house staff may not negotiate  commission credits.
In November 2019, GSA  headquarters officials said that they demonstrate cost savings of the  broker program through its Lease Cost Avoidance Plan, which  aggregates cost-savings from several efforts, including negotiating leases  below market rates, reducing rented square footage, and leasing vacant  space.
Concerns about the reliability of the Bullseye report call into question  whether the Lease Cost Relative to Market metric can accurately  demonstrate how brokers’ efforts lead to cost savings, either through  achieving rental rates below market or better rates than GSA in-house  staff.
In December 2019,  however, GSA officials told us that GSA does still track this metric, uses it  for GSA’s Lease Cost Avoidance Plan, and that the agency believes  brokers can achieve better deals for the government than in-house staff."

According to Section officials, the Section identifies  potential NVRA violations through several means, including reviewing  publically available federal elections and other data, reviewing publically  available federal and third party reports, receiving complaints, and  conducting compliance investigations that may include visits to state and  local offices.
In initiating matters under the NVRA, the Voting Section investigated  issues related to state and local jurisdiction efforts to provide registration  opportunities for voters and issues related to list maintenance.
For  example, in one case the Section alleged that a state failed to conduct  a program that makes a reasonable effort to identify and remove  ineligible voters from the state’s registration list, and that, as a result,  the state had counties with excessively high registration totals  compared to the voting age population.
Efforts to Assess Compliance  with NVRA Requirements According to Voting Section officials, the Section engaged in various  efforts to assess state and local jurisdiction compliance with NVRA  registration opportunity and list maintenance requirements, including  conducting reviews of federal election administration and other data, and  compliance investigations.
These selected  data sources are used to identify (1) registrants who move—U.S. Postal  Service National Change of Address (NCOA), Interstate Voter  Registration Crosscheck Program (Crosscheck), and returned mail; (2)  deceased registrants—the public version of the Social Security  Administration Death Master File (DMF) and state vital records; and (3)  registrants with disqualifying felony convictions—U.S. Attorneys’ records  on felony convictions.
State election officials from Nebraska, Oregon, and Virginia, and local  officials from five of the jurisdictions we visited, reported that the primary  benefit to using NCOA data is that it helps them to maintain accurate  voter registration lists by (1) providing current and accurate addresses for  their registrants, and (2) identifying registrants who have potentially  moved and no longer reside in the voting jurisdiction.
State officials from the three  states that participated in Crosscheck for multiple years (Michigan,  Nebraska, and Virginia) said they implemented additional criteria to refine  the Crosscheck data they received in order to identify valid matches of  potentially duplicate registrations and send confirmation notices,  according to the NVRA requirements.
Specifically, election officials from four local  jurisdictions said that returned undeliverable mail from voter notices sent  to registrants periodically throughout the year is usually a more recent  indicator of registrants’ changes in address compared to largescale list  maintenance activities such as an annual mailing based on NCOA data."
745,"To request higher federal matching rates for changes to Medicaid IT  systems, including eligibility and enrollment systems, states must  submit planning documents to CMS for review and approval.
For  example, Kentucky received approval to spend $192.6 million in federal  funds for its $220.9 million in expected IT costs over 2 years to implement  work requirements and other beneficiary requirements, an effective match  rate of 87 percent.
Three of our five selected states  requested and received funding approval for planned IT costs to  implement their demonstrations that did not appear to be allowable or at  higher matching rates than appropriate under CMS guidance.
Kentucky requested and received CMS approval for funds  (at the 90 percent federal matching rate) for a contract that included  activities to assist Medicaid beneficiaries obtain employment.
New Hampshire requested and received CMS approval in  2018 for federal funds at a 90 percent matching rate for $180,000 in  costs to educate beneficiaries about work requirements, including  costs to place outreach calls through an existing contracted call  center."
746,"Using data provided by the Army from this  database, we identified over 4,500 contracts awarded to small businesses  for research and development efforts in the 5 years prior to the  establishment of Army Futures Command—fiscal years 2013 through  2017.
In addition, prior to transitioning to the new command, the  Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory  and the Medical Research and Materiel Command participated in  outreach events, such as industry days and conferences focused on  small businesses, to network with and identify small businesses for  potential future awards.
Some organizations that  have transitioned to Army Futures Command, such as Combat  Capabilities Development Command, continue to track small business  engagement activities for their component.
For example, officials from Combat Capabilities Development Command  told us that they previously used several outcome-based measures,  including the number of Small Business Innovation Research products  incorporated into fielded Army acquisition programs, contracts awarded to  small businesses, and total dollars obligated to small businesses for  research and development."
747,"According to TSA  officials, pipeline operators, and association representatives, these  associations have worked closely with the federal government on a  variety of pipeline security-related issues, including collaborating on  TSA’s voluntary standards and information sharing.
However, the MOU Annex has not been updated  since its inception in 2006 to consider incorporating these changes which  includes subsequently issued presidential directives, the establishment of  the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA), and  distinctions between current TSA and PHMSA current inspection  operations.
TSA and PHMSA officials, as well as the industry association  representatives we interviewed all reported that the MOU Annex helped  to coordinate pipeline security and safety efforts because: (1) it is a  signed written agreement that can be readily consulted; (2) it  memorialized respective TSA and PHMSA roles and responsibilities for  government leaders and staff at the time; and (3) it can be modified or  amended as needed.
TSA and PHMSA  officials also reported that they communicate their agencies’  respective roles and responsibilities for pipeline safety and security to  stakeholders when conducting general outreach, information sharing  efforts, or inspections or assessments.
Similarly, TSA’s Pipeline Security and Incident Recovery Protocol Plan— which defines the roles and responsibilities of federal agencies; tribal,  state, and local governments; and the private sector for responding to a  pipeline incident—also has not been updated to reflect changes in federal  laws or policies since the plan was issued in 2010."
748,"In addition to the SAIL tools, which report data on performance measures  across the entire medical center, VHA officials told us that they may also  use other data sources as part of medical center performance  management.
For example, in  VHA’s fiscal year 2018 performance plan template, the Leading Change  appraisal element included the implementation of suicide prevention  initiatives, using medical center performance in the SAIL mental health  domain as criteria.
The findings of the previous SAIL evaluations are similar to concerns that  officials from the four networks and four medical centers in our review  expressed about SAIL’s effectiveness, including whether the star ratings  were an accurate reflection of medical center performance."
749,"As illustrated in  figure 1, the following four activities comprise the evidence-building cycle: assessing existing evidence to determine its sufficiency and if  additional evidence is needed to further understand results and inform  decision-making; prioritizing among the identified needs which new evidence to  generate, when, and how; generating new evidence, by collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing  sources of data and research results; and using that evidence to support learning and decision-making  processes.
In developing a learning agenda, an  agency should involve key leaders and  stakeholders, to help (1) meet their evidence  needs for decision-making and (2) coordinate  evidence-building activities across the  agency.
According to OMB’s  guidance, as a part of those reviews, the assessment of existing evidence  should inform agency decisions about where to focus limited available  resources to build new evidence to fulfill any identified needs.
Each of the five selected agencies conducts  strategic reviews and associated evidence assessments in similar ways,  through a variety of existing decision-making processes: CNCS and HHS use their budget formulation processes; Education incorporates strategic objective reviews into existing  quarterly reviews of progress in meeting goals; DOL uses a stand-alone strategic review process; and USAID leverages an existing review process conducted at lower  levels (i.e., its missions).
For example, CNCS officials described  an instance in which agency leadership used the agency’s budget  formulation process to prioritize evidence-building activities to address  knowledge gaps about the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community  Corps (NCCC) program.
Officials at each of the selected agencies told us that they were  considering how best to meet Evidence Act requirements to take a  systematic and coordinated approach to prioritizing evidence-building  activities, such as through learning agendas.
This report (1) describes activities  selected agencies have taken that align with congressional and Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) direction to strengthen evidence- building, and (2) examines the extent to which selected agencies’  processes for assessing and prioritizing evidence needs reflect leading  practices for collaboration."
750,"As we discuss in more detail later, the  various types of alternative fuel vehicles vary in the extent to which they  can help agencies meet existing requirements to reduce petroleum use  and the subsequently revoked requirement in place for fiscal year 2017 to  reduce tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions.
Fleet managers at two of the case study agencies said that acquiring low  greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles was key to their ability to meet the  fiscal year 2017 targets for reducing petroleum use or greenhouse gas  emissions.
Along with the acquisition of low greenhouse- gas-emitting vehicles  generally, fleet managers at some case study agencies stated that their  acquisition and use of alternative fuel vehicles also helped them to meet  the fiscal year 2017 targets for reducing petroleum and per-mile  greenhouse gas emissions.
Fleet managers at two agencies we spoke  with stated or reported that their acquisitions of hybrid vehicles and, to a  lesser extent, small numbers of plug-in hybrid and battery electric  vehicles also helped managers to meet petroleum and greenhouse gas  emissions reduction targets.
Some agencies told us that they acquired flex-fuel vehicles to meet  alternative fuel vehicle acquisition requirements, and that using E85 in  these vehicles contributed to reducing petroleum use and per-mile  greenhouse gas emissions.
First, although acquiring electric and hybrid  vehicles could help agencies meet the current fleet energy goals to  reduce petroleum use and per-mile greenhouse gas emissions in federal  fleets, depending on where and how the vehicles are used, costs can be  prohibitive.
Compared to other alternative fuel vehicles available from GSA, battery  electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and hybrid electric vehicles can offer  potential to further general federal goals to reduce petroleum use and  tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions.
DOE provided  us fleet performance data on the extent to which each of the agencies  subject to these federal requirements met requirements or directives to  acquire alternative fuel vehicles, use alternative fuel, and reduce  petroleum use and per-mile greenhouse gas emissions for fiscal year  2017."
751,"School Officials,  Researchers, and Others  Identified Both Benefits  and Concerns, and  Suggested Ways to  Improve Confucius  Institutes  Perspectives on Institute  Benefits In February 2019, we reported that officials we interviewed from case  study schools stated that Confucius Institutes’ benefits include  opportunities for schools to forge international connections and receive  funding and other resources for China-related programs."
752,"Key  monitoring responsibilities of the CORs, GORs, and AORs typically  include reviewing quarterly, annual, and other progress reports submitted  by project implementers; ensuring other required documents are  submitted; communicating with the implementers on the status of  assistance activities; and conducting site visits, among other things.
For Projects We  Reviewed, State  Generally Followed  Key Monitoring  Practices About Half  of the Time, but Did  Not Consistently  Track Performance  Measures We reviewed 15 of State/INL’s high–dollar value Mérida Initiative projects  to assess the extent to which State/INL followed key practices for  monitoring foreign assistance projects in the areas of assigning  monitoring duties to qualified staff, planning a monitoring approach, and  monitoring project implementation.
We reviewed how State/INL tracked performance  data for these selected projects as part of its efforts to assess and  approve implementing partners’ periodic performance reports and data as  outlined in the key monitoring practices.
For Projects We  Reviewed, USAID  Almost Always  Followed Key  Monitoring Practices  and Tracked  Performance Data,  but Did Not Develop  Monitoring Plans That  Address Risk We reviewed five of USAID’s Mérida Initiative projects to assess the  extent to which USAID followed key monitoring practices in the areas of  assigning monitoring duties to qualified staff, planning a monitoring  approach, and monitoring project implementation.
According to USAID officials, USAID management  conducted periodic portfolio reviews to ensure that monitoring staff  adequately monitored Mérida Initiative projects and followed key  practices."
753,"U.S. Agencies  Obligated More Than  $45 Million for  Assistance for North  Macedonia, but Total  State Department  Obligations Cannot  Be Reliably Reported U.S. government agencies obligated more than $45 million in democracy  assistance funding for North Macedonia in fiscal years 2012 through  2017, according to agency award documents and data (see table 2).
However, we are unable to report total State  obligations for democracy assistance for North Macedonia because of  uncertainty about the reliability of award data from State’s Bureau of  International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).
However, officials stated that, because of  missing codes or miscoded items, they were unable to provide reliable  data on obligations for INL awards for democracy assistance projects in  North Macedonia for fiscal years 2012 through 2017.
(See table  5 for a list of the awards in our sample.) We found that staff at the USAID  mission in North Macedonia generally evaluated applicants against the  merit review criteria stated in public notices."
754,"In addition, officials in the six selected states told us that women beyond  60 days postpartum generally would not experience gaps in treatment for  OUD when transitioning from Medicaid to SAMHSA grant-funded  programs, as women can generally continue receiving the same services  and seeing the same providers.
Similarly, Arkansas officials said that as part of a new EPSDT  policy they are drafting, the state Medicaid program will require behavioral  health screening for all children, which can include substance use  screening if determined medically necessary by the provider.
Massachusetts recently expanded its Medicaid telehealth policy to  allow for the payment of mental health and substance use disorder  services provided in many locations, including schools."
755,"BOP officials  rated the following five factors as having the most significant impact on  BOP employee safety in prisons: (1) corrections officer understaffing, (2)  disruptive inmate behavior due to illegal drugs, (3) inmate use of  unauthorized communication devices, (4) inmate gangs, and (5)  insufficient corrections training.
Recommendation for  Executive Action We are making the following recommendation to BOP:  The Director of BOP should conduct an analysis, using available incident  and cost data, and other information as appropriate, to determine if the  current decision to not issue pepper spray to minimum security prisons  should remain in effect."
756,"Acquisition policies delineate a number of sustainment-related  responsibilities for acquisition program managers, such as: developing and implementing an LCSP to inform  acquisition and sustainment phases of the program; developing strategies for managing intellectual property; using systems engineering to identify tradeoffs between  life-cycle costs and performance requirements during  design and construction;  implementing a comprehensive reliability and  maintainability engineering program; developing an obsolescence management plan; monitoring the program’s performance against its  sustainment requirements and developing strategies to  improve operational availability, O&S affordability,  maintainability, and reliability, as necessary; and working with a PSM, among other things.
Navy Spends Billions  to Fix New Ships That  Are More Difficult and  Costly to Sustain than  Shipbuilding  Programs Initially  Planned Shipbuilding program officials did not identify or mitigate sustainment  risks during the acquisition process that subsequently resulted in  significant and costly problems for the fleet.
Examples from the  SSN 774, LPD 17 Flight I, and LHD 8/LHA 6 ship classes illustrate how  shipbuilding program officials did not identify and mitigate sustainment  risk during the acquisition process, which resulted in significant and costly  maintenance paid for by the fleet once realized.
In 2015, DOD added guidance to its policy that instructed shipbuilding  programs to establish operational and materiel availability requirements  based on the extent to which ships are expected to experience major  failures, referred to as category 4 casualty reports.
Setting  operational availability requirements by mission area would provide  shipbuilding programs with information about how to identify and prioritize  key systems for additional reliability analysis or sustainment planning to  ensure that they will be sufficiently available to meet mission needs.
Since shipbuilding programs cannot use operational availability  requirements to make informed acquisition decisions, they are at risk of  continuing to deliver ships to the fleet that are not as reliable and  sustainable as needed.
Without improving how the Navy defines and uses materiel  availability requirements, shipbuilding programs are missing opportunities  to make informed acquisition decisions about how ships are maintained  and, therefore, cannot ensure that ships are available for operations when  needed.
Specifically, we  found that: 1) O&S costs in shipbuilding programs’ life-cycle cost  estimates did not account for major sustainment risks and grew  significantly; 2) LCSPs rarely included information needed to demonstrate  ships could reliably meet sustainment requirements at an affordable cost;  and 3) ILAs did not consistently identify major sustainment risks that were  subsequently realized by the fleet.
According to shipbuilding  program officials, O&S cost estimates grew after shipbuilding programs  revised their sustainment assumptions, such as by increasing the number  of crew required to operate and maintain the ships or by changing the  level of maintenance needed for various ship systems.
Additionally, without this O&S cost information, shipbuilding programs  cannot provide Navy leadership with full insight into the range of  resources that will potentially be required to sustain new ship classes  over their lifetime or support recommendations for additional resources  during acquisition to achieve sustainment assumptions.
To  do so, DOD guidance describes that shipbuilding programs should use  LCSPs to establish connections between life-cycle costs, reliability  requirements, and crew size estimates, and identify and address  sustainment issues, among other things.
DOD acquisition policy establishes that ILAs should provide an  independent assessment of the shipbuilding program’s sustainment  planning, including the identification and evaluation of issues that are  likely to drive future O&S costs, design changes that could reduce O&S  costs, and the adequacy of the product support strategy, among other  things.
However, we  found that some of these efforts will likely not address the underlying  need for Navy leadership to improve its consideration of shipbuilding  programs’ sustainment goals early in the acquisition process as programs  are making the decisions that have a long-term effect on ship  sustainment.
These Gate reviews offer Navy leadership opportunities to conduct  oversight of shipbuilding programs’ sustainment planning during early  phases of the acquisition process when key program decisions about  requirements, design, and contracts are being made.
Systemic changes are needed to  improve shipbuilding programs’ sustainment outcomes, including:  setting clear sustainment requirements that are useful for acquisition  decision-making and reporting the results to Congress,  improving O&S cost estimates, sustainment planning, and logistics  assessments, and  involving the PSM early in the acquisition process.
(Recommendation 6) The Secretary of the Navy should direct the ASN (RD&A) to ensure all  shipbuilding programs develop and update LCSPs, in accordance with  DOD policy, that demonstrate how a ship class can be affordably  operated and maintained while meeting sustainment requirements,  including associated business case analyses and identifying sustainment  risk.
(Recommendation 10) The Secretary of the Navy should revise SECNAVINST 5000.2 and other  associated guidance to ensure PSMs are assigned to shipbuilding  program offices in time to inform early acquisition decisions, including  development of the program’s sustainment requirements and LCSPs."
757,"FEMA’s, States’, and  Territories’ Roles and  Responsibilities for  Disaster Recovery Once the President has declared a major disaster, FEMA, the state or  territorial government (the recipient), and local or territorial entities (the  subrecipient) work together to, among other things, identify and develop  projects through the Public Assistance program and Hazard Mitigation  Grant Program.
Under the Public Assistance program’s permanent work categories,  FEMA also provides grant funding for cost-effective hazard mitigation  measures to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to people and property  from future natural and man-made disasters and their effects.
For example, USVI  officials told us that the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management  Agency—the agency initially responsible for overseeing all aspects of  both the Public Assistance program and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program  in the territory—did not have enough employees on staff to effectively  implement and manage these programs.
Given the uncertainty around these  fixed-cost estimates, USVI officials told us the territory will need to  balance the potential flexibilities provided by the alternative procedures  program with the financial risk posed by cost overruns when deciding  whether to use the alternative procedures or the standard Public  Assistance program for any given permanent work project.
In September 2018, FEMA issued guidance for  implementing section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act through the  Public Assistance alternative procedures program, which provides that  critical services infrastructure—such as medical and educational  facilities—is eligible for replacement “if repair is feasible, but replacement  is more prudent.” FEMA officials in the USVI told us that since the agency  did not have further guidance or criteria on the appropriate process for  evaluating repair or replacement under this new standard, they were  responsible for developing the agency’s first justification to support the  replacement of a hospital in St. Croix based on their interpretation of the  new standard.
As the recipient of federal disaster funding, the USVI is responsible  for providing oversight over the Public Assistance program and Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program to ensure they are implemented in compliance  with applicable laws and regulations, as well as FEMA policies and  guidance.
(Recommendation 1) The FEMA Administrator should assess the need for an agency-wide  consolidated standard operating procedures document for the Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program that provides detailed information on the roles  and responsibilities, requirements, and key tasks and milestones for  monitoring and closing out program projects."
758,"In  addition, the federal government does not have a strategic federal  approach for investing in the highest priority climate resilience projects  that includes periodically identifying and prioritizing projects as supported  by enterprise risk management practices and our Disaster Resilience  Framework.
Potential projects may differ in purpose and location and  could include constructing hard infrastructure (e.g., flood defenses such  as seawalls) and natural infrastructure (e.g., wetlands in coastal areas) to  protect against climate hazards, relocating a community out of harm’s  way, or developing a suite of projects designed to collectively address a  climate hazard (e.g., wildfire risk or drought) in a particular region of the  country, according to several stakeholders we interviewed and based on  our review of several reports.
Options for Focusing  Federal Funding on High- Priority Climate Resilience  Projects Have Strengths  and Limitations Options for focusing federal funding on high-priority climate resilience  projects—coordinating funding provided through multiple existing federal  programs with varied purposes and creating a new federal funding source  specifically for high-priority climate resilience projects—have strengths  and limitations, based on our review of our prior work, relevant reports,  and the Louisiana and Canadian examples, as well as interviews with  stakeholders.
Specifically, funding for high-priority  resilience projects identified in the master plan is provided via several  federal and nonfederal programs designed for wetlands restoration,  hurricane risk reduction, oil spill recovery, and community development,  among other purposes, when the program’s purpose aligns with the  project’s purpose.
Based on our review of the Louisiana example, interviews with  stakeholders, and a report we reviewed, we identified several strengths of  coordinating multiple existing federal programs with varied purposes to  fund high-priority climate resilience projects: Leveraging existing programs.
Providing funding for high-priority climate resilience  projects via existing federal programs could encourage agencies to  think more intentionally about climate change on a regular basis when  implementing their programs, according to several stakeholders we  interviewed.
On the basis of our review of the Louisiana example, relevant reports,  and interviews with stakeholders, as well as our past work—including the  Disaster Resilience Framework—we identified several limitations of using  existing programs to fund high-priority climate resilience projects: Administratively challenging to coordinate.
We found that to  strategically identify and prioritize climate resilience projects for federal  investment, the federal government could take six key steps, based on  reports we reviewed, past GAO work, international standards, and  stakeholders we interviewed.
To identify key steps that provide an opportunity for the federal  government to strategically prioritize climate resilience projects for federal  investment, we reviewed our prior work related to risk management,  climate change, climate resilience, and hazard mitigation, including our  Disaster Resilience Framework and enterprise risk management report."
759,"Currently, DOD is contracting for this  support with the prime contractor largely through annual contracts, and it  plans to transition to multiple-year, fixed-price, performance-based  sustainment contracts when the program achieves certain condition- based criteria, including the establishment of critical sustainment  capabilities and the government’s ability to collect and more fully assess  performance and cost data.
The prime contractor manages  the F-35 supply chain and is responsible for allocating parts to F-35 sites  and participants based on contracted requirements, such as numbers of  aircraft and planned flying hours, and program business rules.
DOD Will Likely Continue  to Face Challenges in  Achieving F-35  Performance  Requirements with its  Current Approach to  Planning for and Allocating  Spare Parts In September 2018, the Secretary of Defense directed the services to  achieve and maintain 80 percent mission capability for the F-35 fleet by  the end of fiscal year 2019, which program and Office of the Secretary  of Defense officials have told us will be difficult to accomplish, given the  supply and maintenance challenges facing the fleet.
According to program and prime contractor documentation, DOD would  need to model and fund the spare parts pool to achieve an S-rate of no  higher than 10 percent in order to achieve requirements for aircraft  performance, such as the mission capability target set by the Secretary of  Defense and the services’ goals for air vehicle availability.
They further said that their  recent modeling and analysis efforts for the fiscal year 2020 program  budget review did not formally consider additional investments to lower  the planned S-rate to 10 percent as a course of action, but that this  misalignment between the quantity of parts that DOD is planning to  purchase and what is needed will hinder DOD’s ability to meet warfighter  performance requirements.
Without a comprehensive  review to determine what additional actions are needed to close the gap  between warfighter requirements for aircraft performance and what the F- 35 supply chain is capable of delivering, taking into account also the need  to reduce the sustainment costs of the F-35, DOD risks that its F-35 fleet  may fall short of the capability needed to support its critical national  defense missions in the future.
Without a process for  DOD to modify the F-35 afloat and deployment spares packages, to  include reviewing the parts within the packages to ensure that they match  deploying aircraft and accounting for updated parts demand, and without  aligning any necessary funding for needed updates, the military services  face risk that the parts that they have specifically purchased to meet their  operational requirements will not be sufficient to do so.
Without completing a detailed  plan for the establishment of the F-35 program’s global network for  moving parts that outlines clear requirements and milestones to get the  network to full operational capability, and includes mechanisms to identify  and mitigate risks of delays or gaps in the global network, the program  cannot ensure that its supply chain will support U.S. and international  program participants as intended.
In a September 2018  memorandum responding to the Secretary of Defense’s direction to  address F-35 parts shortages, the Air Force Chief of Staff, the Chief of  Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps raised  concerns about the program’s inadequate supply chain and repair  networks and reported on the funding that the services, as customers,  provided to the Joint Program office to improve delivery of spare parts  and accelerate depot maintenance capability.
In order to assess the extent to which the supply chain is  positioned to meet future warfighter requirements, we examined program  plans, briefs, and other related documentation, and we interviewed Office  of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. service, program office, and prime  contractor officials to identify the actions that DOD is taking to increase  the availability of F-35 spare parts, DOD’s projections for when these  actions will result in improvements in F-35 aircraft performance, and  ongoing areas of challenge that could create risk for the program in  meeting future warfighter requirements.
To assess the extent to which DOD can effectively manage and move F- 35 parts to support aircraft around the world, we reviewed military service  and program briefings and data related to DOD’s fiscal year 2018 F-35  operational deployments, and we interviewed service, program office, and contractor officials about how the F-35 supply chain and its global spares  pool were able to support these deployments, including the extent to  which the packages of parts that the military services purchased to  support these deployments were built to meet their requirements."
760,"AOC continued its planning and design work through 2014 to establish  the final scope of the Cannon project, which entailed correcting most of  the identified deficiencies and addressing current requirements such as  for energy conservation, physical security, hazardous materials  abatement, and historic preservation."
761,"Regulators’  Approaches to  Oversight of  Management at Large  Depository  Institutions Generally  Were Consistent with  Leading Risk- Management  Practices Since 2009, federal banking regulators have revised policies and  procedures to address management weaknesses at large depository  institutions, including by differentiating levels of severity for supervisory  concerns and specifying when to communicate them to management at  the institutions.
Specifically, MRAs describe practices that (1) deviate  from sound governance, internal control, or risk-management principles,  and have the potential to adversely affect the bank’s condition, including  its financial performance or risk profile, if not addressed; or (2) result in  substantive noncompliance with laws or regulations, enforcement actions,  or conditions imposed in writing in connection with the approval of any  application or other request by the bank.
For example, the policies  and procedures almost always provided examiners with clear and  actionable objectives for risk-management governance; enabled  examiners to identify whether an institution had established a clear  governance framework; assisted examiners in identifying, reporting, and  recommending changes to address existing and emerging risks; and  required review of institutions’ compliance with applicable laws and  regulations.
For instance, to assess the adequacy of  an institution’s overall corporate governance, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and  OCC examiners of the selected institutions generally conducted reviews  of areas such as board and management oversight and internal audit.
Reserve Bank examiners stated the  condition and required corrective action in their internal and external  communications of supervisory recommendations to depository  institutions, consistent with Federal Reserve policies and procedures.
FDIC and the Federal Reserve are missing an opportunity to  communicate complete information, in writing, to the boards of institutions  regarding the cause of the identified deficiency that led to the supervisory  concern, which would facilitate a better understanding of why the  institution’s condition deviates from safety and soundness standards.
The Director of the Division of Risk Management Supervision of FDIC  should update policies and procedures on communications of supervisory  recommendations to institutions to provide more complete information  about the recommendation, such as the likely cause of the problem or  deficient condition, when practicable.
(Recommendation 1) The Director of the Division of Supervision and Regulation of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System should update policies and  procedures on communications of supervisory concerns to institutions to  provide more complete information about the concerns, such as the likely  cause (when practicable) and potential effect of the problem or deficient  condition.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report examines (1) the extent to which federal banking regulators’— the Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC), Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC)—revised policies and procedures for supervision of  management at large depository institutions were consistent with leading  risk-management practices; (2) how examiners applied agency policies  and procedures for supervision of management at large depository  institutions they oversee; and (3) trends in regulators’ supervisory  concern data for all depository institutions since 2012 and how regulators  tracked and used such data.
We interviewed staff at FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC about  examination policies and procedures for large depository institutions,  processes related to supervision of management at such large  institutions, and use of supervisory concerns to address weaknesses they  identified.
Examining How  Regulators Tracked and  Used Supervisory  Concern Data To evaluate the extent to which the federal banking regulators ensured  that large depository institutions addressed risk management-related  supervisory concerns, such as MRA, and addressed supervisory  concerns since 2012, we (1) analyzed the regulators’ policies and  procedures for escalating supervisory concerns to enforcement actions,  and (2) analyzed aggregate supervisory concern data from 2012 to 2016  for all institutions supervised by FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC."
762,"These reviews support Centers objectives 1, 2, and 3— developing and refining Centers’ policies and processes, consistently applying Army standard designs, and supporting AFSP objectives and priorities—by identifying areas of the design needing improvement, evaluating whether a facility was constructed in accordance with the approved project design, and eliciting customer feedback concerning whether the finished facility meets mission requirements.
Specifically, the Army does not  have performance measures in place to assess the progress the Centers  have made toward assuring consistent application of standards from the  Centers’ program (second objective of the Centers) or monitoring the  Centers’ execution to meet the overarching objectives and priorities of the  AFSP and standardization process (third objective of the Centers)  including, among other things, reducing design costs and time,  construction costs and time, and change orders during construction."

764,"According to the typical  process outlined in the GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) PBS Desk  Leasing Guide, officials work with the tenant agency to define the  requirements for the leased space, including the geographic area in which  GSA will search for available properties.
These areas were: Structure: overall characteristics of a lease including the volume and  complexity of requirements, and how GSA structures rent payments,  reimbursements for tenant improvements, and provision of services; Requirements: specific provisions in the lease such as early  termination, janitorial and maintenance, tenant substitution, and real  estate taxes; and Process: the steps lessors must follow to complete a GSA lease,  such as the length of time and GSA’s ability to remain in a space after  the end of the lease.
Lessors Said GSA Leases  Are Attractive because of  Lower Financial Risk and  Stability The stakeholders we spoke with identified a number of benefits of GSA  leasing that are attractive to potential lessors, including the government’s  credit worthiness, long average tenancy in a space, and positive  relationships with GSA and tenant agencies.
GSA officials said that each of  these aspects reflects GSA’s contracting policy, and it is not required to  structure its leases this way by law, regulation, or executive order;  however, they use these requirements to provide additional flexibility in  managing their lease portfolio and reduce risk to the government.
Because of this,  when preparing a bid we have to estimate operating expenses years  into the future, which can be difficult, and if we guess too low we can  end up losing money on the lease.” Tenant Improvements About one-third of the stakeholders we spoke with said the way GSA  structures reimbursement for tenant improvements is a challenge, and  three lessors said GSA’s requirements for construction standards and  space designs can be difficult to meet.
In addition, half of the lessors we spoke with  identified challenges with the process of developing and finalizing agency  requirements for leased space, including frequent changes to space  requirements and the need to develop detailed construction information  before bidding on a lease."
765,"A replan is a process generally driven by changes in  program or project cost parameters, such as if development cost growth  is 15 percent or more of the estimate in the baseline report or a major  milestone is delayed by 6 months or more from the baseline date.
NASA officials also stated that the 6 to 12 months of risk to the  launch date accounts for the possibilities that SLS and Orion testing and  final cross-program integration and testing at Kennedy Space Center may  result in further delays.
SLS: First Mission Will  Incur Additional Delay as  Challenges with Core  Stage Production  Continue, and Cost  Growth Underreported SLS Will Not Meet June 2020  Replan Schedule The SLS program will not meet the June 2020 launch date for the first  mission due, in part, to ongoing development issues with the core stage.
However, during our review, Orion program officials stated that this cost  estimate assumes an EM-2 launch date of September 2022, which is 7  months earlier than the program’s agency baseline commitment date of  April 2023 that forms the basis for commitments between NASA, the  Congress, and OMB.
According to federal law,  the Administrator must be immediately notified any time that a designated  official has reasonable cause to believe that either the program’s  development cost is likely to exceed the estimate in the agency baseline  commitment by 15 percent or more or a program milestone will slip 6  months or more beyond its schedule agency baseline commitment date.
Contractors Received  Majority of Award  Fees but NASA  Experienced Poor  Program Outcomes NASA’s award fee plans for the SLS stages and Orion crew spacecraft  contracts provide for hundreds of millions of dollars to incentivize  contractor performance, but the programs continue to fall behind  schedule and incur cost overruns.
As  previously discussed, within 1 year of announcing a delay for the first  mission, senior NASA officials acknowledged that the SLS and Orion  programs will not meet the new EM-1 schedule of December 2019, and  the 6 months of schedule reserve available to extend the date to at least  June 2020 has been consumed.
In addition, NASA determined in 2017 that Lockheed Martin would not  meet the delivery date for the crew module—even if the European  Service Module were on schedule—when numerous problems including  design issues, damage during testing, and manufacturing process  changes resulted in major schedule impacts to the program."
766,"Two groups of beneficiaries identified as potentially at risk are excluded  from Medicare DMPs during the case management process: First, CMS  will automatically exempt from Medicare DMP consideration any  beneficiary who (a) has elected to receive hospice, palliative, or end-of- life care; (b) is a resident of a long-term-care facility or of another facility  for which frequently abused drugs are dispensed for residents through a  contract with a single pharmacy; or (c) has active cancer-related pain.
The notification letter notifies each beneficiary that he or she has been  identified as potentially at risk; details which coverage limitations the  sponsor intends to implement and for how long; explains how the  beneficiary can submit preferences for the selected frequently abused  drugs prescriber(s) and the selected dispensing pharmacy or pharmacies  for frequently abused drugs in case a lock-in tool is used; provides  information about resources and plan benefits that address prescription  abuse; explains how additional information can be provided to the plan  sponsor; and informs the beneficiary of the right to appeal, among other  things."
767,"The Air Force Has  Not Established a  Business Case for  ABMS, Increasing  Development Risks The Air Force has not established a plan or business case for ABMS that  identifies its requirements, a plan to attain mature technologies when  needed, a cost estimate, and an affordability analysis.
In addition to an acquisition strategy,  other basic elements of a sound acquisition business case include firm  requirements, a plan for attaining mature technologies, and a reliable cost  estimate and affordability analysis, further described below.
Conclusions The Air Force started ABMS development activities without a business  case that defines ABMS requirements, a plan to ensure technologies are  mature when needed, a cost estimate, and an affordability analysis."
768,"In our 2018 report, we noted that officials from the PSLF servicer said that  borrowers were frequently confused by the PSLF program requirements  related to qualifying loans, employment, repayment plans, and  payments.
Similarly, in our 2019 report on the temporary expanded  process, we noted that officials from Education, the PSLF loan servicer,  and representatives from selected organizations representing student  borrowers all said that the requirement to submit an application for the  PSLF program to be eligible for the temporary expanded process can  confuse borrowers."
769,"Agencies will need to apply appropriate  talent management strategies that are adapted to these trends to recruit,  develop, and retain a high-performing workforce and better meet their  missions (see fig."
770,"DOD then established a new acquisition  program baseline that increased the program’s cost estimates by $162.7  billion and extended delivery schedules 5-6 years into the future.
In June 2018, we recommended that the program resolve all critical  deficiencies before making a full-rate production decision, in part, to  reduce the potential for additional concurrency costs stemming from  continuing to produce aircraft while testing was ongoing.
The 9-month delay  needed to complete testing, however, also provides additional time for the  program to address our June 2018 recommendation that it resolve critical  deficiencies before making its full-rate production decision, currently  planned to occur between September 2020 and March 2021.
According to contractor officials, the  improved rates of on-time delivery are partially a result of the contractor’s  efforts to obtain a performance incentive fee that was added to the lot 11  production contract.
However, according to  DOD officials, the F-35 program office and prime contractor convene a  monthly Joint Risk Management Board, which identifies and manages  overall program risk, and has completed an independent technical risk  assessment to support the full-rate production decision, which identified  production risks.
Block 4 Reporting  Requirement Expires  Before Completion  Date, and Cost  Estimate Does Not  Fully Reflect Leading  Practices In its May 2019 report to Congress, DOD outlined its plans for Block 4  with a development cost estimate of $10.6 billion for activities through  fiscal year 2024.
(Recommendation 4) The OUSD (A&S) should direct the F-35 program office to consider the  results of its future technology readiness assessment of all Block 4  technologies and incorporate the cost and schedule risks of developing  those technologies in the next update to its Block 4 cost estimate to  ensure that the estimate meets the comprehensive leading practices.
DOD also did not concur with our third recommendation for the F-35  program office to complete a program-level, product-oriented work  breakdown structure (WBS) for the next update to its Block 4 cost  estimate.
In this report, we (1) provide information  on the program’s progress toward completing operational testing and  resolving deficiencies found in testing; (2) assess the program’s  production performance and manufacturing efficiency initiatives; and (3)  assess the program’s modernization cost estimate and progress with  Block 4 development efforts.
To assess  progress with Block 4 development efforts, we interviewed DOD and  program office officials, and contractor representatives regarding the  program’s Block 4 planning, development, testing, and production  activities to date."
771,"According to our analysis of Secret  Service data, special agents assigned to the Office of Investigations  expended 11.2 million hours supporting protective operations during fiscal  years 2014 through 2018.
For example, according to Secret Service officials, in fiscal year  2016, the Office of Investigations shifted special agents from criminal  investigations to help meet the additional protection demands of the 2016  Presidential Campaign.
In  our interviews with 40 current and former special agents, 38 reported that  Secret Service personnel develop relationships with state and local law  enforcement while conducting investigations, and that these relationships  can benefit protective operations.
However, Secret Service officials told us the agency has not identified  which of its current types of criminal investigations and related activities  best prepare special agents for protective responsibilities, nor has it  established a framework to help ensure that Phase 1 special agents gain  experience in those areas to the extent possible.
Secret Service and  Selected Federal  Agencies Investigate  Similar Financial  Crimes, Which  Federal Prosecutors  We Interviewed  Reported to Be  Beneficial Types of financial crimes most often prosecuted by U.S. Attorneys based  on Secret Service referrals during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 were  similarly investigated by four additional federal law enforcement agencies,  including the FBI, Homeland Security Investigation, IRS Criminal  Investigation, and the U.S. Postal Inspections Service.
Until the agency  identifies investigations that address each priority criminal threat and the  related resources, Office of Investigations management and senior-level  Secret Service officials will not know the extent to which its operations are  aligned with the stated priorities.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report addresses the following objectives: (1) how, if at all, do the  U.S. Secret Service’s (Secret Service) investigative operations support or  negatively affect its protective operations; (2) to what extent do the Secret  Service and selected federal entities investigate similar financial crimes,  and to what extent do selected federal prosecutors find this to be  beneficial; (3) to what extent has the Secret Service developed a plan to  combat its priority criminal threats; and (4) to what extent does the Office  of Investigations’ staffing model ensures compensation limits are  accounted for when estimating staffing needs."
772,"Subsequently, the agency places  information on the property in GSAXcess and then other federal agencies  can screen, request, and, if approved by GSA, obtain the excess property  for their own use or can then provide it to an authorized non-federal  recipient free of charge, minus transportation costs.
Through the various programs at our selected agencies, officials reported  to us that they provided property with an original acquisition value of  between $0.4 and $33 million to non-federal recipients through their  agency-specific programs in fiscal year 2017, most of it through the  Forest Service’s Federal Excess Personal Property Program.
However, we found that the selected  agencies did not take steps, such as communicating information, to  ensure that the non-federal recipient programs were carried out in  accordance with the agency’s property management regulations or  program requirements, for various reasons: At USDA, Office of Property and Fleet Management officials  acknowledged they have not consistently provided oversight of  personal property across USDA because it was not considered a  priority within the agency to do so.
Even if those inputting data did refer to the sheet, GSA officials told us  that since these are agency-specific programs, they are not aware of all  the ways in which agencies are able to provide property to non-federal  recipients and that the reporting tool may not reflect all the current  authorities and programs used.
According to GSA’s bulletin, agencies are required to report  all of their transactions involving excess property provided to non-federal  recipients, but do not need to report items sold, transferred, or donated by  GSA on their behalf as part of the disposal process."
773,"CBP officials told us that higher overall  applicant pass rates paired with recent increases in the number of  applications received by the agency are starting to result in an increase in  the number of law enforcement officers hired, as applicants complete  CBP’s hiring process and officially enter on duty.
In addition to having the lowest pass rate of  any step in CBP’s process, the polygraph examination also took CBP  officer and Border Patrol agent applicants, on average, the longest  amount of time to complete in fiscal year 2017—74 days and 94 days,  respectively."
774,"For example, VHA’s fiscal year 2018 through 2019 strategy,  operationalizing VA’s goal for veteran choice, is to “honor veterans’  preferences by offering home and community based care to prevent  unwanted nursing home care.” VHA strategic planning occurs every  two years according to VA officials.
II for more information on  veterans’ utilization of institutional and noninstitutional long-term care  by program.) According to VA, veterans’ use of VA long-term care programs increased  during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for several reasons, including that  a large number of Vietnam veterans are aging and that more veterans are  receiving higher service-connected disability ratings.
III for more information on  projected utilization for institutional and noninstitutional long-term care  by program.) VA reports that these projections are based on expected increases in the  number of veterans who will rely on VA for their long-term care needs  through fiscal year 2037."
775,"As a result of the 2016 Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach, the program  repeated the milestone associated with system development start and  established new cost and schedule objectives and thresholds, conducted  a baseline review of the schedule to verify the work necessary to  complete the program, and received approval of the acquisition program  baseline by the milestone decision authority—the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.
In December 2017, we found risks to the latest proposed (but not yet then  approved) OCX schedule, noting that the schedule to which the program  was working at that time (1) was built on certain unproven assumptions  regarding planned coding and testing improvements, (2) had not yet  undergone a baseline review to verify that the schedule incorporated all of  the work required for program completion, and (3) did not yet include a  number of changes that the Air Force needed to incorporate into the  contract with Raytheon as modifications, which may lead to additional  schedule slips.
While the Air Force  and the contractor periodically update their schedule estimates, no plans  currently exist for further independent analysis of the full program  schedule within DOD, and there is no requirement to do so.
Once the Air Force determines that the developmental testing is  completed, OCX will be ready to transition to operations, which ends the  full program schedule.
According to OCX program officials, Raytheon will provide interim  contractor support to address any defects or incomplete work as well as  address any additional issues found during the planned 7 month post- acceptance developmental testing."
776,"For example, according to OMB staff, the grants portion of the  Section 5 Pilot focused on identifying how changes in grants data  collection and grant management may reduce federal recipient reporting  burden.
The Section 5 Pilot fully met the following statutory requirements:  (1) that pilot data collection cover a 12-month reporting cycle; (2) timely  issuance of OMB’s report to Congress in August of 2017 to select  congressional committees; and (3) that the report to Congress contain a  discussion of any needed legislative actions as well as recommendations  related to automating and streamlining aspects of federal financial  reporting to reduce the reporting burden of federal award recipients.
The Grants Portion of  the Pilot Identified  Several Ways to  Reduce Reporting  Burden and Provided  Support for  Government-Wide  Streamlining Efforts  All Six Grant Test Models  Reported Evidence of  Reducing Burden,  Increasing Accuracy, or  Both As the agency designated by OMB to execute the grants portion of the  Section 5 Pilot, HHS developed and analyzed six “test models” to  determine if adopting the proposed changes would contribute to the pilot  program’s objectives of reducing reporting burden and duplication.
As support for the first recommendation,  the report stated that results from the procurement pilot test models  demonstrated that standard data elements—coupled with uniform data  adoption—and the ability to centrally collect and share information  reduces administrative burden."
777,"In DOE’s written comments on  a draft of our report, reproduced in our final report, the department  explained that it will designate a scientific integrity official to be  responsible for leading and coordinating with other offices across DOE to  develop measures to educate and communicate to staff about scientific  integrity policies."
778,"Key Practices for Agency  Reform Efforts In developing our June 2018 report to assist Congress, OMB, and  agencies in assessing agency reform plans, we reviewed our prior work  on key practices for organizational transformations; collaboration;  government streamlining and efficiency; fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication; and high risk and other long-standing agency management  challenges.
In another example, some of USAID’s human resource reform  projects address another listening tour theme related to the need to  support USAID employees in focusing more of their attention on  achieving strategic priorities and less time on inefficient and burdensome  administrative tasks.
USAID is using both the Human Resource Transformation project and  two of T3’s projects to develop a strategic workforce plan and associated  tools: USAID developed and began implementing the Human Resources  Transformation project prior to the start of the current reform effort  with the expectation that by 2020 the agency would have the  organizational structure and workforce characteristics that support  achievement of USAID’s mission.
To determine the extent to which USAID has addressed key practices for  planning and implementing its reform efforts, we assessed USAID’s  reform efforts against key practices identified in our June 2018 report,  which are organized by 12 subcategories of change management  practices."
779,"Puerto Rico is Developing  an Internal Controls Plan  and Recovery  Management Policies and  Procedures to Provide  Oversight of Federal  Recovery Funds As previously discussed, Puerto Rico designated COR3 to administer and  manage the Public Assistance program in coordination with FEMA.
In addition, according to COR3  officials, COR3 plans to provide direct technical assistance related to  federal grants management to Puerto Rico’s cabinet-level agencies,  public corporations, municipalities and other eligible subrecipients.
Similarly,  according to COR3 officials, COR3 is currently developing additional  guidance and standard operating procedures to help subrecipients,  including municipalities and Puerto Rico government agencies, better  understand FEMA Public Assistance grant requirements."
780,"The guidance requires that the  services use SSA products as common starting points for studies  evaluating their force structure needs for implementing the defense  strategy and supporting their budget development, among other things.
DOD stated in its 2016 Defense Analytic Guidance that SSA is not  adequately exploring innovative approaches to meet future challenges,  and called for OUSD (Policy) to identify key operational assumptions for  the services to use to conduct sensitivity analyses.
Until DOD provides specific guidance requiring the  services to explore a range of innovative force structure approaches  relevant to the threats identified in the 2018 National Defense Strategy,  including identifying key assumptions for sensitivity analyses, DOD senior  leaders may not have full visibility into the risks in the joint force’s ability  to execute the missions set out in the National Defense Strategy.
Without determining the analytic  products needed and updating them, issuing specific guidance requiring  alternatives and key assumptions to be fully analyzed, and developing an  approach for conducting joint analysis, DOD may not be providing its  leaders with the analytic support they need to prioritize force structure  investments that would best manage risk and address the threats outlined  in the National Defense Strategy."
781,"However, according to agency officials, data on the effects of airline IT  outages (including delay and cancellation data related to airline IT  outages) are discarded because information about airline-caused  flight disruptions do not provide instructive information to FAA about  whether the agency is efficiently operating the NAS.
Finally, to monitor airline on-time performance and baggage handling and  to provide information to consumers, DOT requires certain airlines to  report data to BTS monthly, including the causes of flight delays and  cancellations.
For example, we found more information about IT outages that  had nationwide or multi-day consumer or operational effects because  these incidents garnered more coverage—and often an official airline  response—as compared to those that were of shorter duration or affected  a regional carrier or smaller number of flights, passengers, or airports.
Although not included in Delta’s contract of carriage, the  airline provided $200 in travel vouchers to all customers with flight  disruptions lasting at least 3 hours for two of the IT outages we  identified, according to airline representatives.
Consumer Concerns  Stemming from Airline IT  Outages As mentioned above, collecting and analyzing passenger complaints is  one way DOT helps ensure that an airline fulfills its obligations included in  its contract of carriage and customer service plan, as well as any  additional accommodations that may be publicly offered."
782,"OMB and Treasury determine budgetary designation as a trust fund when  a law both dedicates collections to a program and identifies the account  as a “trust fund.” Trust funds, however, are not the only way dedicated  collections are accounted for in the federal budget.
In contrast, the Department of the Interior  had the greatest number of trust funds and other dedicated funds, but  these 118 funds together held $14.9 billion, which is less than 1 percent  of the total balances held in these types of accounts at the end of fiscal  year 2018.
Both the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF)  program and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund receive  contributions from both current employees and their employing  agencies as their primary sources of income, but these accounts also  receive some general revenue in addition to these dedicated  collections.
For  example, although the Crime Victims Fund has mandatory budget  authority to obligate funds from its available balances, limits in annual  appropriations acts have often capped the amount that may be obligated  in each fiscal year.
To examine trends in the size and scope of federal trust funds and other  dedicated funds, we used Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  budget data to identify the income, outgo (i.e., outlays and transfers to  another government account), and end of year balances for all revolving  trust funds, special funds, non-revolving trust funds, and public enterprise  funds reported in OMB’s budget database, OMB MAX, for fiscal years  2014 to 2018 in nominal terms."

DHS agreed and estimated that this effort would be completed by  July 31, 2019."
784,"In support of the WCF’s goal to support efficient and effective delivery of  goods and services, the WCF Division provides quarterly usage reports to  customers and business line offices and assists them with monitoring  their consumption and associated costs of shared services.
WCF  Division officials told us that they will collaborate with the responsible  business line office to conduct a business process analysis, which is used  to identify actionable ways to address the cause of the high service  volume and costs in specific circumstances.
As such, WCF Division officials  told us that they can support those offices by monitoring their usage and  helping to identify actions to reduce high service volume and costs, but it  is ultimately the business line offices’ responsibility to implement any  changes to their own processes to improve service usage."

786,"DSCA has established internal guidance for its two main  management oversight processes to monitor for significant changes in the  FMS transportation account balance—a daily review and annual review— but this guidance is unclear and lacks key details.
Lack of Internal Guidance  Regarding Annual Reports Has  Contributed to Incomplete  Reporting For fiscal years 2015 to 2018, DSCA produced annual reports assessing  the financial health of FMS transportation accounts that contained  incomplete information because DSCA did not use rigorous methods to  determine the underlying causes for trends in the accounts.
When discussing reasons for  year-to-year account balance increases, DSCA’s reports stated they were  mainly due to a decline in oil prices and a legal change that DOD  implemented in July 2014 that allowed TRANSCOM to charge lower DOD  rates for FMS air shipments, both of which could likely affect expenditures  from the account.
According to Navy officials,  because researching the individual transportation fees for each FMS  shipment was time-consuming and they lacked clear guidance about  how much data DSCA needed for its rate review, they decided to  provide related fee data on 103, or 3 percent, of the 3,536 air  shipments for which Navy had cost data.
In particular, DSCA’s data  requests stated that each military department should provide at least 20  cost and fee comparisons for each fee rate for each of the FMS  transportation accounts, and requested that these data include as many  different foreign partners or FMS cases as possible.
According to DSCA officials, DSCA is considering  conducting its next transportation fee rate review in fiscal year 2020, with  a goal of lowering the FMS transportation account balances.
This updated  internal guidance should be based on consultations with the military  departments, DFAS, and TRANSCOM on which sources of transportation  cost and fee data are the most reliable and comparable for use in its FMS  transportation fee rate reviews.
Regarding instances when DOD charges FMS purchasers  estimated transportation prices instead of a transportation fee rate, we  reviewed DSCA guidance on this process in the Security Assistance  Management Manual against related federal internal control standards."
787,"The additional actions stated in Executive Order 13548  specified that federal agencies were to implement strategies for retaining  federal workers with disabilities in federal employment, to make increased  use of Schedule A excepted hiring authority for persons with disabilities,  and to designate a senior-level official to be accountable for meeting the  goals of the order and developing and implementing the agency’s plan.
The revised regulation requires that agencies take specific steps until  they meet specific employment goals set by EEOC for individuals with  disabilities and targeted disabilities, provide personal assistance services  to certain employees who need them because of a targeted disability, and  meet a number of other requirements designed to improve employment  opportunities for individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce.
SSA officials told us their agency holds annual mandatory training for  managers and human resource specialists on special hiring  authorities that apply to individuals with disabilities, including  Schedule A, and reasonable accommodations.
Selected agencies implemented a number of practices that helped bolster  their recruitment and hiring of persons with disabilities, including  collaborating with other federal agencies for knowledge and information  sharing, coordinating efforts with employee resource or advisory groups,  and providing additional training for hiring managers and human  resources staff on using Schedule A hiring authority—one of the  commonly used hiring flexibilities available to agencies to onboard  qualified individuals with disabilities.
For example, OPM could track and report such data by  General Schedule level pay groupings, which could help pinpoint root  causes that contribute to retention rates, inform assessments of  government-wide progress on employee retention, and identify needed  improvements.
(Recommendation 1) We are making the following recommendations to DOJ:  The Attorney General of the United States should develop and implement  policies and procedures for assessing the impact of training provided to  agency hiring managers and human resources staff on Schedule A hiring  authority."
788,"Bonds that  are high enough to cover all reclamation costs provide complete financial  assurance to prevent orphaned wells because, in the event that an  operator does not reclaim its wells, BLM can use the bond to pay for  reclamation.
In the absence of bond  levels that more closely reflect expected reclamation costs, such as by  increasing regulatory minimums and incorporating consideration of the  number of wells on each bond and their characteristics, BLM will continue  to face risks that its bonds will not provide sufficient financial assurance to  prevent orphaned wells.
Authorizing and requiring the implementation of a  mechanism to obtain funds from oil and gas operators to cover the costs  of reclamation could help ensure BLM can completely and timely reclaim  wells.
At-risk wells: To identify wells that may be at greater risk of becoming  orphaned and determine whether their bonds are sufficient to cover  potential reclamation costs, we used well production data from the  Office of Natural Resources Revenue’s Oil and Gas Operations  Report (OGOR) as of June 2017 and bond values from LR2000."
789,"REAC primarily uses contractors—who are trained and certified in  REAC’s Uniform Physical Condition Standards protocol—to conduct  inspections of multifamily and public housing properties.
The PASS Quality  Assurance division evaluates and monitors REAC’s inspection  program to ensure reliable, replicable, and reasonable inspections;  trains contract and quality assurance inspectors; and provides  technical assistance to HUD-assisted properties and other relevant  stakeholders.
HUD Offices Involved in  Monitoring and  Enforcement of Physical  Condition Standards HUD’s PIH, Multifamily Housing, and Departmental Enforcement Center  are responsible for ensuring that the owners of REAC-inspected  properties (including PHAs) correct the identified physical deficiencies.
Completed inspections receive two  levels of review by REAC quality assurance staff, who use software  that compares certain aspects of the current and previous  inspections—such as inspection scores, property profiles (for  example, number of units), site measurements, and time taken to  complete the inspection—and highlights large variances.
This review process requires a REAC quality  assurance inspector to conduct a second inspection of the same  property, including selecting the same sample of buildings and units of  the original inspection.
Participants in three of the  five discussion groups we held with contract and quality assurance  inspectors said that the inspection process provides a comprehensive  review of a property and that the inspection software helps promote  consistency in inspections.
REAC officials stated that they understand the importance of conducting  a comprehensive review of the inspection process similar to what they did  in 2001 but that they have focused their staff and resources on other  priorities—for example, upgrading their technology and quality assurance  processes, hiring and training quality assurance inspectors, and  conducting targeted assessments of their inspection process in reaction  to specific events or risks.
In addition, REAC staff told us that some contract inspector candidates  have inspection experience based on inspections that are not as rigorous  as those conducted using the Uniform Physical Condition Standards  protocol.
Participants in three of the four discussion groups we held with  REAC quality assurance inspectors and supervisors told us that they had  trained candidates who had included information on their applications  about previous inspection experience that was not well matched to  REAC’s inspection process.
Quality Assurance  Inspector Training  Requirements May Not  Cover All Job Duties and  Are Not Documented REAC’s quality assurance inspectors—who train and oversee contract  inspectors—must be able to conduct physical inspections of properties as  well as assess contract inspectors’ performance.
According to REAC officials, REAC’s quality assurance inspectors receive  the same training as contract inspectors on the Uniform Physical  Condition Standards inspection protocol.
However, if REAC is unable to  meet its management targets for CQA reviews, it may not be able to  consistently produce high-quality inspections because it is not providing  routine opportunities for contract inspectors to receive coaching from  quality assurance inspectors, which could include addressing deficiencies  that the contract inspectors did not initially identify and record.
For example, for our first  recommendation on conducting a comprehensive review of REAC’s  physical inspection process, HUD noted in its written comments that it  plans to develop new standards, protocols, scoring approaches, and  software to be validated through a demonstration.
We analyzed the  data to determine, for example, how often contract inspectors were  conducting inspections in accordance with REAC’s Uniform Physical  Conditions Standards protocol and its quality assurance standard  operating procedures, and how often REAC was meeting its goals for  timeliness and frequency of reviews."

791,"However, these assessments do not analyze sanctions’ overall  effectiveness in achieving broader U.S. policy goals or objectives, such  as whether the sanctions are advancing the national security and policy  priorities of the United States, according to Treasury officials.
However, according to Treasury, State, and Commerce, agency  assessments of sanctions’ impacts often contribute to broader  interagency discussions, typically coordinated through the NSC, that  examine the effectiveness of sanctions in achieving policy goals.
In addition, OFAC officials stated that the Office of  International Affairs often participates in agency discussions and may  provide verbal or written assessments of sanctions’ impact on foreign  partners’ industries and markets as well as on U.S. companies.
According to SPI officials, they commissioned the study because they  wanted to understand the specific impact of sanctions on a country that  was already facing economic challenges, given that sanctions were  among several foreign policy tools used to address Russian behavior.
According to Treasury, State, and Commerce officials, given these  difficulties and limited resources, they do not conduct their own  assessments of the overall effectiveness of existing sanctions programs  in achieving broad policy goals.
Moreover, Treasury, State, and Commerce stated that agency  assessments of sanctions’ impacts often contribute to broader  interagency discussions, typically coordinated through the NSC, that  examine the effectiveness of sanctions in achieving broad policy goals.

792,"To estimate improper payments in Medicare and Medicaid FFS,  respectively, CMS’s CERT and PERM contractors randomly sample and  manually review medical record documentation associated with FFS  claims for payment from providers, also known as medical reviews.
In addition to having similar outreach to providers for obtaining  documentation, the CERT and PERM contractors also have processes to  refer suspected fraud to the appropriate program integrity entity, to  ensure the accuracy of medical reviews, and to allow providers to dispute  improper payment determinations.
At the state  level, however, CMS officials told us that the PERM contractor’s medical  reviews do not generate statistically generalizable information about  improper payments by service type and, as a result, they do not provide  robust state-specific information on the corrective actions needed to  address the underlying causes of improper payments.
Without estimates  that provide information on the most prevalent underlying causes of  improper payments within a state, particularly by service type, a state  Medicaid agency may not be able to develop appropriate corrective  actions or prioritize activities to effectively address program risks."
793,"The six policies in  effect as of July 2019 for the selected populations provide direction and  guidance to ERO officers on the identification, detention, care, and  removal of aliens who are: individuals with mental disorders, transgender,  individuals with disabilities, parents of minors, pregnant, and juveniles.
Our analysis of ICE data shows that the  number of detentions of individuals with mental disorders at IHSC-staffed  facilities varied from calendar years 2015 through 2018 but increased  overall from 8513 to 8796 individuals.
Our analysis of ICE data shows that the number of  detentions of nursing women at IHSC-staffed facilities varied from  calendar years 2015 through 2018 but increased overall from 157 in 2015  to 381 in 2018.
Detentions of Individuals with  Disabilities Increased from  2017 to 2018; the Majority  Resulted from ICE Arrests and  Were Detentions of Convicted  Criminals ICE began collecting and maintaining data on certain detainees with  disabilities–i.e., those with communication and mobility impairments— who disclosed their impairment or who were identified by facility staff as  having an impairment in January 2017, in accordance with its directive,  titled Assessment and Accommodations for Detainees with Disabilities.
To address our first question, we analyzed individual-level data from the  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Integrated Decision  Support (IIDS) database, to determine the total number of ICE  Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) administrative arrests  (arrests), detentions, and removals from January 2015 (the start of the  Priority Enforcement Program) through December 2018 (to include the  first two years for the 2017 DHS Memo).
Pregnant Women: We matched ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC)  records for pregnant women in ERO custody during calendar years  2016 through 2018 with IIDS individual-level detention data to  determine the total number of detentions of pregnant women, as well  as the number of detentions by arresting agency, criminality, and  length of detention.
Appendix II: Enforcement and Removal  Operations Arrests, Detentions, and  Removals, 2015-2018 The number of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO)  administrative arrests (arrests) by gender, country of citizenship, ICE  enforcement program, criminality, and area of responsibility from  calendar years 2015 through 2018.
We analyzed individual-level Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE) data to identify ERO arrests, detentions, and removals during  calendar years 2015 through 2018.
Arrests of individuals from  federal, state and local prisons and jails, through the Criminal Alien  Program, accounted for the majority (ranging from 72 to 76 percent) of  ERO arrests each calendar year from 2015 through 2018, as shown in  figure 9.
We analyzed individual- level Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data to identify ERO  arrests, detentions, and removals of males during calendar years 2015  through 2018.
We analyzed individual- level Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data to identify ERO  arrests, detentions, and removals of females during calendar years 2015  through 2018.

794,"Based on our  body of work on the IRIS Program, the program’s importance has  increased over time as EPA program offices and regions have  increasingly relied on IRIS chemical assessments in making  environmental protection and risk management decisions.
To address the length of time it takes to produce assessments, the IRIS  Program is (1) employing project management principles and specialized  software that enable the program to better plan assessment schedules  and utilize staff to make the systematic review process more efficient; (2)  focusing on better scoping assessments to create timely, fit-for-purpose  products that address specific agency needs; and (3) streamlining the  peer review process as much as possible.
IRIS officials said the idea is that instead of producing a  wide-ranging assessment, the program can produce assessments that  are more limited in scope and targeted to specific program and regional  office needs, reducing the amount of time IRIS staff needed to search for  information, synthesize it and draft, review, and issue an assessment.
For example, one industry representative  expressed concern in August 2018 about transparency before the  program began making changes, describing the IRIS Program as a “black  box” because “no one knew how the program created its methodologies,  weighted evidence, or produced assessments.” In response, the IRIS  Program has in the past several years (1) implemented systematic  review, which provides a structured and transparent process for  identifying relevant studies, reviewing their methodological strengths and  weaknesses, and integrating these studies as part of a weight of evidence  analysis, and (2) increased outreach efforts with stakeholders and the  public, both in terms of the frequency and the depth of content about  assessment preparation.
However, EPA faces key challenges to its ability to implement TSCA,  such as managing the risks posed by ongoing litigation, ensuring  appropriate resources, developing guidance to ensure consistency, and  ensuring that the new chemicals review process is efficient and  predictable.
Representatives from one environmental  stakeholder organization told us in July 2018 that it is still too early to  assess how well EPA is implementing TSCA because none of the existing  chemical risk evaluations ongoing under the new process have been  released; the wording in the new rules and documentation is unclear; and  the risk prioritization rule, the risk evaluation rule, and the inventory reset  rule have been challenged in court.
As of  December 2018, representatives from another environmental stakeholder  group told us that, while EPA has met a number of major statutory  deadlines, the agency’s rules and other actions do not reflect the best  available science and are contrary to both the letter and intent of the new  TSCA Act. However, in January 2019 an industry stakeholder  organization noted that the 2016 amendments to TSCA are generally  being implemented effectively and efficiently as Congress envisioned,  and the agency continues to meet important deadlines required by the  law."
795,"In March 2019, TRIO  dissolved and transitioned oversight and operations to the BODs. In addition to the working groups that were established to implement  TCJA, IRS also relied on its usual practices for implementation of tax law  changes, including developing guidance, training employees, and  updating technology systems:  Determining appropriate guidance for release.
IRS officials stated that there were several benefits to this enhanced  collaborative approach, including: more efficient and effective development of comprehensive  regulations, for instance guidance for the QBI provision;  faster decision-making on time-sensitive regulations; earlier identification of tax administration and enforcement concerns; mitigation of potential enforcement challenges, such as narrowing the  definition of specified trades and businesses on the QBI deduction;  and ability to begin compliance planning earlier.
Treasury’s Economic  Analyses Omit Key  Considerations of  Distributional Effects  of Tax Regulations While developing regulations to help implement and administer TCJA  provisions, Treasury and IRS made discretionary decisions in the  regulatory development process that have meaningful effects on  taxpayers’ tax liability and government revenue collection that were not  included in their analysis.
Treasury’s and IRS’s significant proposed and final rules used to  implement TCJA included a section analyzing the impact of the  regulations; however, we found these analyses generally overlooked the  distributional effects of the regulations arising from changes in tax liability  and revenue collection.
While Treasury was unable to issue all final regulations within the 18- month time frame and before taxpayers needed to begin filing tax returns  affected by TCJA changes, IRS took actions to mitigate the potential  impact of the lack of final guidance.
The distributional  effects of tax liability changes from regulations can be significant;  updating Treasury’s internal guidance to include analysis of these effects  in the rulemaking process would provide greater transparency to the  public, and would better inform decision makers who must determine  which regulatory alternative is the best to adopt.
We maintain that decisions Treasury and IRS made when developing  regulations to implement TCJA could potentially impact tax liability by  billions of dollars per year; however, Treasury’s internal guidance dictates  that these revenue effects should not be included in its economic  analyses of the regulations.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report (1) examines the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) processes  that it has in place to provide guidance to taxpayers on Public Law 115- 97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA)  business and international provisions; (2) assesses the economic  analyses Department of the Treasury (Treasury) conducted as part of the  regulatory development process; (3) evaluates IRS monitoring of  implementation of these provisions and describes implementation status;  and (4) examines any challenges that could affect IRS’s ability to  effectively administer these provisions.
We also reviewed IRS documentation on internal  coordination and interviewed IRS TRIO and Chief Counsel officials to  examine IRS’s strategy for and process of guidance development and  IRS’s plan to provide taxpayers with timely information."
796,"The FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (2016 FOIA amendment)  addressed procedural issues, including requiring that agencies (1)  make records available in an electronic format if they have been  requested three or more times; (2) notify requesters that they have not  less than 90 days to file an administrative appeal, and (3) provide  dispute resolution services at various times throughout the FOIA  process.
In doing so, we noted  that USCIS and ICE engaged in duplicative processing of FOIA requests  for those immigration files containing documents related to law  enforcement activities that were generated by ICE."
797,"DOD Pilot and Pathfinder  Efforts Provided Additional  Information to the  Wideband AOA Study  Team The Air Force and Defense Information Systems Agency conducted  interrelated pilot and pathfinder studies before and during the Wideband  AOA that provided information on SATCOM business arrangements, user  terminal prototyping, and acquisition efficiencies.
The Wideband AOA report  identified three of the 11 potential architectures that would best meet  DOD’s wideband SATCOM needs: Legacy Purpose-Built and Commercial Contracting Architecture -  Procure and field a new purpose-built constellation for X and Ka-band  capabilities with anti-jam technologies and upgraded antennas.
According to officials we spoke with  from various DOD organizations involved in the Wideband AOA and  SATCOM acquisitions, they have work ongoing that provides relevant  information, including Air Force pathfinders and a study of ground  infrastructure supporting WGS.
However, these officials told us that there  is no formal plan to guide post-AOA efforts including coordinating and  providing the knowledge DOD needs to mitigate risks and inform timely  decisions on DOD’s next wideband communications architecture."
798,"Methodology DOD Uses to  Calculate Improper  Payment Amounts and  Rates To comply with IPIA and OMB requirements, and in response to our prior  recommendations, DFAS updated its statistical sampling plan in fiscal  year 2017 to develop and report improper payment estimates for DTS.
DOD Has Taken  Steps to Implement  Its Remediation Plan,  but Its Approach May  Not Manage Risk  Sufficiently, Many  Actions Remain  Incomplete, and  Communication of  Requirements Was  Lacking DOD established and has taken steps to implement a Remediation Plan  aimed at reducing improper travel payments that includes specific  requirements for all DOD components as well as a committee to monitor  the efforts of 10 components that DOD identified as key to addressing  improper travel payments.
Specifically, it stated that the military services, defense  agencies, DOD field activities, Joint Staff, and combatant commands  must each designate in writing a Senior Accountable Official (SAO)  responsible for implementing the plan’s requirements for that component,  train travelers and approving officials, issue guidance on holding  approving officials pecuniarily liable for improper travel payments, and  prepare component-specific remediation plans and identify corrective  actions, among other things.
First, a 2016 DODIG report on improper  travel payments presented the results of a DFAS review of DTS vouchers  for 58 DOD components for July through December, 2014, including 48  components not represented on DOD’s SAO committee.
Further, these components indicated that their SAOs  had completed some required steps, such as issuing guidance to ensure  that front-end internal controls were in place to prevent improper travel  payments; reviewing training plans to determine their effectiveness in  preventing improper travel payments; and providing initial or refresher  training to all travelers and approving officials, among other actions.
At the meeting,  the DOD Deputy Chief Financial Officer, serving as the chair of the  committee, emphasized that components needed to document progress  in order to demonstrate that the department was working toward  identifying root causes and implementing corrective action plans to  prevent and reduce improper travel payments."
799,"Some  of the steps the Coast Guard has taken align with leading practices for  managing public sector backlogs and key practices for managing risks to  critical infrastructure, including identifying risks posed by the lack of timely  investment, identifying mission-critical facilities, disposing of unneeded  assets, and beginning an assessment of shore infrastructure  vulnerabilities.
Without a complete understanding of both the vulnerabilities of its  infrastructure and the consequences to its mission operations if its  infrastructure is damaged, the Coast Guard risks questionable  recapitalization investments for improving resilience when selecting  projects to fund."
800,"To produce these subpopulation indexes, BLS adjusts the relative  importance of price changes in each good and service through a process  sometimes referred to as “reweighting,” meaning BLS develops alternate  sets of expenditure weights that reflect the spending patterns of the  subpopulation.
BLS officials acknowledged that updating the weights more frequently  would make the index more relevant, though they did not believe using  the Consumer Expenditure Survey to do so was practical in part because  they said it would require additional costs to increase the sample size.
Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom are all using their  National Accounts data to supplement expenditure survey data in their  CPIs, while New Zealand is also using another form of government- collected administrative data to improve its CPIs. International Guidance for Calculating CPIs and Subpopulation  Indexes  The International Labour Organization produces a manual that provides  an overview of issues that national statistical offices can consider when  making decisions on how to deal with the various problems in the  compilation of Consumer Price Indexes.
Australia’s statistical agency uses consumption data from  their National Accounts to update the CPI expenditure weights more  frequently than officials said was previously possible.
In 2018, the Australian statistical agency incorporated  National Accounts data in the CPI in those years when the  expenditure survey was not conducted, allowing the expenditure  weights to be updated annually to reflect what statistical agency  officials described as more timely and relevant consumption patterns  and to improve the accuracy of the data.
By incorporating consumption data from the National Accounts,  Australian statistical agency officials said they can generate more  timely and relevant CPI measures, including the subpopulation  indexes.
New Zealand’s statistical agency also uses National  Accounts data to estimate expenditure weights for insurance services,  which are relatively difficult to measure in survey data, according to  agency officials."
801,"Officials of both OFAC and Treasury’s Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Management cited three primary challenges in hiring  candidates with the necessary qualifications: Competition with other agencies, including those in the intelligence community, which can use direct-hire authority to expedite the hiring process Competition with the private sector, which offers higher salaries The time required for security clearance processing, which delays hiring for positions, such as sanctions investigators, who need a special sensitive investigation that must be adjudicated at the top secret/sensitive compartmented information levelTreasury does not currently have direct-hire authority for OFAC but can  use other authorities to address hiring challenges.
Agencies Provide  Information on  Sanctions Activities  and Expenses in  Selected Mandated  Reports OFAC and State each prepare and submit reports in response to the  requirements of the IEEPA and the NEA.
OFAC’s NEA-mandated reports generally include information on  expenditures reported by Treasury and State and by any other agencies  identified in the relevant executive order.
OFAC’s Mandated NEA  Reports Include Expenses  for Agencies with Roles in  Sanctions Implementation,  while State’s Have  Reported No Expenditures IEEPA Reporting on Sanctions  Activities Both OFAC and State include information on actions taken to implement  sanctions programs in response to the requirements of the IEEPA.
Key agencies that implement  sanctions have generally received steady or growing resources in recent  years, but Treasury and State have staffing gaps and face challenges in  securing the staff needed to fill their authorized positions.
We reviewed agency performance reports and annual reports  and interviewed agency officials representing Treasury, State, and  Commerce units that focus primarily on sanctions implementation, to  identify any additional information the agencies had that could measure  changes in agency workload over time."
802,"Programs in breach  are required to notify their acquisition decision authority and develop a  remediation plan that outlines a timeframe for the program to return to its  APB parameters, re-baseline—that is, establish new schedule, cost, or  performance goals—or have a DHS-led program review that results in  recommendations for a revised baseline.
DHS leadership approved revised baselines for these five programs  following various actions by the program offices such as: Customs and Border Protection’s Automated Commercial  Environment breached its cost and schedule goals in April 2017,  which Customs and Border Protection officials attribute to an  underestimation of the level of effort needed to complete  development.
U.S. Coast Guard’s Polar Security Cutter met established cost and  schedule milestones between January 2018 and August 2019, but  program officials stated that they anticipate a schedule slip because  delivery of the lead ship in the awarded contract is two months after  the program’s APB threshold date.
ACE continued deployment of the Core functionality and updated acquisition  documents including the program’s acquisition program baseline (APB) and life-cycle  cost estimate (LCCE) to reflect the program changes.
In May 2018, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership approved BEE’s  initial acquisition program baseline (APB) which established the cost, schedule, and  performance parameters for the air segment.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to establish cost, schedule, and  performance goals for each individual segment of the border wall system in separate  acquisition program baselines (APB) as funding becomes available.
05/19 FY 2018 APB revised/ FY19 initial APB approved 03/23 FY 2018 segments full operational capability (FOC) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) In November 2017, the Science and Technology Directorate’s Office of Systems  Engineering completed a technical assessment on the program and identified risks  related to the integration and operation of enforcement zone technologies—such  as cameras and sensors—which had not been clearly defined or planned for within  the wall system.
CBP officials told GAO that the program  experienced delays in updating the acquisition documents—including the operational  requirements document—for the detection capability as a result of continued work  with stakeholders.
The program declared a potential schedule breach in December 2017 because the  program did not receive funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  to address new IFT requirements, including camera upgrades and replacement of  existing tower systems deployed in Tuscon and Ajo under a legacy program.
In January 2015, Border Patrol requested the program prioritize replacing  these legacy systems because the technology was obsolete and more expensive to  maintain than IFT technology planned for deployment in other AoRs. 10/15 Initial operational  capability (Nogales) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) INTEGRATED FIXED TOWERS (IFT) Previously, the OTA found that the program met only 2 of its 3 KPPs and experienced  five operational deficiencies during a limited user test conducted in the Nogales  AoR in November 2015.
To mitigate capability gaps  resulting from the tower reduction, Border Patrol requested the program deploy two  additional IFT camera suites in Ajo. DHS leadership directed CBP to develop a border technology plan that includes IFT  capabilities.
The program previously experienced cost increases after  accommodating a change in DHS’s appropriations structure and schedule slips  because of a directive from DHS to develop a comprehensive border plan, which  contributed to delays in getting approvals for some of the documents required for  ADE 3.
The updated LCCE also removes personnel costs included in the  program’s initial APB, which CBP officials previously told GAO are funded through a  separate, central funding account for all of CBP’s air and marine assets.
In February 2019, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership approved a  revised acquisition program baseline (APB), which increased the program’s quantity  to 29 MEA: 16 previously approved maritime interdiction MEA and 13 additional air  interdiction MEA.
However, in April 2019, DHS leadership directed CBP  to complete follow-on operational test and evaluation (OT&E) of the air interdiction  configuration and undergo an acquisition decision event (ADE) 3 review before the  program could receive full-rate production approval.
CBP officials told GAO that they are developing acquisition  documentation to inform acquisition decision event 1 for the follow-on NII program  planned for September 2019, including a concept of operations and an initial cost  estimate.
CBP officials previously told GAO the program anticipated conducting its ADE 2A  and obtaining DHS leadership approval for an acquisition program baseline (APB)  establishing cost, schedule and performance goals for the expanded program by  December 2018.
In May 2019, CISA officials said the program is updating key acquisition documentation,  such as its acquisition program baseline (APB) and LCCE, to inform acquisition  decision event (ADE) 2B for Data Management Protection capabilities.
In June 2019, CISA officials  stated they were working on enhancements to address E In January 2018, DOT&E determined that it was too soon to assess block 2.2 based  on the OA results from October 2017, but noted block 2.2 was at risk of not meeting  user needs and made a number of recommendations, including reviewing the ORD  and CONOPS and repeating the OA before conducting initial OT&E.
In September 2019, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership granted  the program approval of acquisition decision event (ADE) 3 and acknowledged the  program’s achievement of full operational capability (FOC).
FEMA initially deployed the enhanced LSCMS in 2013  without DHS leadership approval, a DOT&E letter of assessment, or a DHS-approved  APB documenting the program’s costs, schedule, and performance parameters, as  required by DHS’s acquisition policy.
In March 2018, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership approved the  program’s revised acquisition program baseline (APB), removing it from breach status,  which USCG officials primarily attributed to underestimating the technical effort  necessary to meet requirements.
In July 2019, USCG  officials said they do not plan to update the program’s APB for the upcoming ADEs  because the program is on track and does not require changes to its cost, schedule,  or performance goals.
In April 2019, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership approved a change  to the program’s current acquisition program baseline (APB) to adjust the program’s  schedule milestones as a result of the fiscal year 2019 partial government shutdown.
In January 2018, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership approved the  program’s initial acquisition program baseline (APB), establishing cost, schedule, and  performance goals.
DHS policy establishes that all major  acquisition programs should have a department-approved APB, which  establishes a program’s critical cost, schedule, and performance  parameters, before they initiate efforts to obtain new capabilities."
803,"For example, the FBI drafts privacy documentation for its face recognition  capabilities, and DOJ offices review and approve key documents  developed by the FBI—such as PIAs and SORNs. DOJ and FBI Have  Taken Steps Since  May 2016 to Better  Ensure Privacy but  Work Remains to  Fully Address Prior  Recommendations DOJ Has Taken Steps to  More Quickly Publish  Privacy Impact  Assessments but Has Not  Fully Implemented Its  Revised Process We reported in May 2016 that the FBI did not (1) update the NGI-IPS PIA  in a timely manner when the system underwent significant changes, or (2)  develop and publish a PIA for FACE Services before that unit began  supporting FBI agents.
We concluded that by conducting an  operational review of these systems, FBI officials would obtain  information regarding what factors affect the accuracy of the face  recognition searches, such as the quality of the photos in the database,  and if NGI-IPS is meeting federal, state, and local law enforcement  needs.
As a result, we recommended the FBI conduct an operational  review of NGI-IPS, at least annually, that includes an assessment of the  accuracy of face recognition searches and take actions, as necessary, to  improve the system."
804,"In a 2015 report on FHLBank board governance, we found that FHFA and  FHLBanks had taken steps to increase board diversity, including creating  regulations that encouraged the banks to consider diversity in board  candidate selection and developing processes to identify and nominate  independent directors.
In May 2015, FHFA amended the 2010 rule and added two reporting  requirements for the annual reports: (1) data on gender and race/ethnicity  of board directors (which the directors would voluntarily self-report), and  (2) information on the banks’ outreach efforts (such as to promote  diversity when nominating and soliciting director candidates).
FHFA staff said in preparation for their 2017 FHLBank board  analysis, they informally monitored the gender and minority status of the  additional independent director seats filled by the seven banks that  accepted the offer.
As allowed by FHFA regulation, FHLBanks varied in the data collection  forms they used, questions they asked, and methods they used to  distribute forms to board directors to obtain self-reported gender and  race/ethnicity information.
FHFA has implemented some efforts on improving the quality of the data  FHLBanks report to the agency, but FHFA staff told us that such efforts  have not included a review of how the banks collect board director  demographic data.
Recommendation for  Executive Action The Director of FHFA’s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion, in  consultation with FHLBanks, should conduct a review on each bank’s  processes for collecting gender and race/ethnicity data from boards of  directors and communicate effective practices to FHLBanks."
805,"Billing: FDA’s process related to quarterly tobacco user fee billing  includes procedures to ensure the invoices it creates for individual  tobacco manufacturers and importers are complete and accurate—based  on CTP’s market share percentages calculated using the monthly excise  tax data submitted to FDA by manufacturers and importers—and mailed  in a timely manner.
As designed, the year-end reconciliation  includes steps for FDA to compare the  information the agency used to calculate  quarterly user fees with independent  information obtained from TTB and CBP on  the individual tobacco manufacturers and  importers who paid tobacco excise taxes (to  ensure FDA has a complete list of those who  should pay user fees) and the amounts paid  (to ensure FDA used the right amounts to  calculate market share and user fees).
FDA officials stated that FDA can apply necessary  market share adjustments to individual user fee assessments in a  subsequent quarterly invoicing cycle, or after the agency completes its  year-end reconciliation process based on annual tax data from TTB and  CBP."
806,"Given DOT’s authority to oversee certain aspects of the industry, we  made four recommendations to DOT in 2017 to increase transparency  and obtain information to better inform their oversight of the air  ambulance industry: (1) communicating a method to receive air  ambulance complaints, including those regarding balance billing; (2)  taking steps to make complaint information publicly available; (3)  assessing available federal and industry data to determine what  information could assist in the evaluation of future complaints; and (4)  considering consumer disclosure requirements for air ambulance  providers, such as established prices charged and the extent of  contracting with insurers.
For example, one air ambulance provider told us that one  way it evaluates the need for a new base in an area is to ask hospitals in  that area about the number of transports they typically require and the  length of time it takes helicopters to arrive to pick up patients."
807,"When patients use these take-back options, the drugs they  dispose of are ultimately incinerated, which is the only method that DEA  officials said is known to render the drugs non-retrievable, that is,  permanently and irreversibly destroyed.
Studies indicate that patients who receive an in-home disposal product  may be more likely to dispose of unused opioids, but they may also be  less likely to use federally recommended options like take-back or  flushing."
808,"DOD has not fully implemented seven of our recommendations related to  its supply chain challenges: Revise sustainment plans: In October 2017, we reported that DOD’s  reactive approach to planning for and funding the capabilities needed  to sustain the F-35 resulted in significant readiness challenges— including delays in the establishment of part repair capabilities at the  depots—and placed DOD at risk of being unable to leverage the  capabilities of the aircraft it had purchased.
Conduct a comprehensive review of the F-35 supply chain: While  DOD had ongoing efforts to increase the availability of spare parts, we  found in April 2019 that DOD would likely continue to face challenges  because the program was not planning for the quantity of parts  necessary in its spare parts projections to meet warfighter  requirements.
DOD has not fully implemented 10 of our recommendations related to  these issues: Develop a long-term Intellectual Property strategy: In September  2014, we reported that DOD had not identified all of the technical data  it needs from the contractor, and at what cost, to enable competition  of future sustainment contracts, which put the program at risk of not  having the flexibility to make changes to its sustainment strategy."
809,"Exempt Organizations  Examination staff developed many of the queries, based on information  collected on the Form 990 after it was redesigned for tax year 2008,  according to TE/GE officials.
Although the models screen for  examination status and statute of limitations, a TE/GE official said the  classifier also checks whether the statute of limitations date is near and  whether the organization recently had undergone an examination or  compliance check, as well as whether the return was identified under  another selection method.
Processing Queries for the  Model Did Not Always Produce  Quality Information We found several issues with TE/GE’s processing of queries in the Form  990, 990-EZ and 990-PF models that affect the validity or reliability of the  scores that the models generate to rank returns for examination selection  (see figure 7).
On the other hand, TE/GE did not provide similar start-to-finish  documentation on processing quality information from other examination  sources that use data outside of the models; examples include research  projects under the Data Driven Approaches portfolio and projects that use  queries under the Referrals and Other Casework portfolio (see table 1).
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following 13 recommendations to IRS:  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should document measurable  objectives for using data in selecting exempt organization returns for  examination.
(Recommendation 4) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should more fully document how  TE/GE processes data and uses data to make examination selection  decisions for sources outside of the model such as research projects and  other projects that use queries.
(Recommendation 6) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should establish a process for  regularly evaluating selection decisions and related outcomes for the  models and other processes that use data to select returns for  examinations.
(Recommendation 12) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should document why TE/GE has  not identified any risks in its risk register for using data to select exempt  organization returns for examination.
In addition, although IRS agreed with our recommendation to more fully  document how TE/GE processes and uses data to make examination  selection decisions outside of the model (Recommendation 5), IRS said  that it would provide documentation on a project (other than compliance  strategies) that is approved by the Governance Board.
To assess the use of data to select tax-exempt organization returns for  examination, we reviewed data from the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS)  Returns Inventory and Classification System (RICS) for fiscal years 2016  to 2019.
To inform this work, we reviewed  recent TE/GE contractor assessments of exempt organization  examination selection and the Form 990 model."
810,"American Samoa has a combined land area of 76 square miles, slightly  larger than Washington, D.C. Approximately 98 percent of the population of American Samoa lives on  the main island of Tutuila, and most economic activity (including tuna  canning) and government operations take place in and around the harbor  of the capital city, Pago Pago, on Tutuila (see fig.
In addition to increased competition and labor  market challenges, the industry faces other challenges, such as lower  wages relative to those in American Samoa for cannery workers in other  tuna-exporting countries.
According to an industry official, one prominent tuna exporting  country offers wages as low as $10 dollars per day, whereas a full- time worker in 2020 at the cannery in American Samoa would earn  over $44 per day.
According to data provided by  StarKist Samoa, most cannery workers in American Samoa would be  impacted by a minimum wage increase.
Both expressed concerns about the reliance of American  Samoa’s economy on the tuna canning industry and the potential  negative impact of minimum wage increases on the remaining cannery in  American Samoa.
Such a  study was beyond the scope of this report, which focused on (1)  economic trends including changes in employment and earnings since  the minimum wage increases in American Samoa began in 2007, (2) the  status of the tuna canning industry, and (3) stakeholder views on the  minimum wage increases.
To examine stakeholder views on the minimum wage  increases, we conducted interviews with officials from the American  Samoa government and American Samoa Chamber of Commerce, and  employers and workers from the public and private sectors.
To estimate employment and earnings for non-cannery workers in the  private sector, we relied on individual-level tax data that we obtained from  the American Samoa Departments of Commerce and Treasury.
In accordance with other federal employment surveys and with  our employer questionnaires for our 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2016 reports  on the impact of minimum wage increases in American Samoa, our  employer questionnaire requested employment and wage data for mid- June pay periods in 2016, 2017, and 2018 from American Samoa’s tuna  canning industry—in this case, the territory’s one remaining cannery,  StarKist Samoa.
During our fieldwork trip to  American Samoa in October 2019, we conducted interviews with  government officials, employers, other private sector representatives, and  workers to obtain views and information on the minimum wage increases."
811,"Specifically, for contracts or agreements with private entities, the  provisions of the act state, in part:  in general, for major disaster assistance activities, agencies shall  provide a preference, to the extent feasible and practicable, to  organizations, firms, and individuals residing or doing business  primarily in the area affected by the major disaster or emergency;  they may be set aside for local vendors, which means that only  vendors residing or primarily doing business in the declared  disaster area are allowed to compete for an award;  those not awarded to local vendors shall be justified in writing in  the contract file.
Additionally,  FEMA officials from the Recovery Support Function Leadership  Group’s Program Management Office stated that they use the NIA  code to track government-wide contracting related to recovery efforts.
When we  requested supporting documentation and analysis, DHS OCPO  officials provided some correspondence with FEMA but did not  provide government-wide data analysis to identify what other  agencies were awarding and executing contracts related to these  events.
Moreover, DHS OCPO officials were unable to provide data analysis  conducted using available data from prior events to determine historical  patterns in federal contracting obligations for disasters prior to closing the  codes for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Agencies We Reviewed  Experienced Challenges  Contracting with Local  Vendors Steps to Implement Local Vendor  Preference, as Outlined in the Post-Katrina  Emergency Management Reform Act and  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  Step 1: Identify the set-aside area in  accordance with FAR § 26.202-1—Local Area  Set-Aside and § 6.208—Set-asides for Local  Firms During a Major Disaster or Emergency  Step 2: Conduct market research to  determine whether there are qualified vendors  in the set-aside area.
Contracting officials responsible for these debris removal  contracts stated they were not aware of a policy or regulation for how to  identify the geographic area for a local area set-aside, but that their office  had internally determined the use of congressional districts impacted by a  disaster to be the preferred method.
Without  additional guidance or related training, contracting officers may be  unaware of how to define the geographic area for a local area-set aside in  accordance with regulation and may miss opportunities to support  improving the local economies of disaster impacted areas by giving  preference in awarding contracts to local vendors to the extent feasible  and practicable, per the Stafford Act. Regulation for Determining  Whether a Vendor Resides or  Primarily Does Business in the  Set-Aside Area Presents  Challenges Despite contracting officers having a high degree of discretion to  determine that an offeror qualifies as a “local firm,”—that is, a firm that  resides or primarily does business in the designated set-aside area— contracting and legal officials at both FEMA and USACE told us they  were unsure what or how much information is sufficient to determine that  an offeror qualifies as a local firm under the FAR.
Interagency Contracting  Coordination Challenges  within the Mission  Assignment Process  Remain As the federal disaster coordinator, FEMA obtains requirements from  states and localities and tasks the appropriate federal agencies, based on  their emergency support function, through the mission assignment  process.
According to  USACE officials, they relied on FEMA, the lead for coordinating  federal disaster response, to manage communication with states and  localities and to identify and manage expectations about the scope of  work to be performed using their debris removal contracts."
812,"As of March 2019, no agency in the federal government was required to  publicly report comprehensive and timely data on political appointees  serving in the executive branch.
According to  Interior’s new Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO), the June 2018  update to Interior’s review process was implemented in response to  deficiencies within its financial disclosure program.
Our review of agency documentation, including SBA’s informal  documentation, found that political appointees completed required initial  ethics training on time.
(Recommendation 3) Agency Comments  and Our Evaluation We provided a draft of this report for comment to the Department of  Justice (DOJ), the White House Counsel’s Office at the Executive Office  of the President (EOP), the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), the Department of the Interior (Interior), the Inspector General of  the Department of the Interior (OIG), the Office of Government Ethics  (OGE), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the Small  Business Administration (SBA).
SBA officials provided  documentation to support that they have taken initial steps to address our  recommendation to implement procedures to track and verify completion  of initial ethics training by political appointees.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology Our objectives were to evaluate the extent to which (1) existing data  identify political appointees serving in the executive branch at any point in  time, and (2) selected agencies use appropriate internal controls to  reasonably ensure that their ethics programs are designed and  implemented to meet statutory and regulatory requirements."
813,"Limited Registration  Verification and Risk  Management Hinder  FAA’s Ability to Prevent  Fraud and Abuse FAA generally accepts certification by applicants of their eligibility and  aircraft ownership and performs limited review of applicant information to  identify potential fraud or abuse.
In our case studies and interviews with FAA, we identified examples of  fraudulent registrations and potential abuse of the registry that occurred  within the context of FAA’s current practice of limited verification and  review of applicant information.
Use of Opaque Ownership  Structures in Aircraft  Registrations Provides  Opportunities for Abuse Individuals or entities may use opaque ownership structures—a legitimate  means to register aircraft—to disguise potential ineligibility or hide illicit  activity, according to our illustrative case and intermediary research, and  interviews with FAA and law-enforcement officials.
Although  the use of opaque ownership structures, intermediaries, and registered  agents can serve legitimate purposes, they can also be abused in the  context of aircraft registration to disguise potential ineligibility or hide illicit  activity, according to our analysis of registry data and research.
According to our review of registry documents for  this case, an intermediary registered the aircraft in 2010 using a  noncitizen trust, providing limited information about the corporate trustor,  whose beneficial owner was a high-net-worth foreign national.
By not collecting and recording PII at the time of application and  renewal, FAA has limited assurance of registrants’ eligibility, and lacks  information that could support its oversight and law-enforcement officials’  ability to identify relevant persons and entities as part of investigations  involving registered aircraft.
By not collecting and  recording information on beneficial owners in an electronic format that  facilitates data analytics, FAA has limited assurance of registrants’  eligibility, and lacks information that could support its oversight and law- enforcement officials’ ability to identify relevant persons and entities as  part of investigations involving registered aircraft.
Additionally, one FAA LEAP agent told us  that he reviews aircraft registrations filed the previous day and checks  them against other information sources to determine suspicious activity,  sharing leads identified through this analysis with law-enforcement  officials for further investigation.
Our intermediary research  identified an aircraft registered to a company whose sole stockholder was  subject to U.S. sanctions; however, FAA currently stores data on foreign  stockholders of U.S. citizen corporations that use voting trusts in PDF  records, preventing it from being able to conduct data analysis to identify  such individuals or entities for all registrations.
According to  2017–2018 analysis of information from declarations of international  operations with checks against flight history data, FAA SEIT identified  patterns of activity that could be used in support of safety and law- enforcement investigations, as discussed later in this report.
To demonstrate how FAA could identify registrations with indicators of  potential fraud or abuse that may enable criminal activity, national  security, and safety risks, we analyzed aircraft registry and related data.
Specifically, we analyzed aircraft registry data from publicly available and  ancillary files, as well as matched registry data against other datasets to  identify (1) registrations using registered agent address, (2) registrations  using opaque ownership structures, (3) aircraft registration addresses  located in countries identified by the Department of State as associated  with major illicit drug production and money laundering, (4) OFAC data on  individuals and entities subject to U.S. sanctions, and (5) NTSB safety  accident and incident reports.
(Recommendation 7) The Administrator of FAA should ensure, as part of aircraft registry IT  modernization, that information currently collected in ancillary files or in  PDF format on (1) owners and related individuals and entities with  potentially significant responsibilities for aircraft ownership (e.g.,  beneficial owners, trustors, trustees, beneficiaries, stockholders,  directors, and managers) and (2) declarations of international operations  is recorded in an electronic format that facilitates data analytics by FAA  and its stakeholders.
(Recommendation 10) The Administrator of FAA should use data collected as part of IT  modernization as well as current data sources to identify and analyze  patterns of activity indicative of fraud or abuse, based on information from  declarations of international operations, postal addresses, sanctions  listings, and other sources, and information on dealers, noncitizen  corporations, and individuals and entities with significant responsibilities  for aircraft ownership."
814,"These  staff are responsible for carrying out the Working Group’s responsibilities,  which include establishing a common understanding and consistent  approach to compliance; creating a means to share information and ideas  to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of section 961 compliance  activities; discussing best practices to streamline procedures and  documentation of internal control testing and reporting; and developing  and updating guidance related to implementing section 961.
(Recommendation 1) The Director of the Division of Corporation Finance should ensure that all  internal supervisory controls include documentation requirements,  detailed procedures, identified follow-up actions, implementation time  frames, and assignment of control execution responsibility, in accordance  with SEC guidance and federal internal control standards for  implementing control activities through documented policies.
(Recommendation 2) The Director of the Division of Enforcement should ensure that all internal  supervisory controls include documentation requirements, detailed  procedures, identified follow-up actions, implementation time frames, and  assignment of control execution responsibility, in accordance with SEC  guidance and federal internal control standards for implementing control  activities through documented policies.
(Recommendation 3) The Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations  should ensure that all internal supervisory controls include documentation  requirements, detailed procedures, identified follow-up actions,  implementation time frames, and assignment of control execution  responsibility, in accordance with SEC guidance and federal internal  control standards for implementing control activities through documented  policies."
815,"FedRAMP Is a  Government-wide  Program for Authorizing  Cloud Services Established by OMB and managed by GSA, the FedRAMP program is  intended to provide a standardized approach to securing systems,  assessing security controls, and continuously monitoring cloud services  used by federal agencies.
The goals of FedRAMP are to: ensure that cloud-based services used by government agencies have  adequate safeguards in place; eliminate the duplication of effort to assess security controls, and  reduce risk management costs; and enable rapid and cost-effective procurement of information  systems/service for federal agencies.
The office’s responsibilities include  managing the program’s day-to-day operations, creating guidance  and templates for agencies and cloud service providers to use for  developing, assessing, authorizing, and continuously monitoring cloud  services per federal requirements (e.g., FISMA).
Selected Agencies Did Not  Consistently Prepare and  Provide Authorization  Letters to the FedRAMP  PMO OMB defines an authorization to operate as an official management  decision where a federal official or officials authorize the operation of  information system(s) and accept the risk to agency operations and  assets, individuals, and other organizations based on the implementation  of security and privacy controls.
To address challenges, GSA has taken steps to  improve the program, but its guidance on FedRAMP’s requirements and  participant’s responsibilities was not always clear and the program’s  process for monitoring the status of security controls over cloud services  was limited.
According to the JAB technical representatives, the FedRAMP  PMO’s program intended improvements include, but are not limited to,  updates to guidance and education resources, plans to automate the  continuous monitoring process with vulnerability scanning tools, and  reduced time and costs associated for completing the authorization  process for both customer agencies and cloud service providers.
(Recommendation 6) The Administrator of GSA should develop guidance requiring that cloud  service authorization letters be provided to the FedRAMP program  management office.
(Recommendation 22) The Administrator of EPA should develop guidance requiring that cloud  service authorization letter be provided to the FedRAMP program  management office.
EPA disagreed with our recommendation that the agency develop  guidance requiring cloud service authorization letters to be provided to  the FedRAMP program management office."
816,"For coal, the royalty rate for surface mining is set at the statutory  minimum set in the Mineral Leasing Act. We previously found that royalty rates for oil and gas leases have not  been adjusted to account for changes in market conditions, and our  preliminary analysis for our ongoing work suggests that adjusting rental  rates for inflation could generate increased federal revenues.
In June 2017, we reported that raising federal royalty rates for onshore  oil, gas, and coal resources could decrease oil and gas production on  federal lands by either a small amount or not at all but could increase  overall federal revenue, according to studies we reviewed and  stakeholders we interviewed.
The two oil and gas studies we reviewed  for that report modeled the effects of different policy scenarios on oil and  gas production on federal lands and estimated that raising the federal  royalty rate could increase net federal revenue from $5 million to $38  million per year."
817,"Screening and Assessments Both of HHS’s congregate and home-delivered meal programs require  states to ensure area agencies on aging or local providers conduct  nutrition screenings and assessments of participants to help identify  health risks.
Nutrition Professionals HHS’s congregate and home-delivered meal programs require the use of  nutrition professionals, such as registered dieticians, to help local  providers meet the nutritional needs of older adults—primarily through menu reviews to verify that each menu is following federal nutrition  requirements, according to HHS officials.
According to the nationwide  evaluation of the congregate and home-delivered meal programs, at least  one-half of the state agencies, area agencies on aging, and local  providers used the services of a nutrition professional to help meet the  nutritional needs of older adults.
Federal Oversight of Meal  Programs Provides  Limited Information on the  Extent to Which Programs  Are Adhering to Nutritional  Requirements and  Addressing Challenges As part of HHS’s oversight of the congregate and home-delivered meal  programs, regional officials meet with state staff and review state plans  and other program information, but these efforts do not require states to  provide documentation that meals served to participants comply with the  programs’ nutrition requirements.
In three of the four selected states, some providers reported partnering  with various entities, including grocery stores, local farmers, and others to  obtain food at low or no cost or serve more older adults, which helped  them to meet the increased demand for the congregate and home- delivered meal programs.
State officials and providers  across the four selected states said that federal guidance on  accommodating the special dietary needs of older adult program  participants is limited and additional support would be helpful."
818,"According to  FEMA, NFIP was designed to address the policy objectives of identifying  flood hazards, offering affordable insurance premiums to encourage  program participation, and promoting community-based floodplain  management.
NFIP also offers Increased Cost  of Compliance coverage for most policies, which provides up to $30,000  to help cover the cost of mitigation measures following a flood loss when  a property is declared to be substantially or repetitively damaged.
FEMA has three  definitions for such properties that vary slightly to meet the specific needs  of different programs: NFIP Repetitive Loss refers to an NFIP-insured structure that has  incurred flood-related damage on two occasions during a 10-year  period, each resulting in at least a $1,000 claim payment.
FEMA  uses the NFIP RL definition for insurance purposes related to the  Community Rating System, for local hazard mitigation plans, and for  eligibility determinations for preferred risk policies and individual  assistance.
HMA grants fund a variety of  methods to mitigate the flood risk of properties, including acquisition,  elevation, relocation, and floodproofing.
Our objectives were to  examine (1) funding programs available for property acquisitions, (2)  FEMA’s flood mitigation efforts, and (3) factors contributing to NFIP’s  fiscal exposure."
819,"NASA officials  also stated that the 6 to 12 months of risk to the launch date accounts for  the possibilities that SLS and Orion testing and final cross-program  integration and testing at Kennedy Space Center may result in further  delays.
Program officials explained that the major  drivers of this cost growth were the slip of the Artemis-1 launch date,  which reflected delays in the delivery of the service module; Orion  contractor underperformance; and NASA-directed scope increase.
However, during our review, Orion program officials originally stated that  this cost estimate assumes an Artemis-2 launch date of September 2022,  which is 7 months earlier than the program’s agency baseline  commitment date of April 2023 that forms the basis for commitments  between NASA, the Congress, and Office of Management and Budget."
820,"In our January 2014 report, we recommended that the Secretary of  Agriculture direct the Administrator of FNS to (1) clarify to states the  importance of documenting compliance issues found during  administrative reviews and requiring corrective actions to address them,  and (2) assess all states’ needs for information to improve their ability to  oversee SFA financial management and provide assistance to meet  identified needs.
Also in that month, an FNS contractor completed a study  intended to provide information to help FNS address our third  recommendation that the agency assess the prevalence of online sales of  WIC formula and identify cost-effective techniques states can use to  monitor and prevent them."
821,"CBP Has Processes  for Inspections at  Land POEs, But Has  Not Updated Related  Policies Consistent  with CBP Guidance CBP’s Inspection  Processes Include  Screening to Identify  Higher-Risk Travelers,  Vehicles and Cargo and  Conducting Physical  Inspections CBP inspects travelers and cargo seeking to enter the country through  land POEs. These inspections involve a targeting process in which CBP  uses law enforcement databases to identify and target higher-risk  passengers, pedestrians, commercial vehicles, and cargo before arrival at  a land POE.
In addition, CBP personnel at the POEs or field offices may review  seizure and arrest reports, and other law enforcement information to  identify individuals or vehicles that have associations with known  criminals and place a “lookout” on them in TECS, CBP’s system for  processing travelers.
While these reports provide useful summary data of CBP’s monitoring of  inspections activities and recommendations for increasing compliance for  some programs and processes, our analysis of SIP results showed that  opportunities exist for CBP to identify potential reoccurring deficiencies at  individual land POEs over time.
In addition to its externally-reported organizational performance  measures, OFO tracks two performance measures internally that relate to  efforts to detect illegal activity among inbound traffic at land POEs: the  percentage of individuals screened against law enforcement databases  for entry into the United States and the land border interception rate for  passengers in privately-owned vehicles with major violations.
OFO has implemented processes and  deployed technology to screen and examine travelers and cargo at POEs;  however, by reviewing and updating its inspection policies in accordance  with its own established time frames, CBP could better ensure that  officers have guidance needed to consistently and properly inspect  passengers, pedestrians, and commercial vehicles."
822,"In addition, in accordance with the MGT Act, the guidance provided  details regarding a Technology Modernization Board, which is to consist  of (1) the Federal CIO; (2) a senior IT official from the General Services  Administration; (3) a member of DHS’s National Protection and Program  Directorate; and (4) four federal employees with technical expertise in IT  development, financial management, cybersecurity and privacy, and  acquisition that were appointed by the Director of OMB.
Our update to the IT acquisitions and operations high-risk area also  stressed that OMB and agencies needed to continue to implement our  prior recommendations in order to improve their ability to effectively and  efficiently invest in IT.
As stated in our 2019 high-risk update, OMB and agencies should  demonstrate government-wide progress by, among other things,  implementing at least 80 percent of our recommendations related to  managing IT acquisitions and operations.
Overall, federal agencies would be better positioned to realize billions in  cost savings and additional management improvements if they address  these recommendations, including those aimed at implementing CIO  responsibilities, reviewing IT acquisitions; improving data center  consolidation; and managing software licenses."
823,"Background Federal Programs that  May Help College Student  Parents Afford Child Care We have previously reported that multiple federal programs provide or  support early learning and child care, but the CCAMPIS program is the  only one designed specifically to support the participation of low-income  parents in postsecondary education by funding child care services.
CCAMPIS Grants  Helped Some Low- Income Students Pay  for Child Care, but  Education Reported  Unreliable Program  Outcome Information CCAMPIS Grants Helped  about 3,300 Students at  85 Schools Pay for Child  Care during the 2016- 2017 School Year CCAMPIS grantees reported that about 3,320 student parents received  subsidized child care services for at least one academic term during the  2016-2017 school year, the most recent year for which performance data  were available.
The persistence rate for students participating in the CCAMPIS program  is the percentage of program participants who receive child care services  that remain in postsecondary education at the end of the academic year,  according to Education’s published definition.
Without either collecting the student enrollment data needed  to calculate a standard 3-year graduation rate or accurately defining and  calculating a different metric, Education is unable to report reliable college  completion results for CCAMPIS participants.
Selected Schools  Generally Did Not Provide  Information on their  Websites as of December  2018 about the Option to  Increase Federal Student  Aid to Help Pay for Child  Care About two-thirds of the college websites we reviewed (40 of 62) did not  include information on their websites about the option to include a  dependent care allowance in financial aid calculations.
Encouragement  from Education for schools to provide information about the dependent  care allowance on their websites could offer student parents more  complete information about the financial aid resources available to them  and how to request additional aid that could ultimately help them remain  in school and graduate.
To assess the extent to which selected schools are publicizing  information about the option to increase federal student aid to help pay for  child care, we reviewed the websites of the 62 schools that first received  a CCAMPIS grant in fiscal year 2017."
824,"FEMA and Red Cross coordinate mass care with the support of other  federal agencies such as USDA, the Department of Health and Human  Services, and the Department of Defense (DOD), as well as voluntary  organizations and partners at the state and local levels.
In addition to co-locating at FEMA’s  National Response Coordination Center in Washington, D.C., FEMA, the  Red Cross, and key mass care partners also co-located in state and local  emergency operations centers (see fig.
Co-location contributed to relationship-building that  facilitated communication and coordination of mass care services,  according to FEMA, Red Cross, and emergency management officials in  all four states we visited.
Pre-existing Relationships  Facilitated Mass Care  Coordination, but Some  Community Groups Were  Not Integrated with  Response Efforts Many FEMA, Red Cross, local government officials, and representatives  from local voluntary organizations we interviewed emphasized the  importance of pre-existing relationships among established partners in  coordinating mass care during the 2017 hurricanes.
During the 2017  hurricane response, officials from unaffiliated organizations such as local  advocacy groups and faith-based organizations told us they experienced  challenges sharing critical information regarding needs, resources, and  capabilities with established mass care organizations.
While many partners coordinated  extensively on the mass care response to 2017 hurricanes, unmet needs  in sheltering, feeding, and supply distribution should spur FEMA and the  Red Cross to consider the sufficiency of current agreements, especially  with state and local governments."
825,"According to the Program Management Plan, for each city, the STC  program consists of three phases that provide for the development,  integration, and sustainment of nuclear or radiological detection capability  by cities to support state, local, and tribal operations.
Specifically, CWMD tracks cities’ spending using program  funds and some performance data through quarterly reports that it  collects from cities, but does not collect other key data to track itemized  expenditures and to assess how effectively cities achieved key  performance metrics and program milestones or how they performed in  exercises or drills that simulate a nuclear or radiological threat.
Specifically, CWMD provides each city eligible for additional funding an  assistance award every year that includes an approved budget for  spending categories such as program staff and equipment, but CWMD  officials told us that CWMD does not track itemized expenditures to  ensure that program funds were spent according to this budget.
The extent of CWMD’s tracking of cities use of STC program funds is not  consistent with federal internal control standards, which state that  program management should design control activities to achieve  objectives, such as comparing actual performance to planned or expected  results and analyzing significant differences.
Although  legacy cities would still receive support under the new version of the  STC program, CWMD officials said that the new program would  provide national coverage and would include detection and deterrence  activities in regions well outside of cities that UASI identified as having  the highest level of threat and risk for a terrorist attack."
826,"TSA Does Not  Consistently Coordinate  with Air Carriers and Other  Industry Stakeholders  When Reviewing  Directives TSA’s Standard Operating Procedures for Security Policy Development,  Coordination, and Issuance requires TSA officials to obtain input from key  stakeholders and representatives of affected regulated parties (e.g., air  carriers), as appropriate, as shown in figure 2.
While TSA’s standard operating procedures state that TSA is to  coordinate with air carriers and other industry stakeholders, the feasibility  of doing so when issuing or updating directives (particularly when the time  frame is short and security measures must reach the industry rapidly due  to a specific threat or recent event) is limited, according to TSA officials.
In addition, according to representatives from one foreign air carrier, had  TSA included them and other foreign air carriers early on in the review  process, the changes to the 2017 emergency amendment pertaining to  international aviation security measures would have been more efficient  and effective.
In addition, TSA’s Standard  Operating Procedures for Security Policy Development, Coordination, and  Issuance requires TSA officials to obtain input from key stakeholders and  representatives of affected regulated parties (e.g., air carriers), when  developing the problem statement, developing options, and drafting the  directive (as appropriate), as discussed above."

828,"According to the U.S. government’s 2018 National  Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, the criminal  activities in the United States that generate the largest share of illicit  proceeds for laundering are fraud, drug trafficking, human smuggling,  human trafficking, organized crime, and government corruption.
It has lead authority  for investigating criminal violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. International Bodies  Involved in Efforts to  Combat TBML Internationally, the U.S. government participates in a number of bodies  that address issues related to TBML, including the Egmont Group, FATF,  UNODC, and the WCO.
In addition, U.S. government reporting, including the 2018 National  Money Laundering Risk Assessment, and U.S. officials noted Chinese  criminal gangs are using TBML schemes to repatriate proceeds from  the sale of synthetic opioids in the United States and around the  globe.
According to information from different U.S. agencies, international  bodies, and partner countries, criminal and terrorist organizations use a  wide variety of goods in TBML schemes, but HSI analysis has found the  most common items are precious metals, automobiles, clothes and  textiles, and electronics (see fig.
In addition, as countries have strengthened their controls to  combat other forms of money laundering, various U.S. government  reports and officials, as well as knowledgeable sources have stated that  there are indications that criminal organizations and terrorist  organizations have increased their use of TBML to launder their funds.
For example: U.S. example: In 2018, FinCEN organized a conference on TBML for  several U.S. agencies involved in combatting TBML, including HSI,  CBP, and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, in addition  to government officials from partner countries and non-government  participants.
According to United Kingdom officials and an international  body report, sharing trade data and relevant financial information, such as  SARs, through an interagency approach is critical because TBML and its  predicate crimes often cut across multiple agencies and their authorities  and responsibilities.
According to the Asia/Pacific Group  on Money Laundering’s APG Typology Report on Trade Based Money  Laundering, governments could coordinate international capacity  building efforts with partner country counterparts, such as sharing  strategies on combatting TBML and emerging trends related to TBML.
In addition to the TTU program, U.S. agencies have established other  methods for sharing information with partners overseas that support  efforts to combat money laundering, including TBML.
While HSI and other U.S. government officials have stated the TTUs in  some countries have played an important role in certain investigations,  the TTU program has faced challenges that limited its results in disrupting  TBML schemes, including:  Insufficient resources or support for the partner TTUs. In recent  years, the U.S. government has not provided any funding directly to  partner TTUs to support their activities, according to HSI officials.
government has worked with these international bodies to develop anti- money laundering standards, share information regarding TBML methods  and specific cases, and provide training and technical assistance to  strengthen the ability of countries to combat TBML.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report examines (1) what the available evidence indicates about the  types and extent of international trade-based money laundering (TBML)  activities, (2) the practices international bodies, selected countries, and  knowledgeable sources have recommended for detecting and combating  TBML, and (3) the extent to which U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement has effectively implemented the TTU program and the steps  the U.S. government has taken to collaborate with international partners  to combat TBML."
829,"According to FirstNet officials, AT&T provides the count of public-safety  agencies at periodic program-review meetings and documents it in a  required contract deliverable.
Specifically, FirstNet lacks: (1) a reliable master schedule  to review, (2) communication with relevant stakeholders regarding  contract oversight, and (3) meaningful information on end-users’  satisfaction to gauge performance quality.
Additionally, the 2012 Act requires FirstNet to consult—via a designated  single point of contact (SPOC) in each state—with regional, state, local,  and tribal jurisdictions regarding a host of activities, such as: ongoing compliance review and monitoring of the management and  operation of the network; practices, procedures, and standards for the management and  operation of the network;  terms of service for use of the network;  radio-access network build out, placement of cell towers, and  coverage areas; and assignment of priority and selection of entities seeking use of the  network.
Officials  wanted additional information on, among other things: contract  requirements, milestones, and progress; technical details on the network  including operational status and location of cell sites; subscribers within  the official’s agency or agencies across the state that had adopted the  network; and FirstNet’s oversight activities and results, including  assurance from FirstNet that network coverage and performance had  been verified.
As FirstNet enters the next  phases of its partnership with AT&T, it could reduce the risks to the  network’s long-term success by strengthening its schedule oversight;  increasing transparency, communication, and reporting of additional  information to states and other public-safety stakeholders; and obtaining  and using meaningful information on the satisfaction of the first  responders for whom the network is intended.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report examines the extent to which (1) AT&T is meeting the  established milestones for deploying the nationwide public-safety  broadband network, including coverage and adoption goals, via its  contract with the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), and (2)  FirstNet is overseeing AT&T’s deployment of the network in accordance  with key practices."
830,"Overall, agency firefighting doctrine emphasizes safety above  all other concerns; Forest Service policy, for example, states, “In  conducting wildland fire suppression, responsible officials shall give first  priority to the safety of firefighters, other personnel, and the public.”  Firefighters and other personnel who respond to wildland fire incidents  are required to complete training to help them identify risks as well as  develop appropriate strategies and tactics to respond to different  situations.
Fire Grew Slowly over  Several Weeks as  Firefighters Pursued  Indirect Strategies (July  14-August 16, 2017) In the second phase of the fire, Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest  officials assigned a type-3 incident management team to manage the  response to the Chetco Bar Fire, following the unsuccessful initial attack.
The Chetco Bar Fire was a relatively low-priority fire during this phase,  since it was far from values at risk and it remained within the Kalmiopsis  Wilderness, while other fires in the region were threatening communities  and resources, according to Forest Service documents and incident  management team officials.
Because firefighters had been unable to suppress the fire during initial  attack, national forest officials said they anticipated, based on knowledge  of previous fires in the area, that the Chetco Bar Fire would become a  long-term incident.
Aggressiveness of  Firefighting Response Some national forest officials and many stakeholders we interviewed said  that the Forest Service was not aggressive enough in fighting the Chetco  Bar Fire before the Chetco Effect winds arrived in mid-August.
National forest and incident management team officials said that in  attempting to suppress the Chetco Bar Fire, they adopted firefighting  strategies and tactics that considered firefighter safety, the values at risk,  and the probability of success.
According to Forest  Service documents and officials, firefighting assets were stretched thin  fighting other fires in the region, and there were a number of times  throughout the Chetco Bar Fire when assets, such as management  teams, crews, and helicopters, were requested but were unavailable (see  table 1)."
831,"The United States and Saudi Arabia first held formal nuclear cooperation  negotiations in 2012, during which the United States provided a draft  agreement text to Saudi officials that included the nine nonproliferation  conditions required under Section 123 of the AEA, according to NNSA  officials.
As  previously stated, section 123 of the AEA requires that the President keep  certain congressional committees “fully and currently informed of any  initiative or negotiations relating to a new or amended agreement for  peaceful nuclear cooperation.” State officials told us during our May 2019 interview that they consistently  provided information to Congress on the nuclear cooperation negotiations  and other interactions with Saudi Arabia.
For example, one  congressional committee staff member told us that agency officials said  they were not obligated to keep the committee currently and fully  informed of negotiations because the United States was not in  negotiations with Saudi Arabia."
832,"MARAD officials identified the following options as having potential to  reduce the costs of operating a U.S.-flag vessel—which would in turn  make U.S.-flag vessels more competitive in the international cargo  market: MARAD is part of a U.S. Registry Working Group looking at a range  of actions to decrease the time and cost of bringing vessels under the  U.S. flag, including the cost of meeting Coast Guard requirements."
833,"During our work for the September 2018  report, SBA officials stated they had completed a risk assessment of the  HUBZone recertification process, but did not provide us with  documentation on when they performed the risk assessment, which risks  were identified and considered, or what analysis established the $1  million threshold."
834,"Without the task force reassessing the approach it used to estimate  savings from the cost of goods sold and, if necessary, making  adjustments to those estimates, decision makers in DOD and Congress  may lack confidence in the reliability of the task force’s savings estimates  in the business case analysis and will not have complete information as  they consider defense resale consolidation.
However, the military departments also provided written  comments that detailed concerns with fundamental aspects of the  business case analysis, to include: the use of proprietary industry  benchmarks; estimated savings, costs, and timeline of the consolidation;  and the proposed governance structure for the new resale organization.
The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the DOD Chief  Management Officer direct the task force to reassess its approach to  estimating savings from cost of goods sold—to include reassessing its  use of the cost of goods sold for all four defense resale organizations  rather than, for example, just for the three exchange organizations—and  make any necessary adjustments to its savings estimates for  consolidation and provide that updated information to Congress."
835,"The responsibilities  include the following, grouped into five broad categories: Administering the application evaluation process for certain Establishing procedures for analyzing and evaluating applications  for these programs, as well as for documenting major decisions in  the application evaluation process through a decision  memorandum or similar mechanism that provides a clear rationale  for such decisions Streamlining the approval processes for the above programs Providing assistance to project sponsors seeking funding or financing Making credit assistance programs more accessible Providing technical assistance, upon request, for proposed public- private partnerships and environmental reviews and permitting,  among other areas Promoting innovative-financing best practices: Developing and monitoring best practices for state authorities and  practices, standard contracts, and analytical tools  Improving environmental reviews and permitting: Serving as DOT’s liaison on the Council on Environmental  Quality Coordinating efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of  the environmental review and permitting process  Identifying, developing, and tracking metrics for permit reviews  and decisions Sharing information on procurement costs and risks: Developing procurement benchmarks for projects receiving  assistance under the above programs, and collecting and  publishing information on procurement benchmarks; to the extent  possible, the benchmarks should establish maximum thresholds  for cost increases and schedule delays, establish uniform ways to  measure these changes, and be tailored to different types of  project procurement Developing guidance to require and publish value for money and  after-action reports findings for public-private partnerships seeking  assistance from the Bureau programs  The conference report accompanying the FAST Act noted that the Bureau  would serve as a one-stop shop for states and local governments, and to  serve in this capacity, the report highlights the Bureau’s role to work with  individual project sponsors as the Bureau administers financing  programs, as well as its broader role to help reduce costs and uncertainty  with environmental reviews and permitting and procurement.
DOT Made Progress  Establishing the  Bureau and Meeting  Some  Responsibilities, but  the Bureau Lacks  Tools to Further  Guide and Measure  Its Efforts DOT established an organizational structure for the Bureau and created a  consolidated process for it to use when working with sponsors to evaluate  applications for financing programs and provide assistance.
As part of its work to develop a structure for the Bureau, DOT’s initial  implementation plan set out guiding principles for what the Bureau aims  to achieve: mobilizing available financial resources for high-impact transportation  projects in the United States;  identifying and encouraging innovative best practices in project  planning, financing, delivery, and monitoring;  clearing roadblocks to provide financing and grants more quickly and  transparently, with a streamlined user interface and less uncertainty,  complexity, and cost for project sponsors; and ensuring the protection of public resources through efficient  leveraging of taxpayer money and the development of a creditworthy  portfolio of projects.
In its initial work, DOT also created a consolidated process for the Bureau  to use when working with project sponsors pursuing TIFIA and RRIF  financing, including standardized steps for evaluating applications for  financing programs as well as providing assistance.
DOT’s work to create this process aligned with two  responsibilities given to the Bureau in the FAST Act: Administering the application evaluation process for certain programs Providing assistance to project sponsors seeking funding or financing  DOT, in creating this process, set out steps that the Bureau would follow  when working with sponsors.
However, for TIFIA and RRIF, selected sponsors had  more mixed experiences and identified challenges with the application  evaluation process, including the length and uncertainty of the process,  changes to requirements or terms, and unclear goals and risk appetite— that is, how much risk an agency is willing to accept to achieve its goals— for the programs.
Bureau officials identified limitations to providing more  certainty to sponsors for each of these challenges and noted that the  Bureau cannot control all the factors, such as a sponsor’s responsiveness  or changes to a project’s proposed financing, surrounding the application  evaluation process.
However,  officials have stated that the Bureau seeks to expand and diversify the  types of projects that access the TIFIA and RRIF programs, and one of  the Bureau’s own guiding principles is to clear roadblocks to provide  financing more quickly and transparently and to have a consistent  application process.
To assess the Bureau’s process for evaluating applications and providing  technical assistance, we reviewed the Credit Programs Guide and other  Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials to determine the  phases and steps in the process."
836,"Seven of the eight participating agencies’  websites direct public users back to Regulations.gov and the Federal  Register, either on webpages that are about the public comment process  in general, or on pages containing information about specific NPRMs."
837,"(See table 2.) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs considers the  health care budget estimate developed by VHA when assessing resource  requirements among competing interests within VA, and OMB considers  overall resource needs and competing priorities of other agencies when  deciding the level of funding requested for VA’s health care services.
Separate from VA’s health care appropriation accounts, the Veterans  Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 provided $10 billion in  funding for the Choice Program, which was implemented in early fiscal  year 2015 and authorized until funds were exhausted or through August  7, 2017, whichever occurred first.
VA estimated that from fiscal years 2019 through 2021, obligations for  community care will increase to $17.8 billion, which VA officials said are  attributable to the new eligibility criteria under the VA MISSION Act. The  authority for the Choice Program ends June 6, 2019, after which the new  Veterans Community Care Program—which consolidates VA’s  community care programs under the VA MISSION Act—will be expected  to begin.
Prior to this fiscal year 2017 budget request, VA  developed a single budget estimate of the resources needed to provide  all VA health care services, regardless of whether these services were  purchased from community providers or delivered in VA medical facilities,  because all these services were to be funded through the same  appropriation account.
Appendix II: Budget Formulation Process for  the State Home Per Diem Program and Non- Veteran Community Care Programs The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and its actuarial consultant use  the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model to develop most of the  department’s estimate of the resources needed to meet the expected  demand for VA’s health care services."
838,"DSCA officials said the new accounting system,  when fully implemented, is expected to allow both DSCA and DIILS to  track funds according to the specific recipient country and Section 333  security assistance program, which would better enable DOD and others  to effectively monitor the status of funds dedicated to these efforts.
DOD officials said that they planned to develop  additional guidance to meet the mandated M&E requirements for  security assistance, which includes human rights training.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense,  should develop a plan with a clear timeline for monitoring and evaluating  the effectiveness of human rights training for foreign security forces  provided under IMET.
We  interviewed DOD and State officials about their current and planned  actions to monitor and evaluate human rights training as well as  examples of M&E-related efforts for security assistance programs that  include human rights training."
839,"FEMA and  Communities Lack  Access to Some Data  That Would Be Useful  in Overseeing and  Implementing Post- Flood Requirements NFIP Communities Assess  Damage to Properties  Following a Flood,  Sometimes with FEMA  Assistance Immediately after a flood, local floodplain management officials may  assess the extent of damage to individual properties and determine  whether damage is substantial enough that certain structures must be  rebuilt to current NFIP requirements.
While FEMA may provide assistance in conducting damage  assessments, NFIP guidance documents state that community floodplain  management officials are responsible for estimating the cost to repair and  the market value of the structure, determining which properties are  substantially damaged, and notifying property owners of their  determination.
FEMA  regional officials also said that following Hurricane Irma, FEMA floodplain  management specialists helped train local officials for, or assisted local  communities in conducting, 20,206 substantial damage assessments in  Florida.
New staff guidance, which officials said will be  implemented sometime in 2020, explicitly outlines for NFIP floodplain  managers and FEMA staff the information NFIP communities should  collect and maintain when performing substantial damage  assessments."
840,"In conducting these  reviews, Corporation Finance staff may provide comments to a company  to obtain additional information, clarification on the company’s disclosure,  or to significantly enhance its compliance with applicable reporting  requirements.
Most Large Investors  Told Us They Sought  Additional ESG  Disclosures to Better  Understand and  Compare Companies’  Risks  Most Investors Said They  Engage with Companies  to Address Gaps or  Inconsistencies in ESG  Disclosures That Limit  Their Usefulness Institutional investors with whom we spoke generally agreed that ESG  issues can have a substantial effect on a company’s long-term financial  performance.
Most Companies  Disclosed on Many ESG  Topics, but Detail Varied  on How ESG-Related  Risks Are Managed To assess the amount and characteristics of the ESG information  companies report, we reviewed regulatory filings and voluntary reports  issued by 32 large and mid-size public companies in eight industries.
As discussed earlier, some investors with whom we spoke said they seek  additional narrative disclosures from companies whose disclosures  contained generic language or did not provide specific details about how  the company manages ESG-related risks or opportunities.
While this guidance does  not include specific instructions for reviewing ESG disclosures, staff are  instructed to conduct background research on companies and industries  to determine if there is material information, such as potential risks, that  may be relevant to a company’s filing.
Overall, Corporation Finance staff found that most  sampled companies included disclosure of selected ESG topics within 10- K filings and told us they did not issue additional guidance or interpretive  releases on these topics following these assessments.
For example, while new ESG-related requirements may help  achieve greater comparability in ESG disclosures across companies and  reduce investor demands on public companies, voluntary approaches  may provide more flexibility to companies while limiting potential costs  associated with disclosing ESG information that may not be relevant for  their business."
841,"Specifically, Systems Operation  Control Section officials maintain guidelines detailing parameters for shift  length and rest periods when scheduling air marshals to fly missions.
However, Medical Programs Section officials told us their assessment  was not derived from an analysis of air marshals’ medical data but rather  relied on anecdotal information gathered from on-call nurses fielding calls  from sick air marshals and providing routine occupational health case  management.
FAMS Has Taken  Steps to Address  Schedule  Unpredictability, but  Has Not Monitored  Work Hours against  Guidelines or Made  Them Available to  Employees FAMS Has Taken Steps to  Reduce Schedule  Unpredictability Resulting  from Its New Concept of  Operations Air marshals in each of the six field offices we visited stated that schedule  unpredictability—short-notice changes to their start times, missions, and  at-home days—was a key quality of life issue.
According to Flight Operations Division officials, FAMS typically staffed  SMCs using air marshals scheduled to domestic and international  missions, recovery shifts, or ground-based duties prior to the  implementation of the standby shift.
According to Flight Operations  Division officials, field office SACs reported that FAMS frequently  adjusted air marshals’ scheduled start times for the single standby shift in  response to SMC requests.
However, air marshals in each of  these four field offices stated that Mission Operations Center personnel  do not always observe air marshals’ scheduled standby shift hours.
Without monitoring the extent to  which air marshals’ shifts and rest periods are consistent with scheduling  guidelines, FAMS management is not well positioned to determine if  scheduling guidelines are serving their purpose to balance air marshals’  quality of life with FAMS’s operational needs to execute its mission, nor  can it determine the extent to which air marshals are working beyond the  guidelines.
To identify steps FAMS has taken to address air marshals’ concerns  about their schedules, we interviewed management officials from FAMS’s  Flight Operations Division about their efforts to (1) monitor air marshals’  shifts and rest against scheduling guidelines and (2) make scheduling  protocols available to staff."
842,"We categorized these  recommendations into nine areas: (1) veterans’ access to timely health  care; (2) veterans’ community care program; (3) human capital  management; (4) information technology; (5) appeals reform for disability  benefits; (6) quality of care and patient safety; (7) national policy  documents; (8) contracting policies and practices; and (9) veterans’  access to burial options.
Overall Rating for the  Managing Risks and  Improving VA Health  Care High-Risk Area  Remained  Unchanged in 2019 Since we designated VA health care as a high-risk area in 2015, VA has  begun to address each of the identified five areas of concern related to  managing risks and improving VA health care: (1) ambiguous policies and  inconsistent processes; (2) inadequate oversight and accountability; (3) IT  challenges; (4) inadequate training for VA staff; and (5) unclear resource  needs and allocation priorities.
In June 2017, VA also  identified the following as enterprise-wide root causes of its high-risk  designation: disjointed strategic planning; poorly defined roles, responsibilities, and decision authorities; poor horizontal and vertical integration;  lack of reliable data and analysis;  ineffective human capital management; and  inadequate change management.
VA has not fully implemented our priority recommendation calling  for the department to define the role of the Interagency Program  Office in the governance plans for acquisition of the department’s  new electronic health record system.
We have identified challenges in the following areas of concern related to  VA’s acquisition management: (1) outdated acquisition regulations and  policies; (2) lack of an effective medical supplies procurement strategy;  (3) inadequate acquisition training; (4) contracting officer workload  challenges; (5) lack of reliable data systems; (6) limited contract oversight  and incomplete contract file documentation; and (7) leadership instability.
However, as we reported in March  2018, VA’s appeals plan does not provide reasonable assurance that  it will have the capacity to implement the new process and manage  risks.
We made two recommendations to improve VA’s disability benefit  appeals process, including that VA (1) clearly articulate in its appeals  plan how it will monitor and assess the new appeals process  compared to the legacy process, and (2) ensure that its appeals plan  more fully addresses related risks, given the uncertainties associated  with implementing a new process."
843,"Experts stated that the availability of mid-band  spectrum to carriers in the United States is not yet sufficient to meet  carriers’ needs for 5G network deployment because of existing  congestion within the band.
However, experts told us that, as currently allocated, mid-band spectrum  is highly congested, leading to an insufficient amount available for carriers  to deploy 5G networks in the United States.
Other activities,  according to FCC, include: (1) opening a proceeding in the 3.1 to 3.55  GHz band to consider potential shared use between federal operations  and flexible use commercial services; and (2) authorizing a private entity  to deploy a low-power terrestrial nationwide network in certain  frequencies that will make available additional spectrum for advanced  wireless services, including 5G.
Within urban settings, experts said  that high-band 5G networks are more likely to be deployed in  commercially viable areas, including those parts of a city that already are  equipped with fiber and power and, presumably, already benefit from the  most advanced mobile broadband services available.
Additionally, the 5G FAST Plan identifies a number of current and future  strategies for FCC but does not include specific performance goals or  measures that would allow it to understand what those strategies are  intended to achieve and the effects those strategies are having on the  digital divide as 5G networks are deployed."
844,"In 2015, we reported that because of ongoing problems hampering the  progress of the pretreatment facility at Hanford, EM was pursuing other  pretreatment alternatives (such as feeding the waste from the tanks  directly to the vitrification facilities) but had not properly defined the  mission need for the analysis or developed a reliable life-cycle cost  estimate for the alternatives being analyzed.
According to these officials, they  cannot complete a cost estimate for the pretreatment facility until EM has  made a decision about the future of the facility and, if necessary, BNI  develops design changes to address technical challenges.
According to July 2019 correspondence between EM and BNI, both  parties consider these technical challenges to be resolved, and according  to ORP officials, pretreatment facility engineering and design followed by  its construction may now continue.
For example, in its June 2014 plan for  addressing the challenges, BNI noted that prior to making a decision to  proceed with construction of the facility, it would need to conduct a  number of additional steps, including updating the designs of the  pretreatment facility and assessing the nuclear safety basis and the  contract implications for the updated designs.
According to EM officials, resolving the technical challenges  likely will require BNI to change its designs for the pretreatment facility  and conduct significant rework in portions of the facility that have been  completed.
We reported in May 2015  that in analyzing alternative LAW pretreatment approaches, EM did not  meet two key steps outlined in best practices and DOE internal  guidance—define mission need and develop a life-cycle cost estimate for  its alternatives.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following two recommendations to DOE: The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of  Environmental Management to ensure that EM’s final AOA for HLW  pretreatment at the Hanford Site includes a definition of mission need  and life-cycle cost estimates for the baseline or status quo alternative,  as called for in the best practices for an AOA process we have  identified and DOE guidance."
845,"In addition to analyzing workforce data, in each of the fiscal years 2014  through 2017, DHS utilized the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) and DHS’s employee exit  survey results to help identify and address barriers.
While Investigating Various  EEO Anomalies, DHS  Identified Three Barriers Subsequent to its trigger identification and department-wide barrier  analysis, from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, DHS identified three  barriers: (1) problems with supervision/management, lack of  advancement opportunities, lack of alternate work schedules, insufficient  work/life programs, and personal/family related reasons causing higher- than-expected nonretirement separations for white females and several  ethnic and racial groups; (2) the geographic location of jobs which has  contributed to the low hiring rates of racial groups in certain major  occupations; and (3) medical and physical requirements of law  enforcement positons, such as the ability to engage in moderate to  arduous physical exertion, which limit the eligibility of some applicants  with targeted disabilities.
Our review of DHS’s MD-715 reports from fiscal years 2014 through 2017  also shows that DHS has planned activities and targeted completion  dates to address each identified barrier, and each trigger for a potential  barrier.
Although FLETC, Secret Service, and USCIS did not identify EEO  barriers in fiscal year 2017, they each developed action plans that  identified activities designed to help address and correct undesired  conditions, identified responsible officials, and set time frames for  addressing the conditions.
CRCL officials told us that DHS and its components’ MD-715 reports met  EEOC requirements for action plans for fiscal years 2014 through 2017  by providing explanations for, or briefly stating plans to address, the  majority of their deficiencies rather than developing action plans  identifying how each deficiency would be addressed.
Developing  policies or procedures, in consultation with the Deputy Officer for EEO  and Diversity, to help ensure component EEO programs have action  plans with measurable objectives for addressing deficiencies could help  DHS components better comply with EEOC requirements."
846,"DOE orders also require that nuclear facility maintenance plans address  aging degradation and obsolescence and that surveillance inspections be  conducted to detect malfunction and deterioration and determine whether  the structural integrity of contaminated excess facilities is threatened.
Due to elevated risk of contamination and radiation exposure  to inspectors, subsequent structural integrity assessments were  completed using existing information from prior evaluations, including  testing of tunnel structural material, instead of collecting updated  information through physical inspections to determine if the PUREX  tunnels were structurally sound for continued use, according to RL  officials.
In addition, although recommended in EM’s 2017 Extent of  Condition Review, to date, RL has not taken action to direct the cleanup  contractor to carry out comprehensive inspections at all contaminated  excess facilities, and there are areas of some facilities that still have not  been entered, either physically or by remote means, to conduct internal  inspections.
EM’s Field Operations Oversight/Chief of Nuclear Safety Office and  DOE’s Office of Enterprise Assessments are required to conduct  independent oversight to the extent necessary to evaluate the  effectiveness of DOE field office oversight of contractor activities,  including activities needed to maintain contaminated excess facilities in a  safe and compliant condition pending their final cleanup.
(Recommendation 1) The Assistant Secretary of DOE’s Office of Environmental Management,  while ensuring the protection of DOE workers, the public, and the  environment, should ensure that RL directs the Hanford Site cleanup  contractor to explore using robotic or other means to routinely complete  comprehensive surveillance inspections of contaminated excess facilities  to identify aging degradation and obsolescence of facilities and take  timely action as warranted."
847,"Upcoming Initial  Operational Test and  Evaluation Will  Demonstrate Extent  to Which Technical  Issues Have Been  Addressed as  Program Approaches  End of Development The program has made progress addressing technical risks and  performance challenges we discussed in prior reports and deficiencies  confirmed during the April 2019 operational assessment.
Program Schedule Has  Slipped Further but  Remains within the  Original Approved  Schedule Thresholds Initial operational testing of the VH-92A, which will be used to evaluate  operational effectiveness and suitability of the helicopter, training system,  support equipment, upgraded MCS software and other changes  implemented to address previously identified issues, is now scheduled to  be conducted between June and September 2020."
848,"Factors that affected the  electricity grid restoration efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands included logistical constraints, availability of materials, the  financial condition of local utilities, and the unprecedented and extensive  role of federal agencies.
This includes $2 billion that FEMA  obligated for direct federal assistance through mission assignments to  USACE for temporary emergency power and grid restoration efforts in  Puerto Rico.
DOE received  mission assignments from FEMA and deployed staff from its  headquarters, site offices, and power marketing administrations to  provide subject matter expertise and technical assistance in support of  electricity grid damage assessments and power restoration efforts in both  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."
849,"However,  challenges with planning to manage change; limited guidance and  methods for analyzing capabilities; and lack of clarity about decision- making processes, roles, and responsibilities while adapting to a new  enterprise-wide approach could limit the success of the Strategy’s  implementation."
850,"We also stressed that  the Bureau needed to rigorously test census-taking activities; ensure that  scheduling adheres to best practices; improve its ability to manage,  develop, and secure its IT systems; and have better oversight and control  over its cost estimation process.
The 2020 Census  Remains High Risk  Due to Challenges  Facing the  Enumeration The 2020 Census is on our list of high-risk programs because, among  other things, (1) innovations never before used in prior enumerations are  not expected to be fully tested, (2) the Bureau continues to face  challenges in implementing IT systems, (3) the Bureau faces significant  cybersecurity risks to its systems and data, and (4) the Bureau’s cost  estimate for the 2020 Census was unreliable.
We made seven recommendations to improve the Bureau’s management  of risks to the 2020 Census, including that the Bureau develop mitigation  and contingency plans for all risks that require them, establish a clear  time frame for plan development, and ensure that the plans have the  information needed to manage the risk.
According to the Bureau’s risk management framework, the systems  expected to be used to conduct the 2020 Census will need to have  complete security documentation (such as system security plans) and an  approved authorization to operate prior to their use.
Specifically, the Bureau  is working with DHS to ensure a scalable and secure network connection  for the 2020 Census respondents (e.g., virtual Trusted Internet  Connection with the cloud), improve its cybersecurity posture (e.g., risk  management processes and procedures), and strengthen its response to  potential cyber threats (e.g., federal cyber incident coordination).
Continued  Management  Attention Needed to  Keep Preparations on  Track and Help  Ensure a Cost- Effective Enumeration  2020 Challenges Are  Symptomatic of Deeper  Long-Term Organizational  Issues The difficulties facing the Bureau’s preparation for the decennial census  in such areas as planning and testing; managing and overseeing IT  programs, systems, and contractors supporting the enumeration;  developing reliable cost estimates; prioritizing decisions; managing  schedules; and other challenges, are symptomatic of deeper  organizational issues."
851,"For example: The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agency chief information  officers (CIO) to annually (1) assess the requirements established for  agency personnel regarding knowledge and skills in information  resource management and the adequacy of such requirements for  facilitating the achievement of performance goals; (2) assess the  extent to which the positions and personnel at executive and  management levels meet those requirements; (3) develop strategies  and specific plans for hiring, training, and professional development to  address any deficiencies; and (4) report to the head of the agency on  the progress made in improving information resources management  capability.
The  framework identifies four workforce planning steps and supporting  activities that address (1) setting the strategic direction for IT workforce  planning, (2) analyzing the IT workforce to identify competency and  staffing gaps, (3) developing and implementing strategies to address the  gaps, and (4) monitoring and reporting progress in addressing the gaps.
Specifically, our high-risk update in February 2013 noted that  OPM and agencies would need to use a strategic approach that (1)  involves top management, employees, and other stakeholders; (2)  identifies the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to  achieve current and future programmatic results; (3) develops strategies  that are tailored to address skill gaps; (4) builds the internal capability  needed to address administrative, training, and other requirements  important to support workforce planning strategies; and (5) includes plans  to monitor and evaluate progress toward closing skill gaps and meeting  other human capital goals using a variety of appropriate metrics.
We reported that, until the agencies fully implemented key  workforce planning activities, they would have a limited ability to  assess and address gaps in knowledge and skills that are critical to  the success of major IT acquisitions.
Specifically,  three agencies had fully implemented the activity (Defense, VA, and  SSA); 20 agencies had partially implemented the activity by periodically  assessing IT staffing needs; however, these agencies did not  periodically assess competency needs (Agriculture, Commerce,  Education, Energy, HHS, DHS, HUD, Interior, Justice, Labor, State,  Transportation, Treasury, GSA, NASA, NSF, NRC, OPM, SBA, and  USAID); and one agency did not implement the activity (EPA).
Specifically,  two agencies had fully implemented the activity (VA and SSA); nine agencies had substantially implemented the activity (Agriculture,  Defense, DHS, HUD, State, Transportation, GSA, NASA, and SBA); 12 agencies had partially implemented the activity by periodically  assessing IT staffing gaps, but not periodically assessing competency  gaps (Commerce, Education, Energy, HHS, Interior, Justice, Labor,  Treasury, NSF, NRC, OPM, and USAID); and one agency had minimally implemented the activity (EPA).
Specifically,  two agencies had substantially implemented this activity (Defense and  VA),  seven agencies had partially implemented the activity (HHS, DHS,  State, Treasury, SBA, SSA, and USAID), and 15 agencies had minimally implemented the activity by implementing  workforce efforts identified in FITARA, but not implementing strategies  and plans to address its identified competency and staffing gaps  primarily because they had not developed strategies and plans to  address identified gaps (Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy,  HUD, Interior, Justice, Labor, Transportation, EPA, GSA, NASA, NSF,  NRC, and OPM).
In addition, the agency described its planned efforts to fully implement   the remaining IT workforce planning activities, including developing an IT  workforce planning process and monitoring and reporting on progress in  addressing competency and staffing gaps."
852,"We aggregated  data from individual DOD organizations and estimate that at least 8,000  military, civilian, contractor, and FFRDC personnel were working on  space acquisitions in multiple locations across the United States at the  end of 2017.
Size of Workforce: Based on data we collected from multiple DOD  space acquisition organizations, at least 8,000 military, civilian,  contractor, and FFRDC personnel supported DOD’s space acquisitions  as of December 31, 2017 (see figure 2).
Workforce Mix: Based on data we collected from multiple DOD space  acquisition organizations, the mix of military, civilian, contractor, and  FFRDC personnel that each military service and agency had supporting  their respective space acquisition programs varied considerably (see  figure 3).
Air Force  Space and Missile Systems Center officials said they are trying to help  the government engineers understand how to influence decisions and be  more effective in working as part of the space engineering acquisition  team, which would include military, civilian, contractor, and FFRDC  personnel.
They stated that DOD has  separate mechanisms for collecting military, civilian, contractor, and  FFRDC workforce data and that none of these systems contained the  level of granularity we would need to identify all personnel working on  space acquisitions."
853,"We analyzed initial review times using a statistical regression with  two variables reflecting key features of the NDAs—target time frame for  review of the application under FDA’s PDUFA goals (in days, from FDA’s  receipt of the NDA to FDA’s targeted date for completion of the initial  review) and number of expedited programs (0, 1, or 2 or more)—along  with division as independent variables.
These key features included: whether the NDA had a priority review designation (a designation  applied by FDA if the product would provide a significant therapeutic  improvement in the safety and effectiveness of the prevention,  diagnosis, or treatment of a serious condition when compared to  available drugs) or instead had a standard designation; whether the NDA did or did not involve a new molecular entity—an  active ingredient that had not previously been marketed or approved  for use as a drug in the United States, whether the NDA did or did not involve a major amendment (a  submission, while a pending NDA is under FDA review, of additional  information that may include a major new clinical safety or efficacy  study report or major new analyses of studies, among other things);  and whether the NDA did or did not qualify for an expedited program  (accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation, or fast track  designation), programs intended to help reduce the time involved in  developing or reviewing certain drugs that have the potential to treat  serious or life-threatening conditions.
To determine the extent to which key NDA features contributed to  differences between divisions in the time taken to complete initial reviews,  we conducted a multiple regression analysis of the number of days FDA  took to complete its initial review with division as an independent variable,  along with two other independent variables to control for the key NDA  features: Target time frame for initial review of the NDA under FDA’s  PDUFA goals."
854,"During public health emergencies, CDC may  operate an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for monitoring and  coordinating its response to emergencies—including infectious disease  outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, and pandemic influenza—in the United States  and abroad.
In the  cases of Zika, Ebola, and pandemic influenza, CDC and ASPR are two  key agencies that conduct federal infectious disease modeling efforts.
According to a CDC internal report, the most frequent uses of infectious  disease modeling at CDC are: guiding preparedness and response efforts;  conducting economic analyses to evaluate the benefits of public  health actions, thereby reducing illness and deaths from infectious  diseases; understanding pathogen biology, disease transmission, and  estimating disease burden; and assessing the effect of interventions and prevention strategies.
ASPR modelers and officials said models have provided information  about topics such as:  resources, including protective equipment, needed to help respond to  an Ebola outbreak;  the number of therapeutics and vaccine doses needed to respond to  Ebola, both in Africa and domestically; expected U.S. demand for Zika diagnostics; and  the number of vaccine doses needed to mitigate the spread of  pandemic influenza.
CDC and ASPR have modeled to answer  a variety of public health questions relevant to Ebola, Zika, and pandemic  influenza, and, at times, the results helped inform policy and planning  decisions.
The extent of modeling conducted for Ebola, Zika, and pandemic  influenza varied according to the question being asked, along with other  factors as follows: Type of question: CDC and ASPR have used models to answer  such questions as who should be prioritized for vaccination or  treatment, how transmissible a disease is, and how effective certain  interventions are likely to be, according to modelers and agency  officials.
For example, CDC  modelers and officials said the agency’s Division of Vector-Borne  Diseases has focused its resources in other areas, such as building  the capacity of states to address vector-borne diseases, and therefore  had not invested in individuals with the right skill sets to conduct  modeling for the Zika outbreak response.
During the 2014-2016 Ebola and 2015-2016 Zika outbreaks, the Department of  Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Preparedness and Response (ASPR) established temporary modeling  coordination groups that brought together government agencies and academics to  share early modeling results and discuss pressing questions that could be  answered through modeling, according to ASPR modelers and officials.
According to  a publication describing the model, policymakers have used it to  evaluate responses to the risk for arrival of Ebola-infected travelers,  and it can be used in future infectious disease outbreaks of  international origin to plan for persons requiring treatment within the  United States.
Selected Examples of Memoranda of Understanding for Coordinating on Infectious Disease Modeling  Collaborating agencies   The Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness  and Response (ASPR) and  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) ASPR and the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) Description  From 2013 to 2018, CDC and ASPR had a memorandum of understanding to promote collaboration,  provide expertise, and facilitate data and information exchange related to infectious disease modeling.
By holding  similar progress reviews in which CDC and ASPR evaluate and report on  coordination efforts for infectious disease modeling, these agencies could  be better positioned to identify and address challenges prior to infectious  disease outbreaks occurring, which could lead to improved responses.
Modelers Faced  Several Challenges  and Have Worked to  Address Them Based on our review of documents and reports from agencies, as well as  expert and agency interviews, we identified three categories of challenges  that CDC modelers and officials and ASPR modelers faced when  modeling for Ebola, Zika, and pandemic influenza, along with steps they  took to address the challenges.
There is limited manpower during an infectious  disease outbreak response, which can limit the health care system’s  ability to collect data, according to CDC modelers and officials  responding to Ebola and ASPR modelers.
To be selected for inclusion in our non- generalizable sample, the model had to be (1) developed by CDC, or  ASPR officials or contractors; (2) developed to answer a question about  Ebola, Zika, or pandemic influenza; and (3) used to inform public health  decision makers during an outbreak or for preparedness activities.
Because we selected from a group of  models identified by HHS modelers and officials for Ebola, Zika, and  pandemic influenza, the results of our review cannot be generalized to  other diseases outside of the scope of this report.

855,"However, as table 2 also shows, the majority of foreign-sourced USG  procurement, in terms of both value and number of contracts, went to  firms located in countries that are not among the other six main parties to  the GPA and NAFTA.
For example, the aggregate  value of contracts awarded by the USG for goods and services originating  in countries of the other six main parties was about 43 percent of the  overall value of USG foreign source procurement—the same proportion  we found when using firm location as proxy measure of foreign sourcing.
Most of the databases we analyzed  contain fields on contract award value and type of contract, as well as  fields on firm location or country of product or service origin—proxy  measures of foreign sourcing that, as we have found, allow for broad  cross-country comparisons.
As figure 3 shows, using the United States for illustrative  purposes, foreign versus domestic sourcing in government procurement  could be viewed in four different ways —firm location, firm ownership,  product and service origin, and place of contract performance.
The central governments of the EU, Mexico, and the United  States awarded less than 5 percent of the aggregate value of their  procurement contracts to foreign-located firms.
Given the goals promoted  by the GPA and NAFTA, one might expect that procurement covered by  such agreements would likely result in a higher number or larger  aggregate value of contracts awarded to foreign-located firms or for the  purchase of foreign goods and services.
The available data from the government procurement databases that we  analyzed show that the USG and the central governments of Mexico and  South Korea awarded at least twice as much to foreign sources for  contracts covered by international agreements—ranging from 2 to 6  percent of the value of covered contracts compared with less than 1 to 2  percent for non-covered contracts (see table 4).
Finally, with regard to the number of contracts awarded, our analysis of  available data from country databases does not show a consistent  relationship with international procurement agreement covered awards to  foreign-located firms or for foreign-sourced goods or services.
Such comparisons include the amount of foreign  sourcing, measured using firm location and country of product and  service origin, by the USG and central governments of the other six main  parties to the GPA and NAFTA."
856,"Moreover, the Air Force does not track the overall progress being made  from its accession and retention efforts to maintain a sufficient quantity of  RPA pilots and sensor operators needed to implement as planned its  combat-to-dwell policy—a policy intended to better balance RPA units’  time in combat operations with time spent away from those operations to  accomplish other activities such as training.
More specifically, the number of RPA pilot and sensor  operator requirements has increased every year in support of the Air  Force’s plan to create a new wing by 2024 that is needed to implement  the combat-to-dwell policy.
Headquarters Air Force officials stated that in order to  meet this 2024 goal, the Air Force is working to increase the number of  trained RPA pilots and sensor operators through its accession, training,  and retention efforts because they said it cannot implement the combat- to-dwell policy if it lacks sufficient quantities of available personnel.
However, the Air Force does not know its overall progress toward  achieving its goal of having sufficient quantities of RPA pilots and sensor  operators to implement the combat-to-dwell policy in fiscal year 2024 as  planned.
Without using quality information, the Air  Force does not fully know the number of active-duty RPA pilot and sensor  operator instructor positions necessary for sufficiently training RPA  aircrews.
He stated that when RPA pilots and sensor operators at  squadrons leave the Air Force that means there are fewer of them overall  available to conduct the missions and to be sent to the formal training unit  to serve as instructors.
According to Air Force  officials, examples of initiatives completed include: expanding RPA combat operations to Shaw Air Force Base, South  Carolina, to provide additional assignment options; establishing an advanced weapons instructor course specifically for  redesignating MQ-9 Reaper RPA squadrons from “Reconnaissance”  to “Attack;” establishing a medal to specifically recognize the contributions of  personnel that operate and support the RPA enterprise; and, authorizing RPA aircrews to log combat time when flying an aircraft  within designated hostile airspace, regardless of the aircrew’s physical  locations.
The Secretary of the Air Force should ensure that a comprehensive  metric (or set of metrics) is established to track the progress of its  combined accession and retention efforts to obtain sufficient quantities of  RPA pilots and sensor operators needed to achieve its objective of  implementing the combat-to-dwell policy as planned."
857,"T-Band Relocation  Poses Significant  Challenges, Including  Uncertainty of  Available Spectrum,  High Cost, and  Interoperability  Concerns  Lack of Available  Alternative Spectrum in  Major Metropolitan Areas Public safety officials in three of our four selected metropolitan areas— Boston, Los Angeles, and New York City—told us that they have not been  able to identify alternative spectrum to relocate from the T-Band, a  situation that raises questions about the feasibility of the auction and  relocation.
Public  safety officials from Boston, Los Angeles, and New York City metropolitan  areas also said that FCC has not provided a plan or identified alternative  spectrum for relocation.
Officials from nearly all of the public safety entities we interviewed in the  Boston and New York City metropolitan areas cited the NPSTC reports as  the best source of publicly available cost calculations for relocating public  safety users from the T-Band.
According to public safety users in the Boston, Los Angeles, and New  York City metropolitan areas, costs for relocating LMR systems from the  T-Band depend on a variety of factors including (1) equipment, (2)  infrastructure, and (3) real estate."
858,"If the prospective contractor reports having unpaid federal taxes under  this provision, the contracting officer must  request additional information from the prospective contractor;  in accordance with agency procedures, notify the officials responsible  for debarment and suspension actions, commonly referred to as the  suspension and debarment officials (SDO); and not award to the corporation unless an agency SDO has considered  suspension or debarment of the corporation and has made a  determination that suspension or debarment is not necessary to  protect the interests of the government.
For example, the Department of  Defense, DOE, HHS, and VA issued class deviations as early as 2012  that required contracting officers to take two actions: (1) insert an  alternate provision when issuing solicitations using appropriated funds  and (2) obtain an SDO determination that suspension or debarment is  not necessary to protect the interests of the government before  awarding a contract to a contractor who reported qualifying tax  debts.
Specifically, according to our analysis of FPDS-NG and  SAM data for this period, the five selected agencies potentially should  have notified an SDO prior to awarding 1,849 contracts to contractors that  reported having qualifying federal tax debt under their § 52.209-11  representation or § 52.209-5 certification, which we discuss further  below.
As a result, these contracts  may have been awarded without required actions being taken—a  potential violation of federal regulations and, in some cases, the  Antideficiency Act. In addition, we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of seven contracts  where prospective contractors reported qualifying tax debts before  receiving contract awards and identified two illustrative examples where  agency control activities did not ensure regulatory compliance.
As  mentioned earlier, when prospective contractors report having qualifying  federal tax debt under § 52.209-11, the FAR requires that contracting  officers (1) request that the contractor provide such additional information  as the contractor deems necessary in order to demonstrate responsibility;  (2) notify, in accordance with agency procedures, the SDO of the  contractor’s reported qualifying federal tax debt, before award, for  suspension and debarment review; and (3) not award the contract unless  an SDO determines that further action is not required to protect the  interest of the government."
859,"OPM and Agencies  Need to Strengthen  Efforts to Identify and  Close Mission-Critical  Skills Gaps The federal government faces long-standing challenges in strategically  managing its workforce.
Although Congress, OPM, and individual agencies have made  improvements since 2001, federal human capital management remains a  high-risk area because mission-critical skills gaps within the federal  workforce pose a high risk to the nation."
860,"As an example, in fiscal year 2019, OHE officials told  us it provided funds to the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative, VA’s  Center for Health Equity, Research, and Promotion, and two VISNs. In  addition to OHE-funded research, VA’s Health Services Research &  Development (HSR&D) has spent about $12 million to fund research  studies related to identifying and reducing disparities in health care  outcomes between minority and other veterans since 2014.
These officials told us  that they are currently developing two health equity dashboards that will  use VA’s data on race and ethnicity to provide information on health care  outcomes, which would allow VA staff to identify any disparities in these  outcomes at the VISN and VA medical center levels.
Further, weaknesses in  race and ethnicity data due to problems with the completeness and  accuracy continue to limit VA’s ability to identify and address disparities in  health care outcomes at the VA medical center level."
861,"Based on our analysis of the Division’s data and discussions with the  jurisdictions, the Library, House, and Senate jurisdictions were the  primary users of the Division during fiscal years 2014 through 2018,  comprising more than 90 percent of the total work by cost for completed  projects, as shown in figure 4.
As another example, jurisdiction officials also  told us that using a contractor requires that AOC develop full design  specifications for a project, a process that takes time and resources.
As discussed above, because the Division  does not receive an appropriation for the salaries and expenses of its  temporary construction support employees, it pays for those costs by  charging the jurisdictions for direct labor hours and also an “indirect  rate.” Division officials told us that payroll responsibility for some  construction support positions could be transferred to PPM and that  this transfer would reduce the Division’s indirect rate because that  rate increases by about 1.1 percent for each employee captured in the  rate.
Division officials told us that 5 to 6 months prior to March 2017, they  anticipated a potential decline in the Division’s workload and worked with  the jurisdictions to identify potential projects that the Division could  execute, but sufficient additional projects did not materialize.
AOC may renew the employment of temporary employees at the end of  their 13-month appointment based on project needs and the availability of  funding, according to human capital officials."
862,"Additionally, federal contractors  and subcontractors are generally required to take affirmative action to  ensure that all applicants and employees are treated without regard to  race, sex, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, and gender  identity, and to employ or advance in employment qualified individuals  with disabilities and qualified covered veterans.
Under Executive Order 11246 and  other federal laws and regulations, covered federal contractors and  subcontractors are prohibited from discriminating in employment on the  basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or  national origin and are required to take affirmative action to help ensure  that all applicants and employees are treated without regard to these  factors.
The  agency has taken action to fully implement three of our  recommendations: (1) to address the risk geographic imbalances in  compliance evaluation assignments; (2) to review outreach and  compliance assistance efforts and identify options for improving  information provided to federal contractors; and (3) assess existing  contractor guidance for clarity."
863,"Provider Screening and  Enrollment Requirements To limit payments to ineligible providers—such as those convicted of  program-related fraud and abuse, or with a suspended or revoked  medical license for reasons of bearing on professional competence or  performance—federal regulations require states to screen and enroll all  providers, whether the provider furnished, ordered, or referred services to  an eligible beneficiary or whether the service was paid for under FFS or  Medicaid managed care contracts.
CMS conducts these off-site reviews on specific  aspects of states’ program integrity activities, such as a state’s  progress toward implementing corrective action plans in response to  PERM findings and payments made to providers terminated from  Medicaid.
For example, officials from one state told us they  spent $5.9 million from 2015 through 2018 to develop a new provider  screening and enrollment system that included an online provider  application portal and automated screening activities, such as  conducting database checks and flagging high-risk providers for site  visits and fingerprint-based background checks.
CMS also  conducts several oversight activities—the PERM, focused program  integrity reviews, and other activities—to oversee states’ compliance with  provider screening and enrollment requirements."
864,"Data on Tax  Compliance for Virtual  Currencies Are  Limited  Tax and Information  Returns Do Not  Specifically Capture  Information on Virtual  Currency Income and  Transactions IRS has limited data on tax compliance for virtual currency use, partly  because the forms taxpayers use to report their taxable income do not  require them to identify whether the source of their income is from virtual  currency use.
According to IRS officials  responsible for examining tax returns, IRS’s focus is on ensuring  taxpayers are reporting all of their taxable income and it is not necessary  to distinguish between virtual currency transactions and other property  transactions being reported.
For tax years 2013 to 2015, IRS  searched electronically filed Forms 8949 to identify how often  taxpayers included language in the property description to indicate the  transaction likely involved bitcoin, the most widely traded virtual  currency at the time.
The official told us that if IRS were to  develop additional virtual currency guidance in the future, it may focus on  a different audience, such as taxpayers involved in virtual currency  businesses or exchanges that could be subject to third-party information  reporting.
According to our review of websites for nine major U.S.-based virtual  currency exchanges, as of November 2019, two exchanges have policies  posted online stating that they report information for some of their  customers’ virtual currency transactions to IRS on Form 1099-K.
To report virtual currency income accurately under IRS  guidance, taxpayers need to report information about each transaction,  including cost basis and fair market value at the time virtual currency is  disposed of, such as by selling it for cash or another virtual currency on  an exchange.
FinCEN officials stated that FinCEN and IRS  had issued a statement on IRS’s website in 2014 informing the public that  virtual currencies did not need to be reported on the FBAR."
865,"According to DHA officials, in a typical  transition, DMDC requires 3 to 4 days to make adjustments to  beneficiaries’ records in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting  System, including assigning beneficiaries to incoming contractors and  regions for the T-2017 contracts.
However,  DHA did not address the issue until December 12, 2017, at which  point DHA rejected the incoming contractor’s request for additional  historical data because the outgoing contractor would not have  enough time to provide it by the start of health care delivery on  January 1, 2018.
Some of DHA’s  Requirements for  Determining Contractors’  Readiness for Health Care  Delivery Were Not  Feasible or Effective DHA experienced challenges executing its new T-2017 transition  oversight methods—PRV/PRAV and performance guarantees—as  planned because of fundamental problems with how some requirements  were written and the implementation of TRICARE Select."
866,"To secure passenger rail, TSA  primarily partners with public and private transportation operators to  address their security needs by conducting vulnerability assessments and  sharing intelligence information and key practices, among other  measures.
In addition to engaging with domestic passenger rail stakeholders, TSA’s  Office of Policy, Plans, and Engagement is responsible for coordinating  domestic and international multimodal transportation security polices,  programs, directives, strategies, and initiatives, including conducting  outreach to foreign stakeholders.
TSA Actively Works  with Domestic  Stakeholders to  Identify Standards  and Key Practices but  Provides Limited  Guidance on Foreign  Stakeholder  Engagement  TSA Works with  Stakeholder Groups to  Develop Domestic  Standards and  Recommended Practices TSA participates in APTA working groups that review and develop  standards and recommended practices for passenger rail security,  including those that apply to intermodal station security and  cybersecurity.
Officials from another agency  noted that they participate in international information sharing surveys  and research to learn about cybersecurity practices by foreign rail  operators, and sent representatives to an international mass transit  training forum on the development of threat, vulnerability, and risk  assessments.
Specifically, to address recommendation  1, TSA plans to draft an Operational Implementation Plan, which will  provide guidance to TSARs for engaging with foreign surface  transportation stakeholders, including in passenger rail security."
867,"Further, federal agencies  have struggled with appropriately planning and budgeting for modernizing  legacy systems; upgrading underlying infrastructure; and investing in high  quality, lower cost service delivery technology.
Table 1 provides a generalized list of each of the 10 most critical legacy  systems that we identified, as well as agency-reported system attributes,  including the system’s age, hardware’s age, system criticality, and  security risk.
According to our review of government and industry best  practices for the modernization of federal IT, agencies should have  documented modernization plans for legacy systems that, at a minimum,  include three key elements: (1) milestones to complete the modernization,  (2) a description of the work necessary to modernize the legacy system,  and (3) details regarding the disposition of the legacy system.
For instance, DHS’s Federal Emergency Management Agency’s  modernization plan for its selected legacy system described the work that  the department needed to accomplish, but did not include the associated  milestones or the disposition of the legacy system.
The five agencies attributed the success of their modernization initiatives  to various factors, including: using automated technologies to examine programming code and  perform testing (DOD and Treasury);  testing the system thoroughly (SSA and Treasury); actively engaging the end users and stakeholders throughout the  modernization process (SSA and Treasury);  cultivating a partnership between industry and government (DOD);  following management practices on change and life cycle  management (Education); developing and implementing an enterprise-wide cost collection and  data analysis process for commodity IT to track and measure  progress against consolidation, optimization, and savings targets  (DHS);  creating an interface that was consistent across systems (SSA); having strong executive leadership and support (Treasury); and using agile principles to facilitate the team’s ownership of the project  (Treasury).
Recommendations for  Executive Action In the LOUO report that we are issuing concurrently with this report, we  are making a total of eight recommendations to eight federal agencies to  identify and document modernization plans for their respective legacy  systems, including milestones, a description of the work necessary, and  details on the disposition of the legacy system.
In written comments from HHS on the LOUO version of this report, the  agency stated that it concurred with the recommendation and intends  to evaluate ways to provide its modernization plan, including  milestones and a description of the work necessary to modernize the  system.
The LOUO report includes eight recommendations that we made to eight  agencies to document modernization plans for particular legacy systems,  including milestones, a description of the work necessary, and details on  the disposition of the legacy system."
868,"In addition, we identified opportunities to increase the climate resilience  impact of federal funding options based on our review of our past work,  related reports, an international standard, and the Louisiana and  Canadian examples, as well as interviews with stakeholders: Using both existing and new funding options."
869,"Further, the law requires that,  among other things, the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations  to ensure that adequate processes and controls are in place to provide for  the accurate accounting of logistic support, supplies, and services  received or provided under ACSAs. The legislation also instituted a new  congressional notification requirement that DOD may not enter into an  ACSA without notifying the appropriate congressional committees of its  intent to do so at least 30 days in advance.
State’s Office of the Assistant Legal Advisor’s Office of  Treaty Affairs is responsible for receiving texts of signed international  agreements from the agencies that signed them, for recordkeeping  associated with such agreements, and for transmitting the texts of such  agreements to Congress in accordance with the Case-Zablocki Act. As of February 2020, records for the 118 ACSAs that had entered into  force indicate that State’s notifications to Congress for 68 (or 58 percent)  were dated within 60 days, as required.
DOD Has Received  Reimbursement for an  Estimated 64 Percent of  Recorded ACSA Orders  from October 2013  through March 2018, but  Thousands of Orders  Identified as Overdue  Remain Unreimbursed Section 2344(a) of Title 10 of the United States Code provides that the  United States can use ACSAs to transfer logistic support, supplies, and  services to partners in return for cash reimbursement or by replacement- in-kind or exchange of supplies or services of an equal value.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology Senate Report 115-262, accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019, includes a provision for us  to review several aspects of Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement  (ACSA) management, including information provided to Congress and  Department of Defense (DOD) tracking of support and receipt of  reimbursement.
To determine the extent to which agencies have provided information to  Congress about ACSAs, we analyzed agency activities related to (1)  DOD’s requirement to notify Congress of its intent to designate a country  eligible for an ACSA and (2) State’s requirement to notify Congress no  later than 60 days after the entry into force of international agreements,  which includes ACSAs. First we reviewed DOD’s congressional notification requirements under  10 U.S.C.
On the basis of (1) reporting from the DOD Inspector  General, (2) interviews with DOD officials, (3) DOD’s use of manual entry  to populate the system, and (4) our review of DOD’s use of ACSA orders  to process reimbursement for unpaid transactions with members of the  Saudi-led Coalition, we determined that DOD’s data in AGATRS may not  be fully reliable."
870,"Specifically, southwest border  USAOs filed about 91,000 improper entry, illegal reentry, and alien  smuggling cases in fiscal year 2018, compared to a prior four-year high of  about 78,000 immigration-related cases filed in 2014.
Further, the total number of  cases filed with a lead charge of improper entry, illegal reentry, or alien  smuggling increased between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 in the  five southwest border districts, consistent with the priorities in the April  2017 and April 2018 memoranda, although the magnitude of the  increases varied.
Figure 4 illustrates the number of cases filed by  USAOs with a lead charge of improper entry, illegal reentry, or alien  smuggling along the southwest border, as well as trends in such cases  from fiscal years 2014 through 2018.
DOJ data indicate that the total number of cases filed  with a lead charge of improper entry in southwest border districts more  than doubled between fiscal year 2017 and 2018, as illustrated in table 5.
For instance, the New  Mexico USAO removed a monthly limitation originally enacted in fiscal  year 2016 on the number of illegal reentry cases filed they would accept  following the April 2017 memorandum, according to Border Patrol and  USAO officials.
Officials from USAOs, USMS, Border Patrol, federal courts,  and federal defenders along the southwest border told us that they are  using more personnel, physical space, or both to support increased  immigration-related prosecutions than they were prior to DOJ’s  prioritization of immigration enforcement in April 2017.
USMS officials we spoke with in all five southwest border districts  said that they reassigned deputies in fiscal year 2018 from proactive task  forces (such as task forces dedicated to arresting individuals with active  federal warrants) to judicial security court duty and detention security to  support increased immigration-related prosecutions.
Additionally, we determined that improper entry, illegal reentry,  and alien smuggling charges comprised approximately 99 percent of  immigration-related cases filed on the southwest border from fiscal years  2014 through 2018."
871,"IRS data for 2008–2016 and information from industry  participants and a consumer advocacy group’s reports suggest that  trends in the market for tax-time financial products include the decline of  refund anticipation loans and that refund transfers became the most used  product.
Tax-Time Financial  Products Have Evolved  Since 2012 Despite limitations with IRS data on product use by tax year, our analysis  of multiyear trends from these data, supplemented with data collected by  the National Consumer Law Center and from Securities and Exchange  Commission filings, suggests that use of refund anticipation loans  declined, the refund advance was introduced while refund transfers have  become the most used tax-time product.
According to fee  information we were given during our undercover visits, paid tax  preparers generally charged their customers $39.95 or $49.95 during the  2018 tax filing season for a refund transfer that sometimes included both  federal and state tax refunds.
Income-Related  Characteristics Lower-income households were more likely to use tax-time financial  products than higher-income households, particularly when they used  paid tax preparers to file their taxes, according to our analysis of 2017  FDIC data.
Our analysis of FDIC data further suggests that other characteristics  associated with use of tax-time financial products include age and  household type.
According to our analysis of  IRS data from 2016, tax-time financial product users were more likely  than other taxpayers to receive their tax refunds by direct deposit.
Tax Preparation Fees Not Paid  Out of Pocket Lower-income taxpayers also use tax-time financial products to defer  payment of fees related to tax return preparation, according to federal  government and industry reports that we reviewed.
Instead of using tax-time financial products to defer payment of tax  preparation fees, lower-income taxpayers can access free filing services  through several IRS programs (see sidebar).
Providers We  Reviewed Generally  Disclosed Required  Information but Some  Disclosure Practices  May Hinder  Consumer Decision- Making The federal banking regulators oversee banks that offer tax-time financial  products and IRS sets standards of practice for certain service providers  (including some tax preparers).
Bank documents were more likely than information provided by paid  preparers (in person or online) to include more disclosures about the  fees and terms of tax-time financial products.
To supplement the IRS data, we  collected information from reports issued by the National Consumer Law  Center, reviewed Securities and Exchange Commission filings for two  selected tax preparers, and interviewed representatives from National  Consumer Law Center and both tax preparers on the offerings of tax-time  financial products.
Based on  our interviews and other research reports, refund anticipation  loans and other tax-time financial products (including refund  anticipation checks) may be used by consumers to get their tax  return faster than IRS could provide it."
872,"Based on our  analysis of FCC, FTC, and DOJ enforcement cases and alerts from  federal and state government agencies, as well as interviews with  stakeholders, we identified three types of caller ID spoofing schemes.
Nonetheless, FCC, FTC, and  DOJ officials told us they use this complaint data to identify specific  trends in types of scams that may help the agencies’ enforcement and  public education efforts, which we discuss later in this report.
Agencies Consider  Risk of Harm to  Public and Generally  Follow Key  Collaboration  Practices in Their  Enforcement Efforts,  but Face Significant  Challenges  Agencies Reported Taking  Risk-Based Approach to  Prioritizing Spoofing- Related Investigations and  Enforcement Actions, but  Collecting Evidence Can  Be Difficult FCC, FTC, and DOJ officials all said that their agencies must prioritize  which illegal spoofing activity to investigate and take enforcement action  against because they do not have sufficient resources to pursue all such  activities.
FTC and FCC  officials stated that in addition, their collaboration with DOJ is enhanced  through the participation of all three agencies in a monthly conference call  hosted by the National Association of Attorneys General to coordinate  efforts to combat illegal robocalls across the government.
Although DOJ officials told us that DOJ does not have a memorandum of  understanding with FCC or FTC regarding spoofing or robocall-related  enforcement, officials we interviewed at all three agencies identified  collaborative efforts that DOJ engages in that are consistent with the  three key practices cited above."
873,"According to CMS officials, the most  comprehensive source of information on coverage for behavioral health  services is contained in the publication Medicare & Your Mental Health  Benefits, which is also available at Medicare.gov.
According to CMS officials, the agency also uses other strategies for  providing information to beneficiaries about coverage of behavioral health  benefits."
874,"The Nuclear Deterrent Senior Oversight Group―co- chaired by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear  Matters, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and  Missile Defense Policy, the Joint Staff Deputy Director for Strategic  Stability, and a senior-level representative of the Director of CAPE―also  receives annual briefings on DOD components’ assessments of their  progress, reviews organizational changes, and discusses other issues  related to the management, operations, and health of the nuclear  enterprise—including human resources and culture, operational  availability, sustainment, and modernization and recapitalization issues  not directly addressed in other forums.
In December  2016, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum that  directed the transition of the tracking and analysis responsibilities related  to implementing the recommendations of the 2014 nuclear enterprise  reviews from CAPE to the military departments and other DOD  components.
According to DOD officials,  DOD is in the process of implementing these recommendations, with the  intent of having the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command and the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment provide  leadership with respect to NC3 capabilities, while the Executive  Management Board maintains its role for those systems that primarily  relate to non-NC3 systems, with all three entities reporting on their  respective issues to the NLC3S Council.
DOD conducts sustainment and maintenance on nuclear enterprise  weapon systems to ensure that these systems are available to support  current military operations and maintain the capability to meet future  requirements.
For example, existing outcome metrics can aid in the  assessment of whether completed actions have addressed underlying  issues that affect the health of the enterprise, identified risks can aid the  department in addressing issues as they arise, and the use of the tools  themselves can help maintain visibility across the DOD nuclear  enterprise, including aiding the communication of timely information to  senior leaders.
According to DOD officials, as these nuclear weapon systems have aged  they have required more maintenance in order to sustain them through  their extended service lives, and they will continue to do so until they are  replaced by new systems.
For example, according to  Air Force officials, the B-2 is experiencing challenges related to  maintaining aircraft availability during the extensive modernizations that  are being conducted, including integration of a new weapon and  upgrades to its radar system.
According to Defense Logistics Agency officials, they also have  a series of new initiatives to increase materiel availability and accomplish  activities such as paying for the cost of reverse engineering to fill in voids  that exist in technical data for nuclear enterprise systems; working in  additive manufacturing to set the standard for 3D printing and polymers  across DOD and subsequently printing parts on demand; and identifying  weaknesses in the industrial base and focusing investments in those  areas.
According to Navy officials, the Navy Nuclear  Deterrent Mission Oversight Council addresses long-term issues affecting  the Navy’s nuclear enterprise and identifies and monitors risks associated  with those issues, including the actions taken in response to sustainment  and maintenance-related recommendations from the 2014 nuclear  enterprise reviews.
According to Air Force officials, they have  also identified challenges associated with scheduling maintenance  activities, including the need to balance longer working days with the  additional risks that maintainers face as a result of these longer days."
875,"CDER requests that FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) inspect  both domestic and foreign establishments to ensure that drugs are  produced in conformance with applicable laws of the United States,  including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations.
At the time of our December testimony, FDA  officials told us that the agency was trying to fill vacancies in each of  these groups, but the lower staff numbers may limit FDA’s ability to  conduct more foreign inspections.
Work for our December 2019 testimony indicated  that language barriers—which we first reported as a challenge to  conducting foreign inspections in our 2008 report—can add time to  inspections and raise questions about the accuracy of information FDA  investigators collect and thus about the equivalence to domestic  inspections.
In contrast, FDA officials told  us that inspections conducted by in-country investigators in China or  India, and domestic inspections in the United States, are generally  scheduled one at a time and can thus more easily be extended if the  investigator needs additional time to pursue potential deficiencies."
876,"Two-Generation  Approaches to Poverty  Reduction Two-generation approaches are different from individual low-income  programs because these approaches simultaneously address multiple  areas, such as child and family economic supports, education,  employment, health, well-being, and social capital, according to HHS.
Federal officials have reported that the 10 programs have  characteristics—including the target populations, purposes, and services  provided—that allow state and local entities to address multiple aspects  of child and parent well-being, and these have implications for their two- generation approaches.
To create their unique two-generation poverty reduction approaches and  address the needs of their communities, selected entities reported the  significance of involving leadership, changing policies, expanding  services, modifying service delivery practices, and/or serving specific  populations."
877,"OIT officials told us that they planned to use available 2016 Census data  to determine the top 10 states for the fiscal year 2018 award cycle and  then, after receiving applications, determine award amounts that would  comply with this requirement.
At the end of each  grant period, OIT officials told us they review the information collected  through the quarterly reporting to determine whether the state met the  total match requirement based on the amount of federal dollars  expended.
OIT officials stated in July 2018 that, as a result of our review,  they planned to implement a new quarterly process to focus on match  information specifically, which would ensure documentation of whether a  state meets its total match requirement before the grant is closed at the  end of each fiscal year program cycle.
SBA Made Changes  to Enhance STEP in  Response to States’  Feedback, but Some  States Reported  Ongoing Challenges  to Using Grant Funds According to agency officials, OIT made some changes to the program in  response to feedback from states, including addressing some types of  challenges that states say affect their ability to use all their grant funds.
SBA Made Changes in  Response to States’  Feedback OIT officials told us that they made some changes to STEP for the fiscal  year 2017 program cycle in response to informal feedback from states,  including changes to address concerns about use of funds and the  administrative burden of the application.
We developed a nongeneralizable sample  of the 12 states that did not use 25 percent or more of their grant funds in  fiscal year 2015, and interviewed officials from those states in order to  gain insight into their experiences with the program, including the  challenges that they faced using the full award amount."
878,"We found that SRQA met  these leading practices through our interviews with knowledgeable officials who discussed the Bureau’s strategy for managing fraud risk for  the 2020 Census, and our review of documentation such as the fraud risk  assessment, which listed roles and responsibilities for staff from the  divisions in the antifraud group and the technical integration contractor.
The Bureau Designed a  Response Plan and  Collaborated Internally to  Mitigate Fraud Risks but  Did Not Include Plans to  Refer Potential Fraud to  the Office of Inspector  General The design and implement component of the Fraud Risk Framework calls  for federal managers to design and implement a strategy with specific  control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks and collaborate to help  ensure effective implementation.
This includes determining risk  responses and documenting an antifraud strategy; designing and  implementing specific control activities; developing a plan outlining how  the program will respond to identified instances of fraud; and establishing  collaborative relationships and creating incentives to help ensure effective  implementation of the antifraud strategy.
(Recommendation  1) The Secretary of Commerce should ensure that the Director of the  Census Bureau updates the Bureau’s decennial risk management plan to  include clear time frames for developing and obtaining management  approval of mitigation and contingency plans.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of Commerce should ensure that the Director of the  Census Bureau updates the Bureau’s decennial risk management plan to  require that portfolio and program risk registers include a clear indication  of the status of mitigation plans.
(Recommendation 3) The Secretary of Commerce should ensure that the Director of the  Census Bureau updates the Bureau’s decennial risk management plan to  require that risk mitigation and contingency plans, including the risk  register descriptions and separate plans, have the seven key attributes  for helping to ensure they contain the information needed to manage risk."
879,"For budget decisions for federal programs  with fiscal exposure to climate change, we found in the April 2018 report  that information that could help provide a more complete understanding  would include: (1) costs to repair, replace, and improve the weather- related resilience of federally-funded property and resources; (2) costs for  federal flood and crop insurance programs; and (3) costs for disaster  assistance programs, among other identified areas of fiscal exposure to  climate change."
880,"Furthermore, according to FCC’s strategic  plan, FCC must ensure its USF programs, including those for the high- cost program, are well managed, efficient, and fiscally responsible, and  the National Broadband Plan says that FCC should move rate-of-return  carriers to incentive-based regulation mechanisms, such as model-based  support.
Yet because a substantial number of rate-of-return study areas— 437—continue to receive traditional cost-accounting support, and the  carriers that provide service in these areas cannot be effectively audited,  significant fraud risks remain for the high-cost program.
(Recommendation 2) The Chairman of FCC should design and implement an antifraud  strategy for the high-cost program with specific control activities,  based upon the results of fraud-risk assessments and a  corresponding fraud risk profile, as provided in GAO’s fraud risk  framework."
881,"CDER requests  that FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) inspect both domestic and  foreign establishments to ensure that drugs are produced in conformance  with applicable laws of the United States, including current good  manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations.
In our 2010 and  2016 reports we found that FDA had taken steps to improve the accuracy  and completeness of information in its catalog of drug establishments  subject to inspection, such as using contractors to conduct site visits to  verify the existence of registered foreign establishments and confirm that  they manufacture the products that are recorded in U.S. import records.
FDA officials attributed this decrease to vacancies in the number of  investigators available to conduct inspections (which we discuss later in  this testimony statement) and to inaccurate data used to select  establishments for inspection in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.
In contrast, FDA officials told us that  inspections conducted by in-country investigators in China or India, and  domestic inspections in the United States, are generally scheduled one at  a time and can thus more easily be extended if the investigator needs  additional time to pursue potential deficiencies."
882,"Kentucky: In July 2017, Kentucky submitted  changes to its pending application for a new  demonstration, including: replacing a provision for a year-long  phase-in of a proposed 20-hour per week  work and community engagement  requirement for beneficiaries with a 3- month phase-in of the requirement; and   disenrolled for 6 months for failing to  timely report changes in income or other  circumstances affecting eligibility.
In line with  our recommendation, CMS has since developed an enhanced set of  STCs that specify when evaluation reports are due, and reported in  November 2018 that it is in the process of developing protocols to  ensure that these requirements are consistently included in the STCs. CMS Applies Limited  Transparency  Requirements in  Approving States’  Amendments to  Existing  Demonstrations Transparency Requirements for  Amendments   Applications for amendments to Medicaid  section 1115 demonstrations are subject to  requirements for seeking public input outlined  in guidance the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) issued in 1994 and  those included in the special terms and  conditions governing each demonstration.
For example, one state amended  its demonstration to cover dental services for adults with disabilities, while  other amendments included such changes as requiring beneficiaries to  work or participate in community engagement activities as a condition of  maintaining Medicaid eligibility, as was done through amendments in  Arkansas and New Hampshire during the period we reviewed.
Regarding evaluations, the extent to which CMS considered concerns  raised through public comments for the four demonstration approvals was  also not always clear, including how input informed the evaluation  requirements in the STCs. For example, commenters on the applications  submitted by Indiana and Kentucky raised concerns about aspects of the  work and community engagement requirements proposed by each state,  such as the requirements for reporting work or other activities and the  circumstances under which beneficiaries would lose coverage."
883,"OSD’s and the Military  Departments’ Six  Assessments Identifying  Installations at Risk of  Water Scarcity OSD-level entities and the three military departments conducted six  assessments between April 2017 and January 2019 that, despite having  varied focus areas, all included at least one component focused on  vulnerability to water scarcity.
An OSD official told us that the OSD assessments  constitute the best DOD information available on installations at risk of  water scarcity, but we found that the assessments do not align with  leading practices for identifying and analyzing water scarcity—practices  that contribute to a reliable assessment of water availability.
In contrast,  we found that the military department assessments do align with these  leading practices, but OSD officials disagree as to whether these  assessments can and should be used to identify installations at risk of  water scarcity across the defense enterprise.
OSD Officials Disagree on  What Information They  Should Use for Identifying  Installations at Risk of  Water Scarcity As noted earlier in this report, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment is responsible for water management at all  military installations."
884,"Generally, each  agency’s civil rights or diversity office conducts Title IX compliance  reviews, develops policies and procedures for grantees, and investigates  allegations and complaints involving university researchers supported by  their agency’s federal STEM grants.
While formal Title IX  complaint investigations are agency-led, investigations of sex  discrimination concerns, including sexual harassment, filed with HHS-NIH  are university-led, with HHS-NIH assessing the university grantee’s  response to the allegation to ensure appropriate action is taken to ensure  a safe research environment (see appendix II for more details).
By publicly communicating to  individuals that they may notify the agency of a concern of sex  discrimination outside of the formal Title IX complaint process, NASA,  USDA, DOE, and HHS-OCR could receive additional information  necessary for appropriate Title IX oversight.
There  are no formal procedures within HHS for communicating information  across the agency components regarding Title IX complaints, concerns of  sex discrimination including sexual harassment, or Title IX compliance,  according to officials from both HHS-NIH and the HHS-OCR.
For example, as we noted  above, HHS-NIH launched a website to receive concerns of sex  discrimination including sexual harassment, and NSF and NASA have  modified grant terms and conditions that require universities to report  findings of sexual harassment.
(Recommendation 10) The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  should direct the Director for the Office for Civil Rights and the  Director of NIH to develop and implement formal procedures for  sharing relevant information about Title IX (compliance reviews,  violations, and complaints) and sex discrimination concerns, including  sexual harassment.
(Recommendation 13) The Administrator of NASA should establish goals and an overall plan  to assess all of the agency’s sexual harassment prevention efforts for  their university grantees, including methods to regularly monitor and  evaluate its sexual harassment prevention policies and  communication mechanisms (e.g. Title IX or sex discrimination  websites).
(Recommendation 14) The Director of NSF should establish goals and an overall plan to  assess all of the agency’s sexual harassment prevention efforts for  their university grantees, including methods to regularly monitor and  evaluate its sexual harassment prevention policies and  communication mechanisms (e.g. Title IX or sex discrimination  websites)."
885,"Our work has shown that the Army has improved  ground force readiness in recent years; however, the Army has also  identified capability shortcomings in its weapon systems and platforms  that have yet to be addressed through its modernization efforts.
Additionally, as we found since our 2016 report was published, the Army  has added or plans to add capacity, including converting two infantry  brigades into armored brigades and activating two new Mobile Short  Range Air Defense battalions by fiscal year 2022, to better prepare the  force for large-scale combat against major adversaries.
In addition to challenges in meeting authorized end strength, our past and  ongoing work indicates that the Army faces challenges in filling and  maintaining key skills in a number of areas, and in managing the time  Army personnel spend away from their home station.
The Army Has Made  Progress  Implementing Its  Training Priorities and  Addressing Past  Issues, but Faces  Some Implementation  Challenges Our prior work has shown that the Army has made progress in preparing  the force for large-scale combat operations by increasing training  exercises and reducing mandatory training requirements."
886,"To help ensure that agencies’ services are fully transitioned to EIS before  the current contracts expire, GSA issued guidance that identified several  critical milestones that agencies should meet.
According to GSA, agencies’ responsibilities under  EIS include, among other things:  identifying key personnel, chiefly a Senior Transition Sponsor, Lead  Transition Manager, and Transition Ordering Contracting Officer; engaging expertise from Chief Information Officers, Chief Acquisition  Officers, and Chief Financial Officers to build an integrated transition  team of telecommunications managers, acquisition experts, and  financial staff; analyzing and confirming the accuracy of the inventory of active  services that must be transitioned; developing a transition plan that describes technological goals, a  transition schedule that includes GSA’s major transition milestones  (e.g., releasing all fair opportunity solicitations by March 31, 2019, and  issuing all task orders by September 30, 2019), strategy for issuing  task orders on EIS, and any constraints or risks; preparing solicitations for task orders; placing task and service orders; and  reviewing, accepting or rejecting, and paying for services.
All of the selected agencies reported that they plan to fully transition their  telecommunications services to EIS before the current contracts are set  to expire in May 2023.
Officials from the 11 agencies that did not plan to finish their transitions to  EIS by GSA’s September 30, 2022, milestone reported that they planned  to complete the transitions before the current telecommunications  contracts are set to expire in May 2023."
887,"Multiple Aspects of  the REAC Inspection  Program Have  Weaknesses Our March 2019 report identified a number of areas in which HUD needs  to improve its physical inspection process and its oversight of inspectors,  which could help better ensure the health and safety of households that  live in HUD-assisted properties.
These areas include conducting a  comprehensive review of the inspection process; incorporating sampling  error as part of determining inspection frequency and enforcement  actions; tracking whether inspections are conducted by their expected  date; enhancing the process and practices related to selecting, training,  and evaluating inspectors; and ensuring that new quality control policies  and procedures are implemented.
As of November 2019, HUD officials told us the agency  had taken steps to implement the recommendation, including requiring  PHAs to submit appropriate documentation regarding public housing  units’ compliance with lead paint regulations and updating an internal  checklist for on-site compliance reviews that HUD staff conduct."
888,"Foreign nationals seeking E-2 status must  provide evidence and supporting documentation to State’s consular  officers or USCIS’s immigration officers showing that they and their  related business meet these requirements.
See appendix III for  additional State and USCIS data on the characteristics of foreign  nationals seeking E-2 status, including annual statistics, the relatively low  number of E-2 nonimmigrants who remain in the United States beyond  the conclusion of their authorized period of stay (i.e., overstay), and other  post-adjudication outcomes.
According to State officials, refusal rates may be higher for investors  because such applicants are typically the first in their company applying  for an E-2 visa; if denied, then future E-2 applicants (e.g., manager or  essential employee) would need to wait until such investor is approved or  find another individual or business investor to form the basis for their E-2  employment status.
On the basis of our review of  a generalizable sample of petitions of E-2 principals (i.e., investors,  managers, and essential employees), we estimate that one third of  principal beneficiaries had been in the United States since 2014 or earlier  at the time they sought to change to or extend E-2 status in 2018, some  as long as 18 years, as shown in figure 11.
For example, a State consular officer at one post we visited  told us that he requested such assistance for an application from an  investor whose company had a particularly complex ownership structure  that made it difficult to determine if at least 50 percent of the company  was owned by nationals of a treaty country.
State Officials Identified  Challenges and Training  Needed for Adjudicating E-2  Visa Applications Consular officers we spoke with noted that E-2 visa adjudications are  particularly complicated and resource-intensive, involving potentially  complex business issues, and often requiring more documentation and  time to adjudicate than is typically needed to adjudicate other visas.
For  example, LES at one post we visited stated that additional training and  resources that clarify the eligibility standards would allow them to better  prepare application packages for the consular officers to adjudicate.
Although State provides guidance and training on adjudicating E-2 visas,  consular officers, managers, and LES identified challenges in the E-2  adjudication process, such as ensuring adjudicators adequately  understand supporting financial and business documents.
To determine the outcomes and characteristics of foreign nationals who  have sought or received E-2 status, we analyzed data from State’s  Bureau of Consular Affairs and USCIS on E-2 visa applications and  petitions adjudicated from fiscal years 2014 through 2018."
889,"Specifically, section 705(a) of the NDAA 2017  required DOD to develop and implement value-based incentive programs  in its contracts to help improve the quality of health care services  provided to eligible TRICARE beneficiaries by rewarding civilian providers  with additional payments for improved performance based on certain  metrics.
Specifically, in this report,  DHA described its intent to implement three value-based pilots in  response to section 705(a) of the NDAA 2017—(1) the Performance- Based Maternity Payments Pilot, (2) the Medication Adherence Pilot, and  (3) the High-Value Primary Care Provider Pilot—through modifications to  its TRICARE contracts over the next 6 to 18 months."
890,"Within FAA’s Office of Aviation Safety, the UAS Integration Office is  responsible for facilitating the safe, efficient, and timely integration of UAS  into the national airspace system; aligning UAS international activities  with foreign civil-aviation authorities; supporting standards and policy  development related to UAS projects; and providing strategic planning  and support for continuous UAS research and development.
According to FAA and stakeholders  we spoke to, in addition to costs to continue regulatory activities and  safety oversight, FAA’s future costs will depend on the extent of FAA’s  involvement in the everyday operation and oversight of systems, such as  those related to UAS traffic management, and the extent to which FAA  becomes a provider of UAS-related services.
Planning and  Consideration of  Policy Goals Are Key  to Designing UAS  Fee Mechanisms Considerations for  Determining How to Set  and Collect Fees In the tasking statement to the Drone Advisory Committee’s Task Group  3, FAA asked the committee to recommend options for funding the  activities and services required by both government and industry to safely  integrate UAS into the national airspace system.
For example,  policy makers may decide not to recover these costs based on the  idea that the goal of promulgating UAS-related regulations may be  related to the general safety of the airspace, rather than providing  benefits to specific users.
For instance, collecting  information on costs and beneficiaries as new UAS-related services are  developed and implemented could ensure that data needed to design  effective user fees are available.
As an example of the type of  planning that may be needed, FAA officials said that identifying the costs  of UAS traffic management services for the purpose of setting fees would  involve (1) tracking which UAS are using the national airspace and (2)  tracking and categorizing the type of operations conducted."
891,"Progress toward  Environmental Justice  Is Difficult to Gauge Agencies’ progress in identifying and addressing environmental justice  issues related to their missions is difficult to gauge because most of the  agencies do not have updated strategic plans and have not reported  annually on their progress or developed methods to assess progress.
We recommended that EPA, as chair of the working  group, should develop guidance for the agencies on what they should  include in their environmental justice strategic plans."
892,"NRC on several occasions reassessed and  repeatedly reaffirmed its use of the occurrence of prompt fatalities and  deterministic health effects as its primary criteria for measuring the  consequences of an RDD, including when developing its decision-making  framework in 2004, reviewing its regulatory framework after the  Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, and in its 2014 response to  recommendations from the Radiation Source Protection and Security  Task Force (the Task Force).
NRC’s reliance on prompt fatalities and deterministic health effects and its  exclusion of socioeconomic consequences and deaths from evacuations  as criteria for determining the consequences of an RDD, as discussed  earlier, has resulted in security requirements that do not include all high- risk quantities of some radioactive materials.
Although NRC chose to limit its 2016 evaluation of  Part 37 to only category 1 and 2 quantities of material, experts who  participated in our meeting generally said that they consider certain  category 3 quantities of radioactive material high risk based on their  potential consequences if used in an RDD, and data from recent studies  support this determination.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following three recommendations to the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission: The Chairman of NRC should direct NRC staff to consider  socioeconomic consequences and fatalities from evacuations in the  criteria for determining what security measures should be required for  radioactive materials that could be used in an RDD.
Specifically, it disagreed  with our recommendations that it (1) consider socioeconomic  consequences and fatalities from evacuations when determining security  measures for radioactive materials; and (2) require licensees to  implement additional security measures when they have multiple  quantities of category 3 americium-241 at a single facility that in total  reach a category 1 or 2 quantity."
893,"FEMA Has Taken  Steps to Strengthen  Disaster Resilience,  but Additional Actions  are Needed to Fully  Address Remaining  Challenges We have previously reported on the extent to which FEMA programs  encourage disaster resilience during recovery efforts and our prior and  ongoing work also highlight opportunities to improve disaster resilience  nationwide.
We recommended, among other  things, that FEMA (1) standardize planning efforts for hazard mitigation  after a disaster and (2) develop performance measures for the Public  Assistance grant program to better align with FEMA’s strategic goal for  hazard mitigation in the recovery process.
Specifically, we reported on FEMA’s use of its redesigned delivery model  for providing grants under the Public Assistance program, as well as the  alternative procedures for administering or receiving such grant funds that  FEMA allows states, territories, and local governments to use for their  recovery.
We recommended, among other things, that FEMA develop and  implement a methodology that more comprehensively assesses a  jurisdiction’s capacity to respond to and recover from a disaster without  federal assistance, including fiscal capacity and consideration of  response and recovery capabilities.
In September 2018,  we reported that local officials continued to experience challenges with  using the new Public Assistance web-based, case management system  following the 2017 disasters, such as not having sufficient guidance on  how to use the new system and delays with FEMA’s processing of their  projects.
Based on our findings from our November and December 2017 reports,  we recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) complete  workforce staffing assessments that identify the appropriate number of  staff needed to implement the redesigned Public Assistance delivery  model, and (2) document steps for hiring, training, and retaining key  appeals staff, and address staff transitions resulting from deployments to  disasters."
894,"State and Local  Governments Will  Need to Make Policy  Changes to Achieve  Fiscal Balance Our simulations suggest that the sector will likely continue to face a  difference between revenues and expenditures during the next 50 years,  as measured by its operating balance.
One way of measuring the long-term fiscal challenges faced by the state  and local government sector is through an indicator known as the “fiscal  gap.” The fiscal gap is an estimate of annual changes in expenditures  and in revenues our simulations suggest would be needed to maintain the  operating balance equal to zero during the 50-year simulation period.
Several factors, or key model variables, could affect the state and local  government sector’s long-term fiscal outlook, including economic growth,  health care excess cost growth, and the rate of return on pension assets."
895,"The Act entitles financial institutions that choose to offer a private  student loan rehabilitation program that meets the Act’s requirements a  safe harbor from potential inaccurate information claims under FCRA  related to the removal of the private student loan default from a credit  report.
The  scores can be developed internally by credit providers or with the  assistance of external parties such as FICO or the three nationwide  CRAs. Federal Oversight of  Private Student Loans CFPB has supervisory authority over certain private student loan lenders,  including banks and credit unions with over $10 billion in assets and all  nonbanks, for compliance with Federal consumer financial laws.
CFPB officials told us the agency has not made any determination on  whether it plans to clarify for nonbanks—including for-profit nonbank  lenders and nonbank state lenders—if they have the authority under  FCRA to have private student loan defaults removed from credit reports  for borrowers who have completed a rehabilitation program.
However, the removal of defaults from credit reports resulting from loan  rehabilitation programs is unlikely to affect financial institutions’ ability to  make sound lending decisions, according to prudential regulator officials  and representatives from three private student lenders and three other  credit providers with whom we spoke.
The  letter notes, however, that the Act requires federal credit unions that offer  such programs to remove private student loan defaults from consumer  credit reports if borrowers successfully complete a rehabilitation program."
896,"In responding to our survey, 46 state CISOs reported the extent to which  they had experienced a very great, great, moderate, slight, or no increase  in calendar time; staff hours; and costs of acquiring additional materials,  software, and equipment to address variances in selected federal  agencies’ cybersecurity requirements.
Selected Federal  Agencies’ Policies  Addressed a Majority  of Activities for  Coordinating with  State Agencies When  Assessing  Cybersecurity, but Did  Not Address  Coordinating with  Each Other As previously discussed, OMB Circular A-130 requires federal agencies  to assess whether state agencies have implemented effective security  and privacy controls on information systems that create, collect, use,  process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of federal  information.
(Recommendation 2) The Administrator of CMS should, in collaboration with OMB, solicit  input from FBI, IRS, SSA, and state agency stakeholders on revisions  to its security policy to ensure that cybersecurity requirements for  state agencies are consistent with other federal agencies and NIST  guidance to the greatest extent possible and document CMS’s  rationale for maintaining any requirements variances.
(Recommendation 4) The FBI Director should, in collaboration with OMB, solicit input from  CMS, IRS, SSA, and state agency stakeholders on revisions to its  security policy to ensure that cybersecurity requirements for state  agencies are consistent with other federal agencies and NIST  guidance to the greatest extent possible.
(Recommendation 7) The IRS Commissioner should, in collaboration with OMB, solicit input  from CMS, FBI, SSA, and state agency stakeholders on revisions to  its security policy to ensure that cybersecurity requirements for state  agencies are consistent with other federal agencies and NIST  guidance to the greatest extent possible.
(Recommendation 9) The Commissioner of SSA should, in collaboration with OMB, solicit  input from CMS, FBI, IRS, and state agency stakeholders on revisions  to its security policy to ensure that cybersecurity requirements for  state agencies are consistent with other federal agencies and NIST  guidance to the greatest extent possible and document the SSA’s  rationale for maintaining any requirements variances."
897,"In addition, in accordance with the MGT Act, the guidance provided  details regarding a Technology Modernization Board, which is to consist  of (1) the Federal CIO; (2) a senior IT official from the General Services  Administration; (3) a member of DHS’s National Protection and Program  Directorate; and (4) four federal employees with technical expertise in IT  development, financial management, cybersecurity and privacy, and  acquisition that were appointed by the Director of OMB.
Our update to the IT acquisitions and operations high-risk area also  stressed that OMB and agencies needed to continue to implement our  prior recommendations in order to improve their ability to effectively and  efficiently invest in IT.
As stated in our 2019 high-risk update, OMB and agencies should  demonstrate government-wide progress by, among other things,  implementing at least 80 percent of our recommendations related to  managing IT acquisitions and operations.
Overall, federal agencies would be better positioned to realize billions in  cost savings and additional management improvements if they address  these recommendations, including those aimed at implementing CIO  responsibilities, reviewing IT acquisitions, improving data center  consolidation, and managing software licenses.
Second, OMB’s guidance did not ensure that CIOs had a significant role  in (1) IT planning, programming, and budgeting decisions; and (2)  execution decisions and the management, governance, and oversight  processes related to IT, as required by federal law and guidance."
898,"Our best practices for knowledge-based acquisitions  state that before program baselines are set, programs should hold key  systems engineering events, such as a preliminary design review, to help  ensure that requirements are defined and feasible and that the proposed  design can be met within cost, schedule, and other system constraints."
899,"The Coast Guard’s 2018 report to Congress on its modernization effort  acknowledged that the risk of complications increases significantly with  large-scale reorganization efforts, such as modernization, and noted that  such changes require formal processes to look for complications as they  arise and to fully assess their impact on the organization, including its  workforce.
Additionally, we  assessed the extent to which the Coast Guard’s reorganization of its  reserve component applied key reform practices under the Leadership  focus and attention, Managing and monitoring and Strategic workforce  planning subcategories.
According to Coast Guard officials from the Office of  Resource, Organizational Analysis, and Workforce Management, as the  effort moved from the planning stages to implementation, the team  consolidated the goals in the Coast Guard’s 10 modernization initiatives  into five main reorganization efforts.
For each of the key reform practices that were not fully implemented, we  found that the Coast Guard’s organizational change request process and  associated guidance documents did not require such practices to be  followed, nor did they require tracking implementation of changes,  collecting data to measure progress, or assessing employee satisfaction.
By updating its manpower  requirements plan to include time frames and milestones for completing  MRAs and determinations for all positions in all units, the Coast Guard  can track progress toward its goal and make necessary adjustments in its  planning, as needed.
With regard to our first recommendation, DHS stated that the Coast  Guard’s Office of Resources, Organizational Analysis, and Workforce  Management will update the Coast Guard Organizational Manual to  establish policy requiring that requests to change organizational structure  include a plan, and establish a mechanism to track implementation and  measure progress in achieving organizational change goals.
Finally, we reviewed documents and  information on these efforts to assess workforce requirements, and  compared them against Coast Guard guidance on organizational changes  for conducting the manpower requirements determination process, and  our prior work related to strategic human capital management."
900,"In addition to the factors identified in the GSA’s internal construction-cost  study, GSA officials said that meeting other statutory requirements, for  example, the Buy American Act and the Federal Information Security  Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), can contribute to higher costs for  federal projects compared to private sector projects.
In all of the five case-study projects we reviewed, we found the  associated PMPs generally: outlined the project’s scope, cost, and schedule information;  identified GSA’s project stakeholders—such as GSA’s project  manager and GSA’s contracting officer—and representatives for the  tenant agencies that the project will benefit; and  identified potential risks posed to the delivery of the project.
For example, one peer review  report included the following observations:  The project team showed great progress toward completing the  project on time, and potentially ahead of schedule; the  implementation of the recommendations made during the initial  external peer review resolved potential unknowns and cost issues  that would have put the project at high financial risk; the safety  record was exceptional; tenants were better informed; and  security issues had been streamlined, allowing the contractor to  staff the project in a timely manner.
According to GSA officials and summary data on its rebaselining  decisions, the majority of GSA’s major construction projects within our 5- year scope were rebaselined, within its policy, to account for changes to  projects’ costs and schedules.
To balance OMB’s guidance  to agencies that POEs should be conducted on agencies’ completed  capital-construction projects, and given its resource constraints, GSA  could benefit from a more strategic approach to select the projects for  POEs. For example, GSA could use a risk-based approach to select for  POEs (e.g., more expensive projects or those that include the integration  of advanced, state-of-the-art building systems) to help improve the design  and construction of future projects.
Recommendations for  Executive Action We are making the following three recommendations to GSA:  The Administrator of the GSA should report for Congress and the public— for example, on GSA’s prospectus website—the extent to which  completed projects’ construction costs and schedules were rebaselined  and final construction costs, to include any additional funding tenant  agencies may have provided to GSA for changes."
901,Requiring additional taxpayers to  electronically file tax and information returns could help IRS improve  compliance in a resource-efficient way.
902,"Further, according to ICE officials, ICE will try to  transfer pregnant women from their initial detention facility to an IHSC- staffed detention facility or a family residential center—if she is part of a  family unit—to ensure they are provided the appropriate accommodations  and care.
Specifically, we identified 16 topics related to the care of pregnant women  and found that in most facility types, ICE had at least one policy or  detention standard that addressed many of these topics.
In addition, we found that from calendar years 2016 through  2018, 64 percent of the detentions of pregnant women were initially  detained at the two facility types that had the most policies or detention  standards related to each of the pregnancy topics, as of December 2019.
Further, IHSC officials stated that they are revising  IHSC’s Women’s Health Directive and guidance on care for chronic  conditions to include required and recommended vaccines for pregnant  women and HIV care, respectively—which will address these gaps at  IHSC-staffed facilities.
In addition to these updates, in accordance with ICE’s December 2017  memo on Identification and Monitoring of Pregnant Detainees, ICE is to  ensure pregnant detainees receive appropriate medical care, and ensure  detention facilities are aware of their obligations regarding directives and  detention standards that apply to pregnant detainees, among other  things.
In addition to policies that direct the care of pregnant women, although  CBP does not have training dedicated to the care of pregnant women  specifically, CBP provides initial and annual refresher training on its  national standards for the transport, escort, detention, and search of  detainees, which includes requirements for pregnant women.
DHS Inspections,  Medical Data, and  Complaints Offer  Insights into the Care  Provided to Pregnant  Women ICE Inspections Found 79  Percent or Greater  Compliance with Most of  Its Pregnancy-Related  Performance Measures ICE uses various inspections for accessing facilities’ compliance with  policies and detention standards—the frequency and focus of which  vary.
Our analysis of available medical data for IHSC-staffed facilities and  interviews with pregnant detainees and NGOs provides additional  perspectives regarding these issues on the care of pregnant women.
Specifically, we matched ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) records for  pregnant women detained during calendar years 2016 through 2018 with  individual-level detention dataset the ICE Integrated Decision Support  (IIDS) database to determine the total number of detentions of pregnant  women, as well as the length of detention, facility location, case  category status, arresting agency, gestation of pregnancy, when the  pregnancy test was conducted, and whether there is an associated  criminal conviction (criminality).
The policy refers  to ICE’s responsibility to monitor detention facilities and ensure they meet  national detention standard requirements to provide all newly admitted  detainees an initial medical screening including pregnancy screening."
903,"We estimate that federal revenue  losses due to market shifts from roll-your-own to pipe tobacco and from  small to large cigars range from approximately $2.5 to $3.9 billion from  April 2009 through September 2018, depending on assumptions about  how consumers would respond to a tax increase.
We estimated what the effect on tax revenue collection would have been  if the sales trends for roll-your-own and pipe tobacco and for small and  large cigars had not been affected by substitution between the products  but had been affected by the increase in price due to the tax—in other  words, if the market shifts resulting from the substitution of higher-taxed  products with lower-taxed products had not occurred.
Our estimate of federal revenue losses resulting from differences in  federal excise tax rates among smoking tobacco products includes  combined tax revenue losses for the roll-your-own and pipe tobacco  markets as well as the small and large cigar markets."
904,"If CBP or ICE determines that a family separation is warranted, agents or  officers process the child or children as UAC, according to Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE officials.
As a result,  Border Patrol and OFO officials stated that its agents and officers typically  determine whether ICE has space in its family residential centers before  processing family units into expedited removal proceedings.
On October 2, 2015, the  Chief of the Border Patrol issued policy guidance requiring agents to  process family units together in its data system with a unique identifier  called a “family unit number,” which links the records of parents and  children apprehended together.
We raised these inconsistencies to Border Patrol headquarters officials in  April 2019, and they acknowledged that certain policy and training  documents contained inaccurate definitions and guidance, which could  have led some agents to process certain parents and children separately,  without a family unit number to link their records.
A CBP policy issued on June 27,  2018, states that “fraudulent claims of family relationships” should be  processed under “current CBP policies and procedures.” In practice, this  means that agents and officers are to consider the validity of family  relationships on a case-by-case basis with the information they have  available at that time, according to Border Patrol and OFO headquarters  officials.
Specifically, according to Border Patrol and OFO officials and  documents, agents and officers are to indicate in their data systems that  the adult and child were separated and the reason why, and then refer  the child to ORR as a UAC.
That is, if the appropriate Border Patrol and OFO managers give  approval, agents and officers separate potentially invalid family units, and  record the separation and the reason for it in agency data systems,  according to Border Patrol and OFO officials and documents.
While CBP tracks cases on potentially invalid family units in its data  systems, this tracking does not (1) document the circumstances to  support the assessment of invalidity or (2) provide complete and timely  information for ORR and ICE to help them to fulfill their responsibilities,  including to review cases in which CBP initially determined a family to be  invalid but further investigation is needed.
Providing guidance on what narrative information  Border Patrol agents and OFO officers are to document on a child’s and  the accompanying adult’s Forms I-213 about potentially invalid family  units could help better ensure that the events are well-documented to  support such assessments, in accordance with CBP policy.
In addition, without additional guidance on  what specific details Border Patrol agents and OFO officers are to include  in the narrative information about the family separation events on the  parent’s and child’s Forms I-213, ICE and ORR do not have complete or  consistent information to use in determining when it may be necessary to  reunify family units in accordance with the Ms. L.
Additionally, without additional guidance on what specific  information about the circumstances of the family separations Border  Patrol agents and OFO officers are to include on the parent’s and child’s  Forms I-213, ICE and ORR do not have sufficient information to  determine, among other things, when family reunifications are required.
For example, in response to several of our  recommendations that CBP provide additional or revised guidance and  training to agents and officers, DHS stated that Border Patrol issued a  memo in January 2020 to clarify what information agents are to record for  family unit members, potentially invalid family units, and subsequent  separations, if applicable."
905,"OCSLA, as amended, directs BOEM to establish minimum bid levels,  rental fees, royalty rates, and other related fees to assure receipt of fair  market value to the U.S. government for lands leased on the Outer  Continental Shelf and the rights conveyed by the federal government.
BOEM’s Fair Market Value Review Committee oversees the development  of tract-specific parameters—production potential, probability of geologic  success, economic projections, and development costs and timeframes— that the bureau uses in its proprietary discounted cash flow analysis  model.
BOEM uses these assessments to estimate, under existing  fiscal terms, results for the lease sales covered by the analysis— including the amount of bonus bids collected and the number of tracts  sold—as well as resulting production and net economic value under  various price scenarios.
BOEM’s valuations for tracts were generally low relative  to industry bids, largely due to the cumulative effect of three aspects of its  bid valuation process: (1) the bureau forecasts conservatively to account  for uncertainties, (2) the bureau forecasts unreasonably high levels of  depreciation, and (3) BOEM selectively further lowers many valuations  from its model to justify accepting bids it otherwise would reject.
BOEM officials told us that this conservative approach  represents fair market value because the objective of the bureau’s tract  valuation process is to lease tracts and collect associated revenues  except when BOEM determines a tract is worth significantly more than  the highest bid received.
BOEM officials told us  that when bids are slightly below the bureau’s initial valuations—and  therefore would be rejected per BOEM’s procedures for ensuring receipt  of fair market value—BOEM reviews and adjusts its forecasting  parameters then reruns its model in order to produce new valuations,  which they told us can—and which the data indicate generally do—result  in lower valuations that justify accepting the bids.
However,  BOEM’s valuation process might not fully assure receipt of fair market  value for sale of offshore oil and gas leases because it systematically  reduces the thresholds for accepting bids even though rejecting them  could lead to significantly increased revenue.
As evidenced by our econometric modeling  results, during the 1996 through 2000 period, we observed higher bidding  when no price threshold provisions were included in lease terms,  suggesting that industry accounted for the expectation of no royalties  when developing bids."
906,"Based on our analysis of agency documentation and  interviews with agency officials, we determined that CBP, USCIS, and  ICE require different information about family members who are  apprehended together and each component collects such information that  is relevant to its respective operational needs.
Without identifying and communicating department- wide information needs with respect to family members who have been  apprehended together, DHS does not have reasonable assurance that its  components are identifying all individuals who may be eligible for relief  from removal from the United States based on their family relationships or  that ICE can provide ORR with the information it needs to help evaluate  the suitability of potential sponsors for UAC.
However, our analysis of DHS documentation and  interviews with officials indicate that CBP does not routinely collect all of  the information about family members that is needed to (1) identify  eligible dependents as part of the credible fear screening process and (2)  evaluate family members for sponsorship placement for UAC.
CBP does not routinely collect sufficient  information about relationships between family members apprehended  together for USCIS and ICE to later identify if such individuals are eligible  dependents as part of the credible fear screening process.
Specifically, because CBP officers and agents do  not routinely collect information about the relationships between spouses  or parents and children age 18 to 21 or document such information on the  record of apprehension at the time they are apprehended, USCIS and  ICE do not have the information about those family relationships that they  need to locate and identify eligible dependents."
907,"One study that examined additional racial groups found high  earnings among children of low-income Asian households, and found  that Asians are likely to remain at income levels comparable to or  above-white Americans, though these findings are largely driven by  first-generation immigrants.
Millennials Have  Similar Average  Incomes and Lower  Average Net Worth  Compared to  Previous Generations  Despite Being More  Educated If economic mobility is flat or falling, knowing how a cohort is doing at the  beginning of its members’ working lives sheds light on the potential  challenges that lie ahead as the cohort ages and moves toward  retirement.
Millennials Had Lower  Levels of Net Worth Than  Previous Generations,  With Lower  Homeownership Rates  and Higher Student Debt Overall, Millennial households in 2016 had significantly lower average  and median net worth, defined as assets minus debt, than Generation X  households at similar ages in 2001, according to our analysis of SCF data  (see figs.
As a part of our analysis of net worth, we examined specific types of  assets and debt, including homeownership, retirement resources, and  student loans, and found the following: Millennials had lower rates of homeownership compared to  previous generations."
908,"In comparison, 8 percent of veterans getting health care provided  or purchased by VHA received any treatment for a diagnosed SUD in  fiscal year 2017, including individuals who received specialty SUD  services as well as individuals who received non-specialty services in, for  example, primary care or general mental health clinics.
Most Veterans Received  Specialty SUD Services in  Outpatient Settings;  Medication-Assisted  Treatment Has Increased  for Opioid Use Disorders  in Recent Years Our analysis of VHA data shows that veterans received specialty SUD  services from VHA’s health care systems in multiple settings from fiscal  years 2014 through 2018, with most veterans receiving these services in  outpatient settings.
Below, we provide information on  utilization and expenditures for specialty SUD services in outpatient and  residential treatment programs and for medication-assisted treatment for  veterans with opioid use disorder.
Our analysis of VHA data shows  the number and proportion of veterans with an opioid use disorder who  received medication-assisted treatment from VHA’s health care systems  has risen in recent years, as shown in table 4."
909,"The Navy’s largest overseas  maintenance facility, SRF-JRMC is located in Yokosuka and is  responsible for the maintenance of 12 surface ships homeported there— including the most destroyers and the only cruisers based outside of the  United States.
As a result of maintenance schedules not being completed on time, all  four overseas Navy homeports with surface ships we analyzed— Yokosuka, Japan; Sasebo, Japan; Rota, Spain; and Manama, Bahrain— experienced a total of 3,475 days ships were in maintenance beyond their  expected durations—referred to in this report as days of maintenance  delay.
For example, the Naval Inspector General  found that the shortage of personnel at the FDRMC and Fleet Logistics  Center in Bahrain resulted in contracting milestones being routinely  missed for ships based there, and once these ships were in maintenance,  the growth in work to be completed grew by an average of $830,000 for  maintenance periods in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.
While several different Navy entities have a variety of efforts underway  related to issues associated with ship maintenance delays, without  designating an entity to conduct a comprehensive, systematic analysis to  identify and understand the underlying causes maintenance periods grow  beyond planned schedules, the Navy risks continuing to underestimate  maintenance needs and the time and resources required to address  them.
Further, without conducting such an analysis to understand the  underlying, interrelated causes of these delays, and incorporating this  analysis into a comprehensive results-oriented plan to address them, the  Navy cannot effectively target corrective actions to improve timely  completion of ship maintenance to ensure ships are available for the  critical training crews need and operations to support U.S. military and  national security goals.
Navy officials said that the new maintenance approach in Rota has been  successful because the Navy:  selected four ships with a high degree of commonality; for example,  the ships were of similar age, systems, and equipment configuration,  which helped facilitate planning for and conducting maintenance; ensured the ships received all needed maintenance and  modernization before being sent to Spain, and arrived from the United  States in good condition, which reduced the likelihood that they would  require unexpected maintenance while overseas; designed the maintenance center and its staffing around the  maintenance approach for the four destroyers; and  coordinated with the contractor in Spain to ensure it had sufficient  workforce and resources, including capacity to surge resources if  additional work is discovered so that it can be completed on time.
However, Navy officials and our analysis identified several challenges: (1)  U.S. industrial base maintenance capacity limitations, (2) maintenance  delays in the United States and overseas, (3) the ability of the overseas  contractor industrial base to support future workload in Japan, and (4)  differences in the operating environments between Spain and Japan.
For example, according to officials, the Navy plans to base an  additional amphibious ship in Sasebo, Japan, by fiscal year 2020, and  the Navy is examining a possible increase to the number of  destroyers in Rota, Spain.
We used Navy data to  identify depot-level maintenance periods conducted at each homeport  starting in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and to assess the extent to  which maintenance schedules for ships based overseas were executed as planned from fiscal year 2014 through 2018, and the delays  experienced."
910,"Indicators of Potential  Fraud or Error in  Income and Family  Size Information Pose  Risks to IDR Plans Over 95,000 IDR Plans  Were Held by Borrowers  Reporting No Income, but  Data Suggests They May  Have Had Enough Wages  to Make Student Loan  Payments Our analysis of Education’s IDR plan data and HHS’s NDNH wage data  for borrowers who reported zero income found that about 95,100  approved IDR plans (11 percent of all IDR plans we analyzed) were held  by borrowers who may have had sufficient wages to warrant a monthly  student loan payment.
Our results from matching the Education and HHS data indicate the  possibility that some borrowers misrepresented or erroneously reported  their income, highlighting the risk of potential fraud and errors in IDR  plans.
Officials from Education and three of the four loan servicers we spoke  with acknowledged that IDR plans are at risk for fraud or error because  verification is generally not performed on borrower reports of zero income  and borrower reports of family size.
Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology This report examines (1) whether there are indicators of potential fraud or  error in income and family size information provided by borrowers seeking  to repay their loans with Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans and (2)  the extent to which the Department of Education (Education) verifies this  information.
To determine whether there were indicators of potential fraud or error in  borrowers’ income and family size information on IDR plans, we obtained  data from Education’s Enterprise Data Warehouse and Analytics (EDWA)  database on borrowers with William D."

913,"TMF Operating Expenses  Are to be Offset by  Administrative Fee  Collection, but Collected  Fees Have Been Less  Than Planned According to the MGT Act, the TMF Program Management Office may  obligate funds to cover its operating expenses out of the appropriations  received for the fund (totaling $125 million as of August 2019) in order to  provide support to the Technology Modernization Board in meeting its  responsibilities.
The fee rates were set in June 2018 with the intent to operate the fund as  a full cost recovery model, meaning that the Program Management Office  planned to fully recover all operating expenses through administrative fee  collection by fiscal year 2029 if the office’s assumptions regarding  appropriation levels and project selections were met.
Since the fund was established in December 2017, OMB, the Technology  Modernization Board, and the TMF Program Management Office have  provided oversight of the fund’s awarded projects by requiring the  respective agencies to provide quarterly updates on the status of project  milestones and transferring additional funds only when milestones were  reached.
Unless OMB and the TMF Program Management Office  take steps to develop a plan that outlines the actions needed to fully  recover TMF operating expenses with administrative fee collection in a  timely manner, there will be fewer funds available to award to projects  that are intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of  government IT systems.
If OMB and GSA do not clarify the  requirement that agencies follow Circular A-11’s cost estimating process  (that references GAO’s cost estimating guidance discussed in this report),  agencies are at risk of continuing to provide unreliable cost information in  their proposals to the Technology Modernization Board.
Because of the number of factors that are likely to affect fee collection, it  will be critical that OMB and the TMF Program Management Office take  steps to develop a plan that outlines the actions needed to fully recover  TMF operating expenses with administrative fee collection in a timely  manner in order to maximize the funds available for awards.
An important aspect to  the success of the TMF will be clarifying the established requirement that  agencies follow Circular A-11’s cost estimating process (that references  GAO’s cost estimating guidance discussed in this report) in order to help  ensure that the reliability of estimated savings for awarded projects is  improved.
(Recommendation 4) The Administrator of General Services should develop detailed guidance  for completing the Technology Modernization Fund project cost estimate  template, including information on the data elements and the fields  required to be completed, in order to help ensure the accuracy and  completeness of the provided information.
We agree with the importance of ensuring approved projects meet the  requirements of the MGT Act. In our report, we acknowledged OMB,  the Technology Modernization Board, and the TMF Program  Management Office’s efforts to provide oversight of the fund’s  awarded projects.
Due to changes to the project’s schedule, an official responsible for the  management of the Farmers.Gov Portal project reported that the agency  plans to delay requesting the remaining balance of $6 million in awarded  funds from the Technology Modernization Board until fiscal year 2020."

917,"According to our  reviews of policy language, reports from and interviews with Treasury,  researchers, insurers, and other industry stakeholders, the expiration of  TRIA and the absence of an alternative backstop to terrorism risk  insurance would cause disruptions to the market.
According to Treasury’s reports analyzing industry data,  the majority of commercial policyholders in the United States purchase  terrorism risk insurance, and at a relatively small percentage of total  premiums.
In the absence of a loss-sharing program, insurers likely would limit  coverage, exit certain markets, or attempt to increase capacity, according  to our review of reports from the federal government, researchers,  industry entities, and interviews with industry stakeholders.
In the absence of a loss-sharing program, some  insurers likely would exit certain markets, no longer offering terrorism  coverage in specific geographic locations or lines of insurance, according  to federal and industry reports and interviews with stakeholders.

We stressed that OMB  and federal agencies should continue to expeditiously implement FITARA  and OMB’s related guidance, which includes enhancing CIO authority,  consolidating data centers, and acquiring and managing software  licenses.
Overall, federal agencies would be better positioned to realize billions in  cost savings and additional management improvements if they address  these recommendations, including those aimed at implementing CIO  responsibilities, reviewing IT acquisitions; improving data center  consolidation; and managing software licenses.

The interagency committee’s biennial reports describe general types of  activities individual agencies reported conducting—often in coordination  with nonfederal partners such as nongovernmental organizations,  industry, states, Indian tribes, and other nations—to address marine  debris, which include activities in the following categories: (1) education  and outreach; (2) legislation, regulation, and policy; (3) cleanup; (4)  research and technology development; and (5) coordination (see table 1  for descriptions of types of activities in each category; see app.
NOAA officials described their actions in response to  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017, which included coordinating  debris removal activities across federal and state agencies, such as EPA  and Florida State’s Department of Environmental Protection.
By  developing a process to identify recommendations for priority funding  needs in its biennial reports, the interagency committee could provide  Congress with required information about priority funding needs across  the federal government to address marine debris.
NOAA officials agreed that restricting the sale of single-use plastic  bags could help address the marine debris problem, but said that  identifying an agency with sufficient legal authority to be responsible  for implementing and enforcing any restriction would be important and  could be a challenge at the federal level.
By establishing a time frame for developing a  documented membership process, NOAA and the interagency committee  can benefit from capturing all members’ activities, and ensuring it  provides Congress a complete picture of marine debris efforts across the  federal government.

Deployment of Medical  Staff and Temporary  Facilities During the response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, ASPR and some of its  ESF#8 support agencies—DOD and VA—deployed medical staff and  temporary medical facilities to respond to the public health and medical  needs in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
ASPR placed Disaster Medical  Assistance Teams in front of the major hospitals in the U.S. Virgin  Islands and Puerto Rico to triage patients and to relieve the hospitals’  emergency departments by treating patients with acute care needs  during the response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Under this strategy, ASPR designated San Juan’s  Centro Medico hospital as the “hub” of activity with six “spokes”  delivering care to the island’s population centers, and placed Federal  Medical Stations in tents in front of each hospital, including the  “hub.” USNS Comfort Deployed to Puerto Rico to  Respond to Hurricane Maria   The USNS Comfort is a seagoing medical  treatment facility that had more than 850  medical and support staff embarked as part of  the public health and medical services  response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico,  according to Department of Defense (DOD)  officials.
As an example of the misalignment of resources, DOD officials told us  that, through FEMA, ASPR requested that DOD provide stand-alone  medical assistance teams (i.e., teams of medical personnel and  equipment, similar to ASPR’s Disaster Medical Assistance Teams) to  deliver medical care to the hurricane survivors in the U.S. Virgin Islands  and Puerto Rico.
ASPR and its support  agencies, such as DOD, undertook numerous actions to address the  public health and medical needs in the territories—including evacuating  critical care and dialysis patients from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto  Rico."

Specifically, FAA found  that the benefits to airspace users of using enhanced ADS-C to enable  new minimum separation standards, such as improved access to fuel- efficient altitudes, outweighed, by 2 to 1, the total costs, including FAA’s  costs to upgrade ATOP and the aircraft operators’ data costs due to more  ADS-C position reports.
According to FAA officials and air traffic controllers we  spoke with, the current minimum separation standards (i.e., 30 nautical  miles lateral and longitudinal) are rarely used as the density of aircraft  traffic in U.S. oceanic airspace does not require such close spacing.
As a result, FAA officials do not plan to use the new  minimum separation standards enabled by space-based ADS-B (i.e., 19  nautical miles lateral and 17 nautical miles longitudinal) until FAA can  further address how to implement these standards in U.S. oceanic  airspace.
According to FAA officials and documentation, using space-based ADS-B  to enable the use of new minimum separation standards in U.S. oceanic  airspace will be reviewed and evaluated over the next 5 or more years.
Based on the results of this initiative, program officials told us they  could start preparing for an investment decision on using space-based  ADS-B in oceanic airspace to enable the use of new minimum separation  standards in 2025 or later.
These internal FAA documents included the  ASEPS Concept of Operations, the Initial and Final Business Case  Analyses, the Final Investment Decision Benefits Basis of Estimate, and a  Safety Risk Management Assessment of space-based ADS-B and  enhanced ADS-C."
925,"We recommended in our December 2018  report that FEMA update its guidance to provide specific direction for  contracting officers to perform outreach to states and localities on the use  and establishment of advance contracts.
Implementing our recommendations to update its planning  guidance and advance contract strategy; assess acquisition workforce  needs; improve coordination with state, local, and federal partners; and  improve tracking of disaster contracting actions will help FEMA overcome  key challenges it faces in contracting during a disaster, and improve  future response efforts."
926,"While states will still have the option to apply pay-and- chase procedures to these claims, a state may instead choose—if it  determines doing so is cost-effective and will not adversely affect  access to care—to require the provider to first submit the claim to the  third party and wait 90 days for payment by the third party before  seeking Medicaid payment.
Under federal law, beginning in October  2019, for claims for services to CSE beneficiaries, states may choose  to make payment within 30 days (as opposed to implementing a 100- day wait-and-see period), if the state determines doing so is cost- effective and necessary to ensure access to care.
However, prior to enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 in  February 2018, federal third-party liability law did not authorize states to  apply cost avoidance procedures to preventive pediatric claims or  pediatric services provided to CSE beneficiaries."
927,"According to DOD officials leading the transition to IPv6, the department  utilizes IPv4 for enterprise-wide and mission partner wired and wireless  communications, including infrastructure, technologies, and devices  supporting large-scale globally dispersed command and control systems,  naval vessels, aircraft, satellites, and ground operations.
In  addition to the general benefits of eliminating IPv4 address space  limitations, enhancing mobility features, and integrating IP security, IPv6  has the potential to enhance DOD battlefield operations, improve  decision-making with the increased reliance on the Internet of Things  (IoT), support U.S. global technological competitiveness, and enhance  mission partner interoperability.
Specific to planning for the transition, the memorandum required  agencies to assign an official to lead and coordinate IPv6 transition  planning efforts, complete an inventory of IP-compliant devices and  technologies, and complete an impact analysis comprised of a cost  estimate and a risk analysis by specific due dates during fiscal year  2006."
928,"We also stressed that  the Bureau needed to rigorously test census-taking activities; ensure that  scheduling adheres to best practices; improve its ability to manage,  develop, and secure its IT systems; and have better oversight and control  over its cost estimation process.
The 2020 Census  Remains High Risk  Due to Challenges  Facing the  Enumeration The 2020 Census is on our list of high-risk programs because, among  other things, (1) innovations never before used in prior enumerations are  not expected to be fully tested, (2) the Bureau continues to face  challenges in implementing IT systems, (3) the Bureau faces significant  cybersecurity risks to its systems and data, and (4) the Bureau’s cost  estimate for the 2020 Census was unreliable.
According to the Bureau’s risk management framework, the systems  expected to be used to conduct the 2020 Census will need to have  complete security documentation (such as system security plans) and an  approved authorization to operate prior to their use.
Specifically, the Bureau is working with DHS to  ensure a scalable and secure network connection for the 2020 Census  respondents (e.g., virtual Trusted Internet Connection with the cloud),  improve its cybersecurity posture (e.g., improve risk management  processes and procedures), and to strengthen its response to potential  cyber threats (e.g., federal cyber incident coordination).
According to Bureau officials, the cost estimate  remains at $15.6 billion, but they are managing the 2020 Census at a  lower level of funding—$14.1 billion and, at this time, do not plan to  request funding for the $1.2 billion contingency fund for unknown  unknowns or $369 million in funding for selected discrete program risks  for what-if scenarios such as an increase in the wage rate or additional  supervisors needed to manage field operations.
Continued  Management  Attention Needed to  Keep Preparations on  Track and Help  Ensure a Cost- Effective Enumeration 2020 Challenges Are  Symptomatic of Deeper  Long-Term Organizational  Issues The difficulties facing the Bureau’s preparation for the decennial census  in such areas as planning and testing; managing and overseeing IT  programs, systems, and contractors supporting the enumeration;  developing reliable cost estimates; prioritizing decisions; managing  schedules; and other challenges, are symptomatic of deeper  organizational issues."
929,"Rotational or preplanned requirements: AFSOC must provide the  reserve component with a request for particular capabilities at least  330 days prior to the mobilization, to allow ANG or AFR officials to  identify the specific individuals who are available to support the  request.
Specifically, we found  AFSOC faces challenges in (1) consistently providing ARC units and  personnel with timely notifications regarding anticipated demand for their  capabilities; (2) coordinating with ANG and AFR commands on potential  requirements for ARC capabilities; and (3) sharing reliable information  about mission requirements and resources with ARC units and personnel.
These officials added that creating a  more robust organizational capacity to manage the involuntary  mobilization of the reserve component could counteract some of the  challenges they have experienced in providing timely notification to ARC  units, directly coordinating with ANG and AFR commands, and identifying  and communicating reliable information about requirements to ARC units.
Additionally, at its current capacity AFSOC will  likely face increasing challenges in providing timely notification to ARC  units, coordinating with ANG and AFR commands, and enhancing  communication with the commands generating requirements to help  solidify mission specifics, as the number of involuntary mobilizations  quadruple by 2021, as estimated by AFSOC officials."
930,"These rules have addressed long tarmac delays, increased compensation  amounts for passengers who are involuntarily denied boarding, and  required certain airlines to post information about their fees and on-time  performance on their websites.
The Rate of Passenger  Complaints Generally  Increased From 2008  Through 2017 While airlines’ operational performance generally improved, we found in  2018 that the number of passenger complaints reported to DOT, relative  to passenger boardings, generally increased from 2008 through 2017 for  12 selected airlines, peaking in 2015 and declining somewhat in later  years."
931,"Each of the Five Task  Forces in Our Review  Has a Counterdrug  Mission, and Its  Activities Vary Based  on Threats in Its Area  of Responsibility and  Available Resources Example of Joint Interagency Task Force– South (JIATF-South) Activity to Combat  Illicit Drug Trafficking   When JIATF-South receives information about  a potential illicit drug smuggling event, it will  use available air and maritime assets  allocated to it to detect and monitor the  suspect smuggling vessel.
According to JIATF-South officials,  data on these events allow JIATF-South to develop its primary measure  to determine the effectiveness of its counterdrug missions and activities:  the percentage of smuggling events JIATF-South detected that it handed  off to law enforcement agencies that resulted in disrupted or seized illicit  drugs.
Although the DHS JTF Coordination Cell and the JTFs developed  performance measures in fiscal year 2018 that better reflect the specific  missions and activities of the three task forces, these measures are  focused on outputs—such as the number of operations conducted in  combating transnational criminal organizations—and not outcomes, such  as the number or percentage of leads that resulted in seizures of illicit  drugs."
932,"Specifically, we found that SBA had (1)  incomplete information and documentation on ANC-owned firms’  compliance with regulatory requirements; (2) limitations in its ability to  track and share key program data needed to enforce revenue rules of  Tribal firms, including ANC-owned firms; (3) insufficient staffing in its  Alaska District Office to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks  of ANC-owned firms; and (4) inadequate program guidance for clearly  communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations."
933,"In our review of 32 cases, we identified DOD contractors  that concealed their ownership information to obtain contracts set aside  for particular types of businesses, to obtain contracts only intended for  domestic companies, and to circumvent debarment by the government.
DOD has also begun to consider  contractor ownership to address national security risks, including  identifying and using contractor ownership information as part of its  supply-chain risk analysis in the procurement of national security systems  and critical components, avoiding contracting with the enemy, and  determining whether contractor facilities can be cleared to access  classified materials.
DOD Has Taken Steps  That Could Address Some  Fraud and Other Risks  Related to Contractor  Ownership DOD and Others Revised the  FAR to Collect Ownership  Information to Improve Their  Review of Contractor Past  Performance before Awarding  New Contracts DOD, GSA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  amended the FAR in May 2014 to require prospective contractors to self- report their immediate and highest-level entity owner, but not their  beneficial owner, as part of contractors’ annual registration process in  SAM.
According to  DOD procurement policy officials, the intent is that the ownership  information would be made available in FAPIIS for contracting officers to  help identify past-performance issues across corporations to aid with  responsibility determinations.
Among the steps included,  DLA requires contracting officials to review contractors’ attestations to  ownership or control by a foreign government to determine whether the  prospective contractor is qualified and eligible to receive an award.
For example, DOD has taken  steps to address national security concerns related to contractor  ownership, including conducting threat assessments to identify risks  related to supply chains for critical components and national security  systems.
DOD procurement policy officials identified that another strategy to  address opaque ownership structures would be to require contractors to  report additional ownership information, such as beneficial-ownership  information, when registering to do business with the federal government  in SAM."
934,"The Navy’s Plan  Identifies Critical  Shipyard  Deficiencies, but  Planning Has Not  Been Completed, and  Implementation Will  Be Complex, Taking  over 20 Years The Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan has identified a number of  infrastructure deficiencies at the Navy’s four public shipyards—including  deficiencies in dry docks, facilities, and capital equipment—that  negatively affect their ability to support the Navy’s current and future force  structure.
Though the Navy intends to recover most of the missed maintenance  periods with these projects, according to Navy officials, the plan was  developed using then-current estimates of fleet size and shipbuilding  schedules derived from the fiscal year 2017 force structure projection.
Planning to Fully Address  Shipyard Facility  Deficiencies Is Ongoing,  with Improvements  Expected to Take at Least  20 Years to Implement It is too soon to determine whether the Navy’s plan will fully address the  shipyards’ facility deficiencies as the Navy has not yet completed the  complex effort necessary to develop detailed facility optimization plans for  each shipyard.
As part of the facility optimization effort, the Navy will seek to address  several critical facility deficiencies it has identified at the public shipyards  that negatively affect the Navy’s ability to complete maintenance on time.
However, it is not clear whether this will fully address shipyard equipment  deficiencies, because the Navy officials stated that they will not be able to  create a more detailed goal until after the facility modeling and simulation  effort is complete.
Navy officials said they plan to develop a more detailed cost estimate  after the Navy has finished creating digital models of the naval shipyards  and identifying their optimized layouts, which they estimate will be in fiscal  year 2021."
935,"Overall, across 21 of the 26  extended-care states for which we analyzed placement data, about 34  percent of youth in foster care who were ages 18 to 21 were placed in  supervised independent living settings in state fiscal year 2017 (see  appendix I for additional information).
Local caseworkers may continue to check in with youth in both single-site  and scattered-site transitional living programs, but private agencies  operating these programs are typically responsible for providing more  frequent case management and supervision, according to officials in the  selected states (see text box).
In response to our survey, 17 states reported that when youth under age  18 are placed in supervised independent living settings, they generally  receive additional supervision or supportive services compared to youth  18 and older.
For example, local and private agency  officials said state child welfare agencies may require parenting youth in  supervised independent living settings to be in larger apartments, which  may be too costly to afford.
Officials in  all five selected states reported offering services that support youth in  extended care in their housing, education, financial literacy, and  employment goals, as well as offering health education, mentoring, and  training on daily living skills (e.g., grocery shopping and budgeting)."
936,"Stakeholders Said  Campus Climate  Surveys Provide  Insights into Campus  Sexual Violence, but  Colleges Face  Challenges  Administering Them Stakeholders we interviewed, including survey developers, other  researchers, and federal, state, and college officials, considered campus  climate surveys a useful tool for learning more about the incidence of  campus sexual violence and identifying areas for improvement to address  it.
Several stakeholders we spoke with also said that campus climate  surveys can provide information on a broader range of sexual violence  incidents than federal crime statistics data, such as the National Crime  Victimization Survey and Clery Act data, which collect information  specifically on criminal offenses.
To improve the quality of  information collected by campus climate  surveys, researchers ask students about  specific behaviors and events that describe  the incident rather than referring to it using a  label such as “sexual assault” or “rape.” campus climate survey instruments we reviewed included questions that  asked for additional context on incidents of sexual violence reported by  students, such as the victim’s relationship to the perpetrator.
Surveys May Help Colleges  Identify Specific Areas for  Improvement Each of the three campus climate surveys we reviewed included  questions regarding student knowledge of the administering college’s  policies and resources related to preventing and responding to sexual  violence on campus.
For example, Justice’s Bureau of  Justice Statistics and Office on Violence Against Women funded the  development of a publicly available survey instrument and a validation  study from 2014 to 2016, to provide colleges and researchers with access  to a free and reliable survey instrument to collect school-level data on  campus climate and sexual victimization."
937,"Fishery  management plans or amendments also include establishing or revising  any allocations between the commercial and recreational sectors for  mixed-use fish stocks where the councils determine it may be  warranted.
Council staff said  the council generally considers establishing allocations when  stakeholders identify issues, or if new information such as a stock  assessment becomes available and indicates that allocations may be  needed to help manage a fish stock.
For example, in a 2016 fishery management plan  amendment, the council considered revising the allocation for king  mackerel because estimates indicated that the recreational sector had not  been landing the amount of fish it was allocated.
To help improve the  availability of such information, NMFS is conducting evaluations that will,  among other things, assess changes in the distribution of fish stocks in  the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic in response to regional climate  change impacts.
Moreover, the regional operating  agreements are not intended to limit or prevent the councils’ use of  additional processes in response to specific management needs,  according to these documents and the operational guidelines, and the  Gulf of Mexico council has taken initial steps in developing an allocation  review process as previously described.
(Recommendation 1) The NMFS Assistant Administrator for Fisheries should work with the  South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico councils, and other councils as  appropriate, to specify how the councils will document their allocation  reviews, including the basis for their allocation decisions, whether fishery  management plan objectives are being met, and what factors were  considered in the reviews."
938,"CMS officials said that having more years of CMS-416 data helps  identify trends in the provision of EPSDT services over a longer period of  time than possible with the Child Core Set. On the other hand, CMS  officials said it is difficult to compare states’ performance using the CMS- 416, because some performance measures are based on periodicity  schedules, which vary state-to-state and over time.
III for the percentage of beneficiaries aged 1 to 20 that received  preventive dental services in each state and nationally from fiscal years  2011 through 2017.) Available data on blood lead screenings in the CMS-416 are incomplete  and, as a result, do not provide information necessary to determine how  many beneficiaries received the screenings.
(Recommendation 5) The Administrator of CMS should develop a plan with time frames and  interim milestones for using T-MSIS data to generate the necessary  data from the Child Core Set to improve EPSDT oversight and  streamline state reporting.
HHS concurred with our first recommendation that CMS should work with  states and relevant federal agencies to collect accurate and complete  data on blood lead screening for Medicaid beneficiaries and assist states  with planning improvements to resolve gaps in states’ performance as  needed."
939,"To develop an employment plan, the  counselor and veteran review labor market information for jobs within the  veteran’s identified abilities, aptitudes, and interests that will not  aggravate his or her service-connected disability or disabilities.
Counselors in Our Review  Stated They Strive to  Develop Individualized  Plans but Acknowledged  That Some Unintended  Differences in Plans for  Similarly-Situated  Veterans Likely Occurs Counselors we interviewed described how veterans’ employment plans  are individually designed to suit a veteran’s needs and, as a result, may  differ from one another even when veterans have similar goals,  characteristics, and circumstances."
940,"For  the purposes of this report, we refer to these requirements collectively as  the “ESSA educational stability provisions.” Specifically, SEAs are required to describe in their Title I state plans the  steps they will take to ensure collaboration with the state child welfare  agency to ensure the educational stability of children in foster care,  including assurances that: Such children enroll or remain in their school of origin, unless a  determination is made that it is not in the child’s best interest to attend  the school of origin.
Specifically,  officials reported challenges with (1) turnover among local child welfare  and educational agency staff, (2) obtaining school district input during the  process for determining whether it is in a youth’s best interest to remain in  their school of origin (referred to as best interest determinations), (3)  providing and funding transportation, (4) ensuring accurate identification  of youth in foster care, and (5) monitoring how school districts implement  these provisions.
Specifically: Thirty-two SEA survey respondents identified maintaining an accurate  list of school district foster care points of contact for their state as  challenging, and officials from four state and local educational and  child welfare agencies we spoke with stated turnover makes it difficult  to keep these lists updated.
To alleviate challenges related to turnover, SEA points of contact we  surveyed and interviewed explained that they regularly provide  information to local school district and child welfare agency officials on the  ESSA educational stability provisions.
In addition, most SEAs  reported on our survey that they work with their state child welfare  agencies to provide or develop assistance, guidance, and sample  documents or templates to facilitate implementation of the ESSA  educational stability provisions at the local level."

942,"Federal and State  Agencies Identified  Several Hundred  Thousand Abandoned  Hardrock Mine  Features, Over  100,000 of Which  May Be Hazardous As of May 2019, the Forest Service, BLM, the Park Service, and EPA  together identified in their databases at least 140,652 abandoned  hardrock mine features—of which over 60 percent are known to pose or  may pose physical safety or environmental hazards.
Federal Agencies  Identified At Least 140,652  Abandoned Mine  Features, about 89,000 of  Which Pose or May Pose  Physical Safety or  Environmental Hazards The Forest Service, BLM, the Park Service, and EPA identified in their  databases at least 140,652 abandoned hardrock mine features, as of  May 2019.
Figure 2 depicts federal agency  information about the numbers of confirmed and unconfirmed physical  safety and environmental hazards on the lands under these agencies’  jurisdictions, in relation to the total estimated abandoned hardrock mine  features, as of May 2019.
Forest Service, BLM, and Park Service officials we interviewed said they  conducted most of their work to address physical safety and  environmental hazards at abandoned hardrock mines in collaboration with  state agencies, nonfederal stakeholders, and other federal agencies,  including EPA.
Federal Agencies  Estimated Billions More  Would Be Needed to  Address Abandoned  Hardrock Mine Hazards The Forest Service, BLM, the Park Service, and EPA estimated that their  future costs to inventory and address physical safety and environmental  hazards at abandoned hardrock mines would be in the billions of  dollars.
Park Service officials said they estimated that it  would cost about $86 million to address the physical safety hazards at the  abandoned hardrock mines identified in the agency’s database.
In addition, state agency  officials and other stakeholders we interviewed, such as nongovernmental  organizations and mining companies, have limited their participation in  projects to address environmental hazards at abandoned mines because  of concerns about their potential legal liability under CERCLA and the  Clean Water Act. All of the officials we interviewed from the Forest Service, BLM, the Park  Service, and EPA, as well as from Colorado, Montana, and Nevada, cited  availability of resources as a factor that limits their efforts to identify and  address the physical safety and environmental hazards at abandoned  hardrock mines."
943,"For example, foreign  central banks value the ability to buy and sell large quantities of securities  to assist in managing their exchange rates and, in times of economic  stress, provide foreign currency credit to their country’s businesses that  borrow or trade in U.S. dollars.
(For more information on the survey results, see  appendix II.) “An increase in global risk (political or  economic) will determine flight to quality and  higher allocation to Treasuries.” Many investors are willing to accept a lower yield on Treasury securities  in exchange for the liquidity, depth, and safety they provide.
Changes in U.S. Monetary  Policy Operations,  Financial Regulation, and  Foreign Central Bank  Needs Have Affected the  Composition of Demand While a broad and diverse investor base helps promote stability for the  Treasury market as a whole, demand for Treasury securities by different  types of investors fluctuates over time, reflecting changes in the  investment needs of particular sectors.
Market participants we interviewed and surveyed across  various sectors have raised concerns about risks that could affect  demand for Treasury securities: risks from a future debt limit impasse, the  sustainability of the federal debt, the dollar’s status as the primary reserve  currency, and changes in the structure of the market which might affect  liquidity, all of which could degrade the unique advantages of the  Treasury market.
We therefore are forced to invest  in other forms of liquid securities, or to modify  our participation in T-bills to avoid key dates  around debt limits.” Overall, 48 of the 67 (72 percent) investors we surveyed reported that  they anticipated they would take similar action—such as avoiding  purchases of securities that would mature around the affected dates and  requiring higher yields for purchasing those securities—to manage  potential market disruptions caused by any future debt limit impasses.
At the same time that the number of principal trading firms increased,  market participants we surveyed and interviewed told us that broker- dealers are holding a smaller inventory of Treasury securities, which they  attributed to certain post-crisis financial reforms that increased the cost of  holding a large inventory of securities, including Treasury securities, for  broker-dealers that are part of the larger banking institutions.
Market Outreach and  Analysis Inform  Treasury Debt  Issuance Decisions  but Policies  Governing Key Inputs  Could Be  Strengthened Treasury must regularly make important debt issuance decisions—such  as what type of Treasury security to issue and in what quantities—to  maintain broad-based demand and support its goal of borrowing at the  lowest cost over time."
944,"The Energy Policy Act, as amended, authorizes the D&D Fund to pay for  the costs of all D&D and remediation activities at the GDPs. Specifically,  according to EM officials, the D&D Fund is used to pay for the following  cleanup activities: (1) D&D of inactive facilities either by cleaning up the  facilities so they could be reused or by demolishing them; (2) remedial  actions such as assessing and treating groundwater or soil  contamination; (3) waste management, such as the transport and  disposal of hazardous waste; (4) the surveillance and maintenance of the  GDPs, such as general repairs to keep the buildings and facilities in a  safe condition; (5) uranium and thorium licensee reimbursements; (6) training for contractor personnel who work on D&D activities; and (7)  other activities, such as legal costs associated with the GDPs, funding to  support site-specific advisory boards at Portsmouth and Paducah, and  pension costs of workers involved in uranium enrichment or D&D.
Other Funding Sources  Used for Cleanup According to EM officials, there are additional cleanup-related activities  taking place at the GDPs that are not covered by the D&D Fund, which  include: (1) security—which provides services to protect nuclear  materials, sensitive uranium enrichment technology, equipment, and  facilities; (2) operation of the onsite waste disposal facility at Oak Ridge;  and (3) conversion of depleted uranium hexafluoride—a byproduct of the  enrichment process—into a more stable form, such as uranium oxide,  that will require eventual disposal (see sidebar).
EM Has Managed  Cleanup of the GDPs as  Three Individual Sites The Energy Policy Act, as amended, establishes a single, shared D&D  Fund to pay for the D&D costs of the GDP sites, such that EM must  coordinate and make trade-offs in its use of limited resources among the  three GDPs. In addition, since 2007, DOE has stated in its triennial  reports to Congress that its intent is to manage the GDPs in an integrated  manner.
EM officials told us that the agency’s corporate database—the  Integrated Planning, Accountability, and Budgeting System (IPABS)— contains the integrated master schedule for all of EM’s cleanup work,  including the GDPs. The purpose of IPABS is to provide information  on (1) changes to the life-cycle scope, cost, and schedule and (2)  performance data such as earned value, performance metrics, and  cleanup milestones.
In addition, in  March 2019, EM officials said that all facilities at the Oak Ridge GDP  will be demolished by fiscal year 2020 and remediation activities will  be completed by fiscal year 2024, stating that the fiscal year 2022  date in the 2019 triennial report is based on outdated data.
EPA and  Tennessee regulators also told us they do not believe that EM’s  current estimated completion date is realistic for the Oak Ridge GDP  cleanup based on their understanding of the scope of remaining work,  particularly cleanup of groundwater contamination.
EM’s Past  Expenditure Data Are  Limited, and Its  Future Cost  Estimates Are  Unreliable EM reported it has spent at least $15.5 billion on GDP cleanup as of  2018, including approximately $5.1 billion on the Oak Ridge cleanup,  approximately $6.7 billion on the Portsmouth cleanup, and approximately  $3.7 billion on the Paducah cleanup.
Because both the Oak Ridge and Paducah GDPs are included  on EPA’s National Priorities List, both sites are required to have a Federal  Facility Agreement—an agreement that guides the cleanup process and  establishes cleanup priorities and schedules with enforceable milestones  as agreed to by EM, EPA, and state regulators.
Moreover, EM  does not have reliable cost estimates for completing cleanup of the three  GDPs. Until EM ensures the site-specific life-cycle cost estimates for the  cleanup of each of the GDPs fully incorporate best practices for cost  estimation, EM, DOE, regulators, and Congress will not have the  information needed to understand the level of resources required to  achieve cleanup of the GDPs. According to EPA and state regulatory officials from Kentucky and  Tennessee, negotiations with EM regarding various cleanup decisions  have strained relations between EM and regulators and present  challenges to the GDP cleanup progress that will likely cause further  delays and increase GDP cleanup costs if EM is unable to reach  agreement on its preferred outcomes."
945,"Specifically, MDA has improved reporting in its  annual progress reports to the Congress and made advances across a  broad range of management activities, including the involvement of  stakeholders, reducing concurrency, and continued efforts to improve key  aspects of testing necessary to demonstrate delivered capability.
To increase insight into MDA’s management of the BMDS,  MDA implemented significant changes to its key acquisition processes  and for the first time developed and reported detailed baselines for  each element in the BAR in 2010.

946,"NNSA Completed  Many of Its Planned  Nuclear Security  Efforts in Russia, and  Had Concerns about  the Sustainability of  These Efforts When  Cooperation Ended Based on our review of available NNSA documentation and interviews  with project team personnel, we found that NNSA had completed many— but not all—site-level MPC&A projects at the 25 Russian nuclear material  sites when cooperation ended in 2014.
However, at the time cooperation ended,  NNSA still had a number of concerns about both the sustainability of  nuclear security efforts at the 25 sites and the state of Russia’s national- level nuclear material security infrastructure.
We also found in our review of these assessments that NNSA had  continuing concerns when cooperation ended about both the  sustainability of MPC&A upgrades at individual Russian sites and the  state of the national-level nuclear material security infrastructure in  Russia.
Based on  our documentation review and interviews with project team members, we  identified the six most common areas of concerns, including: (1) the  responsiveness of protective forces, (2) performance testing the  effectiveness of MPC&A systems, (3) sustainment funding, (4) physical  protection systems, (5) nuclear security culture, and (6) access and  cooperation at Russian sites."
947,"Among other things, the plan required a  description of the existing financial management structure and changes  needed; a strategy for developing adequate, consistent, and timely  financial information; proposals for eliminating unneeded systems;  identification of workforce needs and actions to ensure that those needs  are met; a plan for the audit of financial statements of executive branch  agencies; and an estimate of the costs for implementing the plan.
According to the survey we issued to CFOs and deputy  CFOs, some of these improvements include advising executive  leadership on financial management matters and direction for agency  financial operations and professional financial management personnel;  taking steps to develop and maintain financial management systems;  reducing duplicative financial management systems; resolving audit  findings; supporting audits of the agency’s financial statements; helping to  ensure the quality of financial information, and preparing the agency  financial report and other financial reports.
Agencies have significantly improved the quality and timeliness of their  financial reporting since the enactment of the CFO Act. As expanded by  the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA) and the  Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 (ATDA), federal law now  requires every CFO Act agency and most other executive agencies to  annually prepare audited financial statements no later than March 1—5  months after the end of the federal fiscal year.
Substantial benefits have been achieved as a result of the preparation  and audit of financial statements, which provide useful and necessary  insight into government operations, including  federal agency accountability to Congress and citizens, including  independent assurance about the reliability of reported financial  information; greater confidence to stakeholders (governance officials, taxpayers,  consumers, or regulated entities) that federal funds are being properly  accounted for and assets are properly safeguarded; an assessment of the reliability and effectiveness of systems and  related internal controls, including identifying control deficiencies that  could lead to fraud, waste, and abuse; a focus on information security; early warnings of emerging financial management issues; and  identification of noncompliance with laws and regulations, which can  present challenges to agency operations.
Examples of potential metrics include the  number of internal control deficiencies, the number of internal control  deficiencies corrected during the year, and the number of  Antideficiency Act violations.The metrics should be included in the  government-wide and agency-level financial management plans  discussed above and agencies’ performance against the metrics  reported in the annual status reports.
Rectify Internal Control  Issues in Certain Areas The CFO Act required CFOs to develop and maintain an integrated  agency accounting and financial management system that provides for  complete, reliable, consistent, and timely information prepared on a  uniform basis and that responds to agency management’s financial  information needs."
948,"For example, according to many Corps headquarters,  division, and district officials, the WRRDA 2014 provision to develop a  coordinated environmental review process is generally consistent with  NEPA and its implementing regulations.
Corps headquarters officials said that while  they have not created the database required by WRRDA 2014, relevant  information is available through the agency’s annual public reports on  active and recently completed feasibility studies’ milestones and  schedules.
In addition to monitoring individual feasibility studies, Corps headquarters  officials said they have conducted some broader reviews of how the  acceleration reforms are progressing.
Similarly, several Corps headquarters, district, and division  officials have commended the agency’s new approach to risk  management and stated that they aim to provide partner agencies  with the information they need to conduct their work on the feasibility  study.
Corps headquarters officials said agency policy requires district officials  conducting feasibility studies to enter data on 10 key milestones for each  study into the agency’s central data system."

950,"Since CBP’s operations depend heavily on the condition and functionality of  infrastructure at land border crossings, GSA works closely with OFAM to  plan, design, construct, and implement capital infrastructure  improvements to accommodate ever-growing trade and travel at land  border crossings.
In general,  CBP’s inspection process at land border crossings follows a standard  sequence that includes separate areas designated for preprimary  inspection, primary inspection, and secondary inspection for each mode  of traffic and a main building which houses administrative and operational  support activities, which we describe below.
Outbound  infrastructure in the passenger vehicle, bus, commercial, and pedestrian  area typically consists of one or more exit lanes and may also include  inspection booths, inspection technologies, a secondary inspection area  and support facilities, among others, to process traffic leaving the United  States.
At GSA-owned land border crossings, CBP typically works with GSA to  complete a feasibility study and uses this information to prioritize  infrastructure projects.
More specifically, separate from CBP’s process for  assessing facility condition, GSA uses its Building Assessment Tool to  assess the condition of infrastructure across its entire real property  portfolio, including land border crossings.
Further, as described earlier, by conducting FCAs for each  CBP-owned land border crossing every three years, updating them  annually consistent with DHS Directive 119-02-004, and then entering  the results into TRIRIGA in accordance with the new guidelines for  reviewing existing infrastructure needs and removing them as needed,  CBP would be positioned to more frequently review and validate these  data in the system on an ongoing basis.
CBP officials stated they have not yet determined  which data they will use to develop this report, but this reporting  requirement is one potential example of how more reliable data from  TRIRIGA could be used to effectively report on the condition of land  border crossing infrastructure.
Establishing and documenting a methodology for CBP’s annual land  border crossing capital prioritization process, including procedures and  time frames for each step, could help ensure that CBP identifies key  activities needed to prioritize projects and that CBP personnel follow a  consistent methodology across projects and across years.
CBP-requested changes led to cost and/or  schedule growth at the Calexico West, Columbus, Derby Line, Nogales  West-Mariposa, and San Ysidro land border crossing projects, according  to GSA officials.
Additionally, while CBP develops five-year plans to prioritize capital  projects at land border crossings, establishing time frames for  stakeholders who review and approve the plans would better position  CBP to identify and address sources of delay and could improve its ability  to complete a plan each year and include it in the budget submission to  Congress.
Table 6  identifies land border crossings by name, state, ownership, year  constructed, the year last renovated, facility condition index score, and  the cost of known infrastructure deficiencies, according to CBP data, and  is for informational purposes only."

953,"For example, some airport operators use  sophisticated technologies such as fingerprint readers to control access  to security-restricted areas, or offer or require training for aviation workers  about topics such as insider threats.
Figure 2 provides examples of the variety of security procedures and  technologies used by TSA, airport operators, and air carriers at typical  category X or I airports to control access to security-restricted areas of  airports and help mitigate insider threats.
TSA issues guidance and policies that, among other things, require airport operators and air carriers to implement or enhance access controls or other security measures, or share best practices on improving security and mitigating insider threats.
TSA issued information circulars in 2018 and 2019 that (1) recommended that airport operators and air carriers with exclusive area agreements conduct a vulnerability assessment of insider risks and develop a risk mitigation plan, and included best practices for the mitigation plan, and (2) described measures to prevent unauthorized access to aircraft and the flight deck.
Some examples of voluntary efforts airport operators  have reported implementing to help mitigate insider threats include  physical screening of aviation workers at access points to SIDAs or  secured areas in addition to TSA’s random screening under the ATLAS  program, using sophisticated access control technologies such as  biometric fingerprint readers, and offering or requiring training for aviation  workers on additional security awareness topics."
954,"To inform the management agreement and the agency baseline  commitment, each program and project with a life-cycle cost estimated to  be greater than $250 million must also develop a joint cost and schedule  confidence level (JCL).
Key Elements of NASA’s  Planned Return to the  Moon NASA has initiated multiple programs to help the agency achieve its  Artemis III mission and longer-term lunar exploration goals.
NASA officials told us that they did not start with these higher-level  architecture and all of the requirements documents because they thought  it was important to first establish requirements for individual programs and  review what contractors proposed for Gateway and the Human Landing  System, and incorporate industry input on what requirements are feasible.
Further, NASA senior leadership made a decision  that resulted in limiting information regarding the probability of the  Gateway program meeting cost and schedule estimates to support the  2024 lunar landing.

956,"VA Has Not Provided  Complete Information  on Four Elements in  the Act In our March 2018 report, we found that VA’s November 2017 plan for  implementing a new disability appeals process while attending to appeals  under way in the current (legacy) process, addressed 17 of 22 elements  required by the Act. For the 5 remaining elements, we found that it  partially addressed 4 elements related to implementation monitoring,  productivity projecting, and workforce planning, and did not address 1  element related to identifying total resources.
To address these gaps, we recommended that VA clearly articulate in its  appeals plan how VA will monitor and assess the new appeals process  compared to the legacy process, including specifying a balanced set of  goals and measures—such as timeliness goals for all VBA appeals  options and Board dockets, and measures of accuracy, veteran  satisfaction, and cost—and related baseline data.
We reviewed VA’s integrated master schedule (IMS) for the appeals  reform effort and underlying sub-schedules to assess them against 6 of  the 10 best practices, which we determined most relevant to our March  2018 recommendation that VA augment its master schedule for VA’s  appeals plan to reflect all activities—such as modifications to information  technology  systems—as well as assigned responsibilities,  interdependencies, start and end dates for key activities for each  workgroup, and resources, to establish accountability and reduce the  overall risk of implementation failures."
957,"Specifically, the act requires DHS,  in consultation with OMB, to administer the implementation of agency  information security policies and practices for non-national security  information systems by: (1) assisting OMB with carrying out its oversight  responsibilities; (2) developing, issuing, and overseeing implementation of  binding operational directives; and (3) providing operational and technical  assistance.
Specifically, information security evaluation  reports that we and agency inspectors general issued during fiscal year  2018 showed that most of the 16 selected agencies did not consistently  or effectively implement policies or practices related to the core security  functions of the cybersecurity framework.
Most of the 16 Selected  Agencies Exhibited  Deficiencies in All  Cybersecurity Framework  Core Security Functions FISMA requires agencies and their inspectors general to report on the  adequacy and effectiveness of information security policies, procedures,  and practices.
To facilitate meeting this reporting requirement, CIGIE, in  collaboration with OMB and DHS, developed metrics that agency  inspectors general are to use to report on eight security domains that  align with the five core security functions—Identify, Protect, Detect,  Respond, and Recover—of the NIST cybersecurity framework.
NIST guidance specifies activities that agencies  should implement to effectively identify and manage cybersecurity risks,  including: establishing a risk management strategy that includes a determination  identifying assets that require protection; assessing risk; and documenting plans of action and milestones (POA&Ms) to mitigate  known deficiencies.
FISMA requires agencies to develop, document, and  implement an agency-wide information security program that includes  periodic testing and evaluation of effectiveness and procedures for  detecting security incidents.
In  addition, OMB’s guidance to agencies for preparing their fiscal year 2018  FISMA report does not sufficiently address FISMA’s requirement for  developing subordinate plans for providing adequate information security  for networks, facilities, and information systems.
OMB Assessed and Reported  on Agencies’ Implementation  of Federal Information Security  Requirements, but the Number  of Agencies Scheduled to  Participate in CyberStat  Meetings Has Declined over  the Last 3 Years In addition to developing and monitoring the implementation of  information security policies, FISMA directs OMB to oversee agencies’  compliance with the act’s requirements to provide information security  protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm  resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or  destruction of information or information systems."

The Navy Has Not Put  Key Processes and  Assessments in Place to  Evaluate the Effectiveness  of Changes to SWO  Training While the planned skill checks are designed to help ensure that SWOs  have the skills required to perform their duties, senior Navy officials stated  that it could take 16 years or more to know if the planned changes to  SWO training were effective in increasing Commanding Officer ship- driving proficiency across the fleet.
Specifically  and described in detail below, in planning an approach for evaluating its  efforts, the Navy has not (1) solicited fleet-wide feedback on the quality of  the increased ship-driving training, (2) planned to routinely conduct ship- driving competency assessments, (3) provided standard criteria for  qualifying Officer of the Deck candidates, and (4) determined how to  analyze and use information from logbooks that SWOs are required to  complete.
(Recommendation 1) We recommend that the Secretary of the Navy ensure that the  Commander, Naval Surface Forces, routinely conduct regular Officer of  the Deck competency assessments using samples of sufficient size and  using selection methods to gauge the level of fleet-wide ship-driving  proficiency trends following the implementation of the planned ship- driving training programs.

961,"We recommended, among other things,  that DOD streamline its report to Congress to focus on key project  performance metrics and to provide guidance to the military departments  to ensure the consistent collection and reporting of housing satisfaction  information from all servicemembers.
DOD Conducts Some  Oversight of the  Condition of  Privatized Housing,  but Efforts Are Limited  in Key Areas OSD and each of the military departments conduct a range of activities to  oversee both the condition of privatized housing and performance of the  private partners and have recently implemented initiatives to improve this  oversight—such as increasing the frequency of the physical inspection of  homes and issuing guidance to ensure consistency in the framework  used to measure project performance.
Specifically, our review showed (1) the  scope of oversight of the physical condition of privatized housing has  been limited; (2) performance metrics focused on quality of maintenance  and resident satisfaction may not accurately reflect private partner  performance related to the condition of privatized housing; (3) there is a  lack of reliable or consistent data on the condition of privatized housing;  and (4) past DOD reports to Congress on resident satisfaction are  unreliable due to the inconsistent handling and calculation of the data and  therefore may be misleading.
Military housing officials told  us that activities to monitor the physical condition of housing units  generally include reviewing sample work order requests, following up with  a sample of residents to check on their experience with recently  completed work, and inspecting homes during the change-of-occupancy  process.
In addition to the  compliance reviews, guidance states that Air Force Civil Engineer  Center officials visit projects annually, and officials told us that they  tour a sample of homes and interview private partner representatives,  military housing office staff, and residents during these visits.
Military department officials told us that efforts are underway to monitor  work order data from the private partners’ work order tracking systems in  an effort to increase the military departments’ oversight and accountability  of the private partners for providing quality housing to servicemembers.
The statute also states that DOD’s reports to  Congress shall include additional information, such as the results of  residence surveys, as well as assessments of maintenance response  times, completion of maintenance requests, the dispute resolution  process, overall customer service for tenants, and other factors related to  the condition of privatized housing.
For example, each military  department has guidance that establishes the role of its housing offices in  the resident dispute resolution process—specifically, if servicemembers  are experiencing a dispute with the private partner: Army policy states that each installation should have an official tasked  with providing support to servicemembers regarding resident issues  that cannot be resolved by the private property manager.
By improving oversight guidance, mechanisms for  measuring private partner performance, the reliability of housing data,  and reporting on resident satisfaction, DOD can better ensure that MHPI  is providing servicemembers with quality housing.
(Recommendation 4) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment, in collaboration with the military departments  and private housing partners, establish minimum data requirements and  consistent terminology and practices for work order data collection for  comparability across installations and projects and to track trends over  time."
962,"(See fig.1.) Before awarding a contract in excess of the simplified acquisition  threshold (generally $150,000 at the time of our review), the FAR requires  contracting officials to review information in the Federal Awardee  Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), which can  include descriptions of a prospective contractor’s past safety and health  violations.
After completing an inspection, if OSHA or state compliance officers  determine that the employer has violated any safety or health standards,  they may issue a citation, including a deadline for correcting the hazards,  and related financial penalties (see fig.
Without exploring  the feasibility of requiring a corporate identification number in OSHA’s  inspection database and enabling OSHA’s website to be searched by that  number, contracting officials and other interested parties are likely to  experience challenges obtaining accurate information about companies’  safety and health violations.
As a result, information on safety performance is  summarized in a single location within CPARS, and thus, readily  accessible to federal contracting officials, including those at DOD, when a  previous USACE construction contractor is considered for future contract  awards.
To describe the incidence of prior serious safety or health violations  among selected companies with DOD manufacturing and construction  contracts, we matched federal contracting data to the Department of  Labor’s (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  inspection data for selected contractors, interviewed OSHA officials, and  reviewed relevant OSHA policy."
963,"The report directed the DOD Principal Cyber  Advisor, the Commander, CYBERCOM, and the service secretaries to  develop a plan for the military services to complete all required training for  the second wave of CMF teams and to maintain individual training  capabilities for the existing teams.
For example, neither the Army nor the Air  Force plan identifies the number (average or total) of personnel for each  of the work roles described in figure 2 (for example, cyber operators,  intelligence analysts, linguists) that the military services need to complete  phase two foundational training courses to maintain the appropriate sizing  and deployment of personnel across CMF teams.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of the Army should ensure that Army Cyber Command  coordinate with CYBERCOM to develop a plan that comprehensively  assesses and identifies specific CMF training requirements for phases  two (foundational), three (collective), and four (sustainment), in order to  maintain the appropriate sizing and deployment of personnel across the  Army’s CMF teams.
(Recommendation 3) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that Fleet Cyber Command  coordinate with CYBERCOM to develop a plan that comprehensively  assesses and identifies specific CMF training requirements for phases  three (collective) and four (sustainment) in order to maintain the  appropriate sizing and deployment of personnel across the Navy’s CMF  teams."

966,"Background F-35 Program The F-35 Lighting II program is a joint, multinational acquisition program  intended to develop and field a family of next-generation strike fighter  aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps (hereinafter  referred to as the services); seven international partners; and four foreign  military sales customers (collectively hereinafter referred to as program  participants).
Users at 2 Air  Force locations stated that until the Air Force can train more military  personnel to support ALIS-related issues, they will need to increase the  number of contractor employees per squadron to support F-35  operations.
Officials from another location reported that during a 6-month  period they had to ground aircraft for 2,200 hours as a result of waiting for  contractors to resolve parts-related ARs. Users from a third location  stated that more transparency in the AR process could reduce reliance on  contractor support, provide a way to address F-35 problems more  efficiently, and reduce costs to the program since DOD incurs a fee each  time an AR is submitted.
In September 2014, we recommended that DOD develop a performance- measurement process for ALIS that includes, but is not limited to,  performance metrics and targets that (1) are based on the intended  behavior of the system in actual operations and (2) tie system  performance to user requirements.
However, users and  program officials stated that recurring issues with ALIS could also be  affecting aircraft performance and noted that data on these issues are not  being collected by the contractor or DOD.
According to Joint Strike  Fighter Integrated Test Force officials, previous DOD aircraft logistics  systems were much simpler, not fully autonomic, and generally included  data related to fewer major capabilities.
DOD  contracting officials and prime contractor representatives stated that the  need to balance a limited number of software development personnel  between efforts to stabilize the current system and add new features has  negatively affected the development of ALIS.
In a 2017 report, the Air  Force Digital Service recommended that the F-35 program office cease  adding new capabilities in order to re-evaluate ALIS-related design  choices and improve software development processes and procedures.
For example, DOD  officials said they have faced challenges obtaining key technical data  from the prime contractor that would be required by DOD to lead ALIS  software development, such as the underlying source code for current  ALIS software, and that they were uncertain about the extent to which  they would be able to obtain these data in the future.
Appendix I: Scope and Methodology For each of our objectives, we reviewed relevant F-35 sustainment and  the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)-related data, plans,  program briefs, guidance, and other documentation and collected  information by interviewing officials from the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the F-35 Joint Program  Office, the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, the Defense  Contract Management Agency, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the  U.S. Marine Corps, the Air Force Digital Service, and the prime  contractor, Lockheed Martin."
967,"Jurisdictions’ Emergency  Management Capability  Assessments To help jurisdictions more comprehensively assess their gaps, FEMA  required they complete the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk  Assessment (THIRA) and Stakeholders Preparedness Review (SPR).
In 2019, FEMA established the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness  Grant Program to help jurisdictions address known capability gaps in  disaster housing as well as logistics and supply chain management.
We reported in March 2011 that FEMA needed to  improve its oversight of preparedness grants by establishing a framework  with measurable performance objectives for assessing urban area, state,  territory, and tribal capabilities to identify gaps and prioritize  investments.
For example, determining what steps need to  be taken, following the issuance of the 2020 National Preparedness  Report, could help FEMA inform key decision makers, such as Congress  and the Office of Management and Budget, about the necessary level of  resources—including the allocation of resources—that are needed to  address the nation’s capability gaps.
According  to FEMA, the agency is implementing recommendations to address the  challenges outlined in the after-action report, which include the following  focus areas:  scaling and staffing for concurrent complex incidents;  improving logistics capabilities during response;  improving response to long-term infrastructure outages; and,  improving mass care to initial disaster housing operations based on  innovations developed during the 2017 hurricane season.
According to DHS, this recommendation is consistent with the  requirements outlined in the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018  (DRRA) noting that FEMA complete a national preparedness assessment  of capability gaps at each level based on tiered, capability-specific  performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding; and  identify the potential costs for establishing and maintaining those  capabilities at each level and determine what capabilities federal  agencies should provide."
968,"Officials from the relevant DOE site and program offices, along with  officials from DOE’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Office of  Management, and General Counsel at DOE headquarters, evaluate the  application based on several criteria, such as: (1) the property must have  been subject to taxation by local or state authorities immediately prior to  being acquired by the federal government, (2) payments must not be  retroactive, (3) payments should not be in excess of the taxes that would  have been collected if the property had remained on the local tax rolls in  the condition in which it was acquired, and (4) property values will be  based on the highest and best use of the property based on the  classification of the property when it was acquired.
Of the approximately 680,000 acres of property at the 30 sites that are  eligible or potentially eligible for PILT, about 25 percent is located at the  18 sites where the communities did not receive PILT payments, according  to fiscal year 2017 data provided by DOE.
Although the order does not require payments to  reflect the revenues communities would have received, it states that, on a  case-by-case basis, PILT payments will be based on the same  assessment values and tax rates that the communities apply to  comparable properties with the same use and/or tax classification.
DOE’s PILT Order Establishes  DOE Site Office Administration  of Payments but Lacks  Requirement for Independent  Review of PILT Invoices DOE’s PILT order states that “DOE plans to evaluate applications for  PILT, and to calculate” PILT payments using specific guidelines based on  key determinants, such as the description of the property, tax rates and  assessment values for comparable property, use and zoning classification  of the property, and deductions equivalent to certain federal payments;  however, it does not call for a review process to determine whether  calculations used for PILT invoices follow those guidelines.
Based on  our reviews of PILT documentation and interviews with DOE officials, we  identified cases in which payments did not appear to meet the stated  PILT goal of compensating communities for the revenue they would have  received if the property had remained on the tax rolls.
If DOE’s PILT  order had included more specificity about how tax relief programs  should be addressed, DOE might have had greater assurance that  these payments were not higher than the revenue the communities  would have received had the property remained on the tax rolls in the  condition in which it was acquired."

971,"There are 21 depots operated by the military services that  are subject to the 6 percent minimum investment requirement (the “6  percent rule”)—four are Naval Shipyards, three are Navy Fleet Readiness  Centers, two are Marine Corps Production Plants, three are Air Force Air  Logistics Complexes, and nine are Army Depots and Arsenals.
DOD’s Approach for  Guiding Depot  Investments Lacks  Key Elements  Important to  Addressing the  Depots’ Challenges  Efficiently and  Effectively The military services are developing optimization plans for their depots,  but these plans lack analytically-based goals, results-oriented metrics, a  full accounting of the resources, risks, and stakeholders, and a process  for reporting on progress.
In June 2018 Congress directed the Secretaries of  the Army, Navy and Air Force to submit an engineering master plan for  optimal placement and consolidation of facilities and major equipment, as  well as an investment strategy addressing the facilities, major equipment  and infrastructure requirements of depots under the jurisdiction of each  service.
However, based on our discussions with officials from all four services,  the depot plans for the Army and Marine Corps depots and arsenals, the  Navy Fleet Readiness Centers, and the Air Force Air Logistics  Complexes currently under development will lack certain key elements  identified in our prior work, including: Analytically-based goals.
For example, we reported in 2017 that even though the  Navy had developed capital investment plans in 2013 and 2015 intended  to help improve the state of the facilities and equipment at the shipyards,  backlogged restoration and maintenance projects had grown by 41  percent over 5 years which extended the amount of time required to clear  the backlog under expected funding levels.
In  addition, implementing a regular monitoring and reporting process to  provide oversight and accountability over depot investments would further  enhance DOD’s ability to attain improvements at the depots significant  enough to reverse years of decline and reach the challenging goals set by  the Secretary of Defense for improving mission capability rates and  reducing operating and support costs.
(Recommendation 2) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that Naval Sea Systems  Command and the Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers establish  measures for their depots to track facility or equipment conditions that  lead to maintenance delays.
(Recommendation 9) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that Commander, Fleet  Readiness Centers incorporates in its depot optimization plan, key  results-oriented elements including analytically-based goals, results- oriented metrics, identification of required resources, risks, and  stakeholders, and regular reporting to decision makers on progress."

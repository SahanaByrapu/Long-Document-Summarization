0,"Introduction On January 5, 2011, the House of Representatives adopted an amendment to House Rule XII to require that Members of the House state the constitutional basis for Congress's power to enact the proposed legislation when introducing a bill or joint resolution.
The report concludes by discussing trends with regard to the House's recent CAS practices and by providing considerations for congressional personnel drafting CASs. The report contains two tables: Table 1 identifies the constitutional provisions most commonly cited in CASs during the last six months of the 114 th and 115 th Congresses, and Table 2 lists suggested constitutional authorities for various types of legislation.
Specifically, that clause provides Congress with the power to make ""all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof."" The Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of Congress's power under the Necessary and Proper Clause as ""broad,"" in that the clause leaves to ""Congress a large discretion as to the means that may be employed in executing a given power."" In so holding, the Court has described the clause as providing the ""broad power to enact laws that are 'convenient, or useful' or 'conducive' to"" a more specific authority's ""beneficial exercise."" Consistent with this view, the Court has upheld legislation criminalizing perjury and witness tampering as an extension of Congress's power to constitute federal tribunals.
For instance, the Supreme Court has identified federalism-based constraints stemming from the Tenth Amendment—the provision of the Bill of Rights that reads, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."" More specifically, the Court has interpreted the Tenth Amendment to prevent the federal government from ""commandeering"" or requiring state executive officers or state legislators to carry out federal directives.
Among the most prominent examples of CASs that could be seen as adopting an interpretation of the Constitution that potentially diverges from historical understandings or judicial interpretations of a particular clause include statements that cite to the following clauses: Necessary and Proper Clause : One of the most frequently cited clauses in recent CASs was the Necessary and Proper Clause, which allows Congress to ""make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution"" the powers enumerated in Article I and ""all other Powers vested by [the] Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof."" About a quarter of all CASs in the CRS studies contained a citation to that clause, with 14% of the 2016 CASs and 19% of the 2018 CASs citing the Necessary and Proper Clause as the sole power to enact the underlying legislation.
Citations to the Necessary and Proper Clause in isolation could be seen as somewhat anomalous, as that clause has never been viewed by the Court or by the Framers of the Constitution as a general source of power for Congress to do whatever is ""necessary and proper."" Instead, ""[w]hile the Necessary and Proper Clause authorizes congressional action 'incidental to [an enumerated] power, and conducive to its beneficial exercise,'"" it does not provide Congress with ""great substantive and independent power."" General Welfare Clause: The General Welfare Clause refers to a specific phrase contained within the language in Article I, Section 8, clause 1 empowering Congress to enact certain taxes and spend the money collected from taxation.
Another alternative would be the enforcement power of the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Supreme Court has held allows ""Congress [to] enact so-called prophylactic legislation"" aimed at ""prevent[ing] and deter[ing] unconstitutional conduct."" Nonetheless, it should be noted that the House Rules Committee has suggested that a citation to a provision of the Constitution that does not explicitly grant power to Congress may suffice to comply with the CAS rule.
Finally, several commentators have proposed altering the rule so that Members must not only cite to the Constitution's affirmative grants of authority to Congress, but also discuss any potential limitations the Constitution may impose on Congress's power to legislate."
1,"Purpose and Policy Section 2 states the Resolution's purpose and policy, with Section 2(a) citing as the primary purpose to ""insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and to the continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations."" Section 2(b) points to the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution as the basis for legislation on the war powers.
All of the reports under Section 4(a), which are to be submitted to the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate, are to set forth (A) the circumstances necessitating the introduction of United States Armed Forces; (B) the constitutional and legislative authority under which such introduction took place; and (C) the estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or involvement.
The objectives of these provisions, the conference report stated, was to ""ensure that the Congress by right and as a matter of law will be provided with all the information it requires to carry out its constitutional responsibilities with respect to committing the Nation to war and to the use of United States Armed Forces abroad."" Congressional Action Section 5(a) deals with congressional procedures for receipt of a report under Section 4(a)(1).
After a report ""is submitted or is required to be submitted pursuant to section 4(a)(1), whichever is earlier,"" Section 5(b) requires the President to terminate the use of U.S. Armed Forces after 60 days unless Congress (1) has declared war or authorized the action; (2) has extended the period by law; or (3) is physically unable to meet as a result of an armed attack on the United States.
In his veto message, President Nixon said the Resolution would impose restrictions upon the authority of the President which would be dangerous to the safety of the Nation and ""attempt to take away, by a mere legislative act, authorities which the President has properly exercised under the Constitution for almost 200 years."" The War Powers Resolution in Section 2(c) recognized the constitutional powers of the President as Commander in Chief to introduce forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities as ""exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces."" The executive branch has contended that the President has much broader authority to use forces, including for such purposes as to rescue American citizens abroad, rescue foreign nationals where such action facilitates the rescue of U.S. citizens, protect U.S. Embassies and legations, suppress civil insurrection, implement the terms of an armistice or cease-fire involving the United States, and carry out the terms of security commitments contained in treaties.
The measure, which became law, provided that any joint resolution or bill to require the removal of U.S. Armed Forces engaged in hostilities outside the United States without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization would be considered in accordance with the expedited procedures of Section 601(b) of the International Security and Arms Export Control Act of 1976, except that it would be amendable and debate on a veto limited to 20 hours.
In the case of El Salvador, the memorandum said, U.S. military personnel ""will not act as combat advisors, and will not accompany Salvadoran forces in combat, on operational patrols, or in any other situation where combat is likely."" On May 1, 1981, 11 Members of Congress challenged the President's action by filing suit on grounds that he had violated the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution by sending the advisers to El Salvador.
Neither approach was adopted in legislation, but the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported that the President had ""a clear obligation under the War Powers Resolution to consult with Congress prior to any future decision to commit combat forces to El Salvador."" On July 26, 1983, the House rejected an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill ( H.R. 2969 ) to limit the number of active duty military advisers in El Salvador to 55, unless the President reported any increase above that level under Section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution.
The House Appropriations Committee approved an amendment to the continuing resolution for FY1984 ( H.J.Res. 367 ), sponsored by Representative Clarence Long, providing that after 60 days, funds could not be ""obligated or expended for peacekeeping activities in Lebanon by United States Armed Forces,"" unless the President had submitted a report under Section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution.
The Senate had adopted an amendment supporting the President's use of appropriate diplomatic, economic, and military options ""to restore constitutional government to Panama and to remove General Noriega from his illegal control of the Republic of Panama,"" but had defeated an amendment authorizing the President to use U.S. military force to secure the removal of General Noriega ""notwithstanding any other provision of law."" The Panama action did not raise much discussion in Congress about the War Powers Resolution.
The Defense Authorization Act for FY1994 required a report to Congress by April 1, 1994, including discussion of the requirement of congressional approval for participation of U.S. Armed Forces in multinational peacekeeping missions, proposals to conclude military agreements with the U.N. Security Council under Article 43 of the U.N. Charter, and the applicability of the War Powers Resolution and the U.N. Participation Act. In 1994 and 1995, Congress attempted to gain a greater role in U.N. and other peacekeeping operations through authorization and appropriation legislation.
On August 2, shortly before its recess, the Senate by a vote of 97-0 adopted S.Res. 318 urging the President ""to act immediately, using unilateral and multilateral measures, to seek the full and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory"" and to work for collective international sanctions against Iraq including, if economic sanctions prove inadequate, ""additional multilateral actions, under Article 42 of the United Nations Charter, involving air, sea, and land forces as may be needed...."" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pell stressed, however, that the measure did not authorize unilateral U.S. military actions.
On October 2, 1990, the Senate by a vote of 96-3 adopted S.Con.Res. 147 , stating that ""Congress supports continued action by the President in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations Security Council and in accordance with United States constitutional and statutory processes, including the authorization and appropriation of funds by the Congress, to deter Iraqi aggression and to protect American lives and vital interest in the region."" As in the House, Senate leaders emphasized that the resolution was not to be interpreted as an open-ended resolution similar to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution.
In his statement made after signing H.J.Res. 77 into law, President Bush said the following: ""As I made clear to congressional leaders at the outset, my request for congressional support did not, and my signing this resolution does not, constitute any change in the long-standing positions of the executive branch on either the President's constitutional authority to use the Armed Forces to defend vital U.S. interests or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution."" He added that he was pleased that ""differences on these issues between the President and many in the Congress have not prevented us from uniting in a common objective."" On January 16, President Bush made the determination required by P.L. 102-1 that diplomatic means had not and would not compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
On June 24, 1998, the House passed H.R. 4103 , the Defense Department Appropriations bill for FY1999, with a provision by Representative David Skaggs that banned the use of funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act ""to initiate or conduct offensive military operations by United States Armed Forces except in accordance with the war powers clause of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 8), which vests in Congress the power to declare and authorize war and to take certain specified, related actions."" The Skaggs provision was stricken by the House-Senate conference committee on H.R. 4103 .
On March 31, 1993, the U.N. Security Council authorized member states to take all necessary measures to enforce the ban on military flights over Bosnia, the ""no-fly zone."" NATO planes, including U.S. planes, began patrolling over Bosnia and Herzegovina on April 12, 1993, to enforce the Security Council ban, and the next day, President Clinton reported the U.S. participation ""consistent with Section 4 of the War Powers Resolution."" Conflict continued, but the situation was complicated and opinion in Congress and among U.N. and NATO members was divided.
On September 1, 1995, President Clinton reported ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" that ""U.S. combat and support aircraft"" had been used beginning on August 29, 1995, in a series of NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina that were threatening the U.N.-declared safe areas of Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Gorazde."" He noted that during the first day of operations, ""some 300 sorties were flown against 23 targets in the vicinity of Sarajevo, Tuzla, Gorazde, and Mostar."" On September 7, 1995, the House passed an amendment to the FY1996 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill ( H.R. 2126 ), offered by Representative Mark Neumann that prohibited the obligation or expenditure of funds provided by the bill for any operations beyond those already undertaken.
Subsequently, on October 30, 1995, the House, by a vote of 315-103, passed H.Res. 247 , expressing the sense of the House that ""no United States Armed forces should be deployed on the ground in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to enforce a peace agreement until the Congress has approved such a deployment."" On November 13, President Clinton's 9-page letter to Speaker Gingrich stated he would send a request ""for a congressional expression of support for U.S. participation in a NATO-led Implementation Force in Bosnia ...
On March 18, 1998, the House defeated by a vote of 193-225, H.Con.Res. 227 , a resolution of Representative Tom Campbell, directing the President, pursuant to Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution to remove United States Armed Forces from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( H.Rept.
On June 12, 1999, President Clinton announced and reported to Congress ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution"" that he had directed the deployment of about ""7,000 U.S. military personnel as the U.S. contribution to the approximately 50,000-member, NATO-led security force (KFOR)"" being assembled in Kosovo.
Bush in signing S.J.Res. on September 18, 2001, noted the Congress had acted ""wisely, decisively, and in the finest traditions of our country."" He thanked the ""leadership of both Houses for their role in expeditiously passing this historic joint resolution."" He noted that he had had the ""benefit of meaningful consultations with members of the Congress"" since the September 11 attacks and that he would ""continue to consult closely with them as our Nation responds to this threat to our peace and security."" President Bush also asserted that S.J.Res. 23 ""recognized the authority of the President under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of terrorism against the United States."" He also stated: ""In signing this resolution, I maintain the longstanding position of the executive branch regarding the President's constitutional authority to use force, including the Armed Forces of the United States and regarding the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution."" Prior to its enactment, there was concern among some in Congress that the President might not adhere to the reporting requirements of the War Powers Resolution when he exercised the authority provided in S.J.Res. 23 .
On September 24, 2001, President Bush reported to Congress, ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" and ""Senate Joint Resolution 23"" that in response to terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon he had ordered the ""deployment of various combat-equipped and combat support forces to a number of foreign nations in the Central and Pacific Command areas of operations."" The President noted that as part of efforts to ""prevent and deter terrorism"" he might find it necessary to order additional forces into these and other areas of the world...."" He stated that he could not now predict ""the scope and duration of these deployments,"" nor the ""actions necessary to counter the terrorist threat to the United States."" Subsequently, on October 9, 2001, President George W.
""territory, our citizens, and our way of life, and to the continuing threat of terrorist acts against the United States and our friends and allies."" This military action was ""part of our campaign against terrorism"" and was ""designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Thus, in light of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against United States territory and citizens, the President and Congress, after consultations, agreed to a course of legislative action that did not invoke the War Powers Resolution itself, but substituted a specific authorization measure, S.J.Res. 23 .
In his War Powers Resolution report to Congress, on June 15, 2012, the President noted that he had authorized, during the previous six months, the U.S. military to work closely with the government of Yemen ""to operationally dismantle and ultimately eliminate the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the most active and dangerous affiliate of al-Qa'ida today."" The President added that Our joint efforts have resulted in direct action against a limited number of AQAP operatives and senior leaders in that country who posed a terrorist threat to the United States and our interests.
September 8, 2014, Airstrikes to Assist Iraq, Protect Civilians, Provide Security for U.S. Facilities and Personnel: notification of airstrikes ""in the vicinity of the Haditha Dam in support of Iraqi forces in their efforts to retain control of and defend this critical infrastructure site from ISIL,"" stating that ""[t]hese additional military operations will be limited in their scope and duration as necessary to address this threat and prevent endangerment of U.S. personnel and facilities and large numbers of Iraqi civilians."" In each of these notifications, President Obama cited no war declaration or legislative authorization for use of military force that authorized his actions, but instead relied on his constitutional authority under Article II as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.
Congressional Action Related to War Powers Resolution Requirements A number of legislative proposals have been introduced responding to presidential decisions to deploy U.S. Armed Forces and order the use of military force against the Islamic State and other groups.
Providing an explanation of applicable constitutional and/or legislative authority, President Obama stated that he had directed the deployment ""pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive."" Subsequent notifications updating Congress on the status of U.S. Armed Forces in Niger have been included regularly in the six-month periodic reports under the War Powers Resolution, reflecting an increase of total numbers of troops from approximately 40 in early 2013 to approximately 800 as of the June 2018 notification.
In June 2018, President Trump notified Congress, consistent with the War Powers Resolution, that ""United States Armed Forces, in a non-combat role, have continued to provide military advice and limited information, logistics, and other support to regional forces combatting the Houthi insurgency in Yemen.
In February 2018, Department of Defense counsel argued in a letter to Congress, The limited military and intelligence support that the United States is providing to the KSA-led coalition does not involve any introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities for purposes of the War Powers Resolution or of section 1013 of the Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (50 USC 1546a).
On April 13, 1993, President Clinton reported ""consistent with Section 4 of the War Powers Resolution"" that U.S. forces were participating in a NATO air action to enforce a U.N. ban on all unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina, pursuant to his authority as Commander in Chief.
On April 12, 1994, President Clinton reported ""consistent with"" the War Powers Resolution that combat-equipped U.S. military forces had been deployed to Burundi to conduct possible noncombatant evacuation operations of U.S. citizens and other third-country nationals from Rwanda, where widespread fighting had broken out.
On March 1, 1995, President Clinton reported ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution"" that on February 27, 1995, 1,800 combat-equipped U.S. Armed Forces personnel began deployment into Mogadishu, Somalia, to assist in the withdrawal of U.N. forces assigned there to the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II).
On December 21, 1995, President Clinton notified Congress ""consistent with the War Powers Resolution"" that he had ordered the deployment of approximately 20,000 U.S. military personnel to participate in the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and approximately 5,000 U.S. military personnel would be deployed in other former Yugoslav states, primarily in Croatia.

2,"Since then, Congress has amended the Social Security program for multiple purposes, including to expand coverage, change the minimum age for retirement benefits, provide an automatic cost-of-living adjustment to benefits, and address concerns about solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds.
Members of the minority stated, in the Ways and Means Committee's report to the House, that the old-age benefits program (Title II) and the method by which the money was to be raised to pay for the program (Title VIII) established a ""bureaucracy in the field of insurance in competition with private business."" They contended further that the program would ""destroy old-age retirement systems set up by private industries, which in most instances provide more liberal benefits than are contemplated under Title II."" Although some party members tried to remove the old-age benefits provisions, the majority of Republicans in both chambers nevertheless did vote for the final Social Security bill.
On June 17, 1935, Senator Long offered an amendment to liberalize the proposed old-age assistance program (Title I of the bill) and delete the payroll tax provisions (Title VIII and IX).
House Action On June 2, 1939, following public hearings on the proposed amendments and six weeks of executive sessions, the Committee on Ways and Means reported to the House H.R. 6635, embodying its recommendations for amendments to the Social Security Act. The day before, the House had debated on and voted against the Townsend old-age pension bill.
Representative Sabath (D-IL) said he thought it was ""decidedly out of place to bring the Townsend bill to the floor."" He said that the bill ""had no chance of passing in the first place; neither was it feasible nor possible of operation."" Others branded the bill as ""crackpot,"" and in general objected because they thought that the Social Security program was a better means of caring for the aged, asserting that any liberalization of pensions should be done within the framework of the Social Security Act. Edwin Witte wrote, The members of the House of Representatives at all times took the Townsend movement much more seriously than did the senators.
The minority stated in the committee's report to the House that ""while the bill in no sense represents a complete or satisfactory solution of the problem of Social Security, it at least makes certain improvements in the present law (some of which we have ourselves heretofore suggested) which we believe justify us in supporting it despite its defects."" On June 9, 1939, Representative Havenner (D-CA) offered an amendment, endorsed by the American Federation of Labor, to extend Social Security coverage to workers employed in college clubs or fraternities or sororities; employees in nonprofit religious, charitable, or educational institutions; student nurses; and some agricultural workers.
In a 1942 letter to the Senate Finance Committee, President Roosevelt said that ""a failure to allow the scheduled increase in rates to take place under the present favorable circumstances would cause a real and justifiable fear that adequate funds will not be accumulated to meet the heavy obligations of the future and that the claims for benefits accruing under the present law may be jeopardized."" He also stated that ""expanded Social Security, together with other fiscal measures, would set up a bulwark of economic security for the people now and after the war and at the same time would provide anti-inflationary sources for financing the war."" Members who were opposed to the freeze argued that the scheduled payroll tax increase was important for the long-term soundness of the OASI trust fund and that postponing the tax increase would mean higher payroll tax rates in the future and perhaps government subsidies to meet obligations.
The Finance Committee version of the bill did not include the disability insurance provision passed by the House nor the provision providing federal grants to states for needy persons who were permanently and totally disabled, nor President Truman's health insurance proposal.
The amendments increased OASI benefits for both present and future recipients (by an average of 15% for those on the rolls), permitted recipients to earn $75 a month (instead of $50) without losing OASI benefits, extended wage credits of $160 for each month in which active military or naval service was performed during the period from July 24, 1947, through December 1953, and provided for a disability ""freeze,"" which in principle preserved the Social Security benefits of qualified workers who became permanently and totally disabled before retirement by averaging the person's wages only over his or her working years.
The committee amendment, offered by Senator George (D-GA), to drop the disability freeze provision, was passed by voice vote on June 26, 1952.
The bill also put the disability freeze into effect (see discussion of House action on the 1952 amendments below), with disability determinations to be made by the appropriate State agencies, permitted a recipient to earn up to $1,200 a year without deductions, eliminated the earnings test for people aged 72 or older, and dropped the five years of lowest earnings from average monthly wage determinations for benefit computation purposes.
Senate Action H.R. 9366 as reported by the Finance Committee included the coverage of farm and domestic service workers, ministers, state and local government employees covered by a retirement system, and a small number of professionals.
Among the amendments adopted on the floor by the Senate was a provision by Senator Long (D-LA) to require the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to study the feasibility and costs of providing increased minimum benefits of $55, $60, and $75 a month under the Social Security program.
Senate Action At Senate Finance Committee hearings on the House-passed bill, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Marion Folsom stated that the Administration was opposed to reducing the retirement age to 62 for women and providing disability benefits.
On June 5, 1956, the Senate Finance Committee reported H.R. 7225 after eliminating the Disability Insurance program and the tax increase to pay for it and limiting retirement benefits at age 62 to widows only.
On August 16, 1958, Senator Morse (D-OR) offered an amendment to increase Social Security benefits by 25%, provide health insurance, and make other changes.
(This proposal was more generous than the provisions—also based on the public assistance, i.e., charity approach—already in the report by the Finance Committee.) On August 23, 1960, Senator Javits's amendment was rejected by a vote of 28 (28-R) to 67 (5-R, 62-D).
Conference Action The conferees agreed to the medical care provisions in the Senate-passed bill (i.e., no new title for a program for aged persons not eligible for OAA benefits).
The amendments raised the minimum benefit to $40 per month; permitted men to claim retired worker's benefits at the age of 62, instead of 65, with actuarially reduced benefits; liberalized the insured status requirement so that, subject to the 6-quarter minimum and the 40-quarter maximum, an individual was fully insured if he had one quarter of coverage for every calendar year that elapsed between January 1, 1951, or age 21, whichever was later, and the year before he died, became disabled, or reached retirement age; increased benefits to a surviving aged widow, widower, or dependent parent of an insured deceased worker from 75 to 82.5% of the benefit the worker would have been entitled to if alive; changed the earnings test so that an aged recipient had no benefits withheld if earnings were $1,200 a year or less, $1 withheld for each $2 earned between $1,200 and $1,700, and a $1 reduction in benefits for each additional dollar of earnings above $1,700; and raised the employer and employee tax rates by 0.125% and the self-employed tax rate by 0.1875%.
The proposed Social Security Amendments of 1964 as passed by the House contained a 5% across-the-board Social Security benefit increase; extended the child's benefit to age 22 if he or she were in school; allowed widows to retire at age 60, with actuarially reduced benefits; provided limited benefits to persons aged 72 or older who had some Social Security coverage but not enough to meet the minimum requirements of existing law; and extended Social Security coverage to groups of persons who previously had been excluded.
The proposed Social Security Amendments of 1964 as passed by the Senate contained a hospital insurance program, the so-called King-Anderson bill; increased benefits: raised the earnings base; liberalized the earnings test; changed the eligibility requirements for the blind; and permitted religious groups to reject Social Security coverage if they had religious objections to social insurance.
House Action H.R. 11865, the proposed Social Security Amendments of 1964, was reported out of the Ways and Means Committee on July 7, 1964.
Although a federally operated health insurance program covering the entire nation was considered by the Franklin Roosevelt Administration in 1935, it was not explicitly endorsed until January 1945, when President Roosevelt's budget message called for an ""extended Social Security including medical care."" Such a plan was submitted to Congress by President Truman in November 1945, but neither chamber acted on the proposal, in large part due to strong opposition by the AMA.
On July 7, 1965, Senator Byrd's (D-WV) amendment to lower the age at which workers could receive Social Security benefits to 60 (rather than age 62, the existing minimum) was agreed to by voice vote.
On July 9, 1965, Senator Hartke's (D-IN) amendment to liberalize the definition of blindness under the Social Security program, provide benefits to blind workers with at least 6 quarters of Social Security coverage, and permit blind workers to receive benefits regardless of other earnings was passed by a vote of 78 (28-R, 50-D) to 11 (11-D).
On July 9, 1965, Senator Smathers's (D-FL) amendment to raise payroll taxes to finance the benefits provided in floor amendments passed by a voice vote.
P.L. 89-368, Tax Adjustment Act of 1966 H.R. 12752, signed by President Johnson on March 15, 1966, raised income taxes to help pay for the Vietnam War. It extended OASI benefits of $35 per month to persons over the age of 71 who were not covered, but with the benefit reduced by the amount of payments received under government pension plans, veteran's or civil service pensions, teacher's retirement pension plans, or welfare programs.
Senate Action During the floor debate on H.R. 12752, Senator Prouty (R-VT) offered an amendment to extend a minimum Social Security payment of $44 a month to all persons aged 70 or older who were not then eligible for benefits (an estimated 1.8 million persons at a cost of $760 million in FY1967).
The amendments provided a 13% across-the-board increase in benefits; raised the taxable wage base from $6,600 to $7,800; increased the payroll tax rate from 4.4% on employers and employees each to 4.8% in 1969; raised the minimum benefit from $44 to $55 per month; raised the earnings test limit to $1,680 a year instead of $1,500 (recipient lost $1 in benefits for every $2 earned between $1,680 and $2,880, and lost $1 for each additional dollar earned above $2,880); added benefits for disabled widows and widowers at age 50, with a stricter definition of disability; liberalized the definition of blindness for disability payments; and clarified the definition of disability.
President Johnson had called for a 15% across-the-board increase in OASDI benefits and numerous other changes in the Social Security Act. The proposals were embodied in H.R. 5710, introduced in the House on February 20, 1967, by the Committee on Ways and Means chairman, Wilbur Mills (D-AR).
Senate Action On November 14, 1967, the Senate Finance Committee reported a heavily amended bill that contained several OASDI provisions as recommended by the Administration rather than as modified by the House.
H.R. 17550, with provisions raising benefits by 10%, providing a $100 minimum monthly benefit, raising the taxable wage base from $7,800 to $9,000, and making changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, was passed by the Senate on December 29, 1970, by a vote of 81 (35-R, 46-D) to 0.
Senator Long (D-LA), chairman of the Finance Committee and floor manager of H.R. 4690, said that he had asked the House to take immediate action to raise Social Security benefits and as the House had not responded, he was offering a benefit increase as an amendment to H.R. 4690, a bill to increase the debt ceiling.
On March 12, 1971, Senator Long's amendment to provide a 10% increase in Social Security payments, a $100 minimum monthly benefit, increases in earnings limitations, and other changes passed by a vote of 82 (38-R, 44-D) to 0.
The Senate, on March 12, 1971, passed H.R. 4690, after approving several Social Security changes, including the benefit increase proposed by Senator Long, by a vote of 80 (37-R, 43-D) to 0.
On June 30, 1972, Representative Mills's (D-AR) motion that the House concur with the Senate-passed amendment granting a 20% Social Security benefit increase and annual automatic cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) was accepted by a vote of 302 (108-R, 194-D) to 35 (28-R, 7-D).
On September 28, 1972, Senator Percy's (R-IL) amendment to require the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to review the Social Security earnings test, and report to Congress on the feasibility of eliminating it, was accepted by voice vote.
n September 29, 1972, the Finance Committee's amendment to guarantee every person who worked in employment covered under the Social Security program for at least 30 years a minimum monthly benefit of $200 ($300 for a couple) passed by a vote of 73 (30-R, 43-D) to 0.
Senate Action The Senate Finance Committee approved a number of provisions affecting Social Security, including an initial 7% benefit increase effective upon enactment and a further 4% increase in June 1974.
To make up for the revenue loss due to deletion of the mandatory coverage provisions, the amendment also provided for greater increases in the Social Security tax rate and wage base than those included in the committee bill.
When H.R. 9346 as passed by the House came up for debate on the Senate floor on November 2, 1977, Senator Long (D-LA) introduced an amendment to substitute the Finance Committee Social Security proposals in H.R. 5322 for the House bill.
On October 15, 1981, Senator Dole's (R-KS) amendment to apply the Social Security payroll tax to the first six months of all employer-financed sick pay, except that paid as insurance, was accepted by voice vote.
Conforming to most of the recommendations in the commission's package, the 1983 amendments put new federal employees and all nonprofit organization employees under the OASDI program as of January 1, 1984; prohibited state and local and nonprofit agencies from terminating Social Security coverage; moved the annual cost-of-living adjustments in benefits from July to January of each year (which caused a delay of six months in 1983); made up to one-half of the benefits received by higher income recipients subject to federal income taxation; gradually raised the full benefit retirement age from 65 to 67 early in the 21 st century; increased benefits for certain groups of widow(er)s; liberalized the earnings test; increased the delayed retirement credit; reduced benefits for workers also getting pensions based on noncovered employment; called for the earlier implementation of scheduled payroll tax increases; and substantially raised payroll tax rates on the self-employed.
Senate Action When the Finance Committee approved H.R. 3545 on December 3, 1987, it included the House Social Security coverage provisions.
House Action On July 14, 1988, the Ways and Means Committee approved a ""tax corrections"" bill, H.R. 4333 , that also included some measures affecting Social Security.
Senate Action The Finance Committee adopted about half of the House Social Security provisions.
Among its Social Security provisions, it made permanent a temporary provision, first enacted in 1984 and subsequently extended, that provides the option for recipients to choose to continue to receive disability and Medicare benefits while their termination is being appealed; liberalized the definition of disability for disabled widow(er)s by making it consistent with that for disabled workers; extended benefits to spouses whose marriage to the worker is otherwise invalid, if the spouse was living with the worker before he or she died or filed for benefits; removed the operation of the trust funds from budget deficit calculations under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act; established separate House and Senate procedural safeguards to protect trust fund balances; extended coverage to employees of state and local governments who are not covered by a retirement plan; and raised the maximum amount of earnings subject to HI taxes to $125,000, effective in 1991, with raises thereafter indexed to increases in average wages.
The resulting bill reported from the Budget Committee on October 15, H.R. 5835 , extended Social Security coverage to state and local government workers not covered by a retirement plan and raised the maximum amount of earnings subject to HI taxes to $100,000, effective in 1991.
Conference Action as Modified On July 14, 1993, the House adopted, by a vote of 415 to 0, an amendment by Representative Sabo (D-MN) to instruct its conferees on the bill to accept the Senate version of taxation of benefits.
H.R. 3136 : raised the annual earnings test exempt amount, for recipients who have attained the full retirement age (FRA), over a period of seven years, reaching $30,000 in 2002, and then indexed that amount to wages; prohibited DI and SSI eligibility to individuals whose disability is based on drug addiction or alcoholism; tightened eligibility requirements for entitlements to benefits as a stepchild; and, as a way to produce program savings that would help compensate for the increased costs to the Social Security system due to liberalizing the earnings test, provided funds for additional continuing disability reviews.
House Action On November 28, 1995, the Social Security Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee approved H.R. 2684 , the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act, introduced by Chairman Bunning (R-KY), that would gradually increase the earnings test limits for those aged 65-69 to $30,000 in 2002.
Senate Action On September 17, 2003, the Senate Finance Committee approved an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 743 , as passed by the House, by a voice vote."
3,"Introduction The Federal Reserve's (the Fed's) responsibilities as the nation's central bank fall into four main categories: monetary policy, provision of emergency liquidity through the lender of last resort function, supervision of certain types of banks and other financial firms for safety and soundness, and provision of payment system services to financial firms and the government.
Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Fed, but retains oversight responsibilities to ensure that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."" The Fed has defined stable prices as a longer-run goal of 2% inflation—the change in overall prices, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index.
By contrast, the Fed states that ""it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."" Monetary policy can be used to stabilize business cycle fluctuations (alternating periods of economic expansions and recessions) in the short run, while it mainly affects inflation in the long run.
Recent Monetary Policy Developments In December 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis and the ""Great Recession,"" the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%.
Although monetary policy is now less stimulative than it had been at the zero lower bound, the Fed is still adding stimulus to the economy as long as the federal funds rate is below what economists call the ""neutral rate"" (or the long-run equilibrium rate).
Economic Effects of Monetary Policy in the Short Run and Long Run How do changes in short-term interest rates affect the overall economy?
These steps included reducing the federal funds rate to the zero lower bound, providing direct financial assistance to financial firms, and ""quantitative easing."" These unconventional policy decisions continue to have consequences for monetary policy today, as the Fed embarks on monetary policy ""normalization.""  The Early Stages of the Crisis and the Zero Lower Bound The bursting of the housing bubble led to the onset of a financial crisis that affected both depository institutions and other segments of the financial sector involved with housing finance.
Direct Assistance During and After the Financial Crisis With liquidity problems persisting as the federal funds rate was reduced, it appeared that the traditional transmission mechanism linking monetary policy to activity in the broader economy was not working.
The loans and other assistance provided by the Federal Reserve to banks and nonbank institutions are considered assets on this balance sheet because they represent money owed to the Fed. With the federal funds rate at its zero bound and direct lending falling as financial conditions began to normalize in 2009, the Fed faced the decision of whether to try to provide additional monetary stimulus through unconventional measures.
Quantitative Easing and the Growth in the Fed's Balance Sheet and Bank Reserves With short-term rates constrained by the zero bound, the Fed hoped to reduce long-term rates through large-scale asset purchases, which were popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE)."
4,"The new statute, later codified as 10 U.S.C. 2687 (Section 612 of the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1978, P.L. 95-82 ), generally required DOD to conduct comprehensive and lengthy assessments of major basing decisions as part of a congressional report-and-wait process.
The hallmarks of this framework include establishment of an independent commission whose members are appointed by the President, in consultation with congressional leadership (and the advice and consent of the Senate); reliance on objective and uniform criteria for evaluating basing recommendations; GAO review and certification of DOD data; deliberations that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; requirement that the commission's final list of closure and realignment actions be accepted or rejected in its entirety; and presidential and congressional off-ramps that would terminate the BRAC process when certain conditions are not met.
BRAC Selection Criteria BRAC is often characterized as a cost efficiency measure that enables DOD to more effectively manage its real property assets by allowing it to shed excess infrastructure, but historically, potential costs and savings have been a consideration that have ranked below military value.
OTHER CRITERIA.—The other criteria that the Secretary shall use in making recommendations for the closure or realignment of military installations inside the United States under this part in 2005 are as follows: (1) The extent and timing of potential costs and savings, including the number of years, beginning with the date of completion of the closure or realignment, for the savings to exceed the costs.
In addition to refining DOD accounting metrics, some observers have suggested congressional visibility into BRAC cost and long-term effectiveness could be improved by amending the process to require the Department to disclose how closure and realignment recommendations meet expected cost saving and reduced infrastructure targets.
In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, Lucian Niemeyer, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment, indicated DOD would be working in FY2019 to improve its excess infrastructure accounting processes and demolish unneeded infrastructure: In lieu of another request for legislation in FY 2019 to authorize an additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, we will review our facilities, to include facility usage optimization review to ensure we have a better accounting of excess infrastructure."
5,"The requirement that federal agencies generally reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000) but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small businesses that are competitive with market prices and the quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased.
3. The requirement that federal agencies generally set aside contracts that have an anticipated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small businesses offering the products of different small businesses (Rule of Two) and the award will be made at a fair market price.
Federal Agencies To make it easier to determine if an offeror meets the SBA's definition of a small business, prior to soliciting bids, federal agencies are required to classify a product or service being acquired in only one (NAICS code) industry, ""whose definition best describes the principal nature of the product or service being acquired even though for other purposes it could be classified in more than one."" When acquiring a product or service that could be classified in two or more industries with different size standards, contracting officers must ""apply the size standard for the industry accounting for the greatest percentage of the contract price."" If a solicitation calls for more than one item and allows offers to be submitted on any or all of the items, ""an offeror must meet the size standard for each item it offers to furnish."" If a solicitation calling for more than one item requires offers on all or none of the items, ""an offeror may qualify as a small business by meeting the size standard for the item accounting for the greatest percentage of the total contract price."" With several notable exceptions (e.g., HUBZone small businesses, SBA 8(a) program participants, and veteran-owned small businesses [VOSBs] and SDVOSBs seeking contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs), businesses generally self-certify their status as small when they register their business in the SAM database.
§644(e)(1) states, ""To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by a Federal department or agency having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers."" To accomplish this goal, FAR regulations (FAR §19.202-1) require contracting officers, when applicable, to take the following actions prior to awarding a federal contract: 1.
Conduct periodic reviews of the agency's contracting activity, including the agency's assessment of any required small business subcontracting plan, ""to ascertain whether the agency is complying with the small business policies in this regulation."" Sponsor and participate in conferences and training ""designed to increase small business participation in the contracting activities of the office."" The Role of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Every federal agency (except the SBA) that has procurement powers is required to have an OSDBU, whose director, by statute, reports directly to the head of the agency and has supervisory authority over agency staff performing certain procurement functions.
Among its statutory responsibilities are the following:  ""Identify proposed solicitations that involve significant bundling of contract requirements, and work with the agency acquisition officials and the Administration to revise the procurement strategies for such proposed solicitations where appropriate to increase the probability of participation by small businesses as prime contractors, or to facilitate small business participation as subcontractors and suppliers, if a solicitation for a bundled contract is to be issued."" Assist small businesses ""to obtain payments, required late payment interest penalties, or information regarding payments due to the concern from an executive agency or a contractor."" Assign ""a small business technical adviser to each office to which the SBA has assigned"" a PCR.
Ensure that a small business that notifies the PCR prior to a contract's award that ""a solicitation, request for proposal, or request for quotation unduly restricts [its] ability … to compete for the award … is aware of other resources and processes available to address unduly restrictive provisions … even if such resources and processes are provided by such agency, the Administration, the Comptroller General, or a Department of Defense (DOD) procurement technical assistance program [described below]."" Review all subcontracting plans ""to ensure that the plan provides maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns to participate in the performance of the contract to which the plan applies."" In accordance with P.L. 109-163 , the National Defense Authorization Act of 2006, the DOD renamed its OSDBU the Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP).
The SBA has four commercial market r epresentatives who, among other duties, help prime contractors find small businesses that are capable of performing subcontracts; provide counseling on the contractor's responsibility to maximize subcontracting opportunities for small businesses; and conduct periodic reviews of contractors awarded contracts requiring an acceptable subcontracting plan that provides small businesses ""the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in contract performance consistent with its efficient performance"" (generally any solicitation to perform a contract that is expected to exceed $700,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has subcontracting possibilities).
The 8(a) Mentor-Protégé Program is a government-wide program designed to assist small businesses ""owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals"" participating in the SBA's Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program (commonly known as the 8(a) program) in obtaining and performing federal contracts."
6,"For example, some contend that climate change poses a ""direct, existential threat"" to human society and that nations must start making significant reductions in GHG emissions in order to avoid ""dire effects."" To support this argument, proponents of climate change mitigation highlight the evidence and conclusions from recent reports that are generally considered authoritative, including: 1.
The third section discusses additional considerations associated with a carbon tax program, including estimates of GHG emissions, federal revenue, and fossil fuel prices and changes in energy use.
When deciding how to allocate the new revenue stream, policymakers would likely encounter trade-offs among objectives, including: reducing the economy-wide costs resulting from a carbon tax program; alleviating the costs borne by subgroups in the U.S. population, particularly low-income households and/or communities most dependent on carbon-intensive economic activity; and supporting specific policy objectives, such as domestic employment, climate change adaptation, energy efficiency, technological advance, energy diversity, or federal deficit reduction, among others.
Multiple economic studies and models have examined and compared various options for addressing the economy-wide impacts that may result from a carbon tax.
In general, the economic models find that certain revenue recycling options may reduce the economy-wide carbon tax impacts but may not eliminate them entirely.
These results indicate that, in certain modeling conditions, the economic improvements gained by reducing existing distortionary taxes would be greater than the costs imposed by the new carbon tax (without including the intended climate benefits of the policy).
In general, the economic carbon tax studies usually agree on the relative ranking of revenue recycling options in terms of their ability to mitigate the economy-wide impacts of a carbon tax program.
A number of economic studies have used models to estimate the impacts of a carbon tax across households under several revenue distribution scenarios.
In a 2018 carbon tax study, economic modelers assessed a scenario in which a portion of the revenue was used to offset the welfare impacts for the lowest-income household quintile and the remaining revenue supported reductions in capital tax rates.
Additional Considerations Impacts on GHG Emission Levels Multiple economic studies have estimated the emission reductions that particular carbon tax designs could achieve.
Table 2 includes estimates of price increases on coal, crude oil, natural gas, home heating oil, and motor gasoline based on a carbon tax rate of $25/mtCO 2 that applies CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion.
Concluding Observations A carbon tax is one policy option to address U.S. GHG emission levels, which contribute to climate change and related impacts.
Economic modeling indicates that a carbon tax would achieve emission reductions, the level of which would depend on which GHG emissions and sources are covered and the rate of the carbon tax."
7,"The Board may also order federal agencies to comply with Board orders, conduct special studies of the civil service and other executive branch merit systems, and review Office of Personnel Management (OPM) rules and regulations to determine, for example, whether a federal agency has invalidly implemented the OPM requirements.
Although other MSPB employees, including administrative judges who issue initial decisions in cases, will continue their work, some Members of Congress and others have raised concerns about the extent to which these vacancies limit the agency's ability to perform its other functions.
The Board has original jurisdiction over actions brought by the Special Counsel for corrective and disciplinary action, specified removals of persons in the Senior Executive Service (SES), and certain adverse personnel actions taken against administrative law judges (ALJs).
Cases may be heard by Board members directly, or referred to ALJs or Board employees called ""administrative judges."" ALJs typically adjudicate and issue initial decisions in cases involving corrective and disciplinary action.
For employees who are neither ALJs nor members of the SES, the applicable standard is cause ""as will promote the efficiency of the service."" An ALJ who is subject to a final Board decision authorizing a proposed agency action may obtain judicial review before the Federal Circuit.
that the MSPB and the courts should 'give deference to the judgment by each agency of the employee's performance in light of the agency's assessment of its own personnel needs and standards.'"" The Federal Circuit noted that allowing the Board to mitigate penalties in chapter 43 actions would give the agency more authority than Congress intended.
§ 7703, federal employees or applicants for employment who are adversely affected by a final order or decision of the MSPB may obtain judicial review."
8,"An individual selected for a continuing position is generally appointed as a career-conditional employee subject to an initial one-year probationary period.
Adverse Action Protections and Procedures Employees in the competitive service who are not serving a probationary or trial period, or have completed one year of current continuous service in a position other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less, maintain specified notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions.
Unlike career appointees, noncareer appointees are not subject to the competitive selection process, but agency heads must determine that these appointees meet the qualifications of the SES position.
Career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons."
9,"Although basic pay is usually the largest component of cash compensation that a servicemember receives, there are other types of military pay that increase it significantly.
Regular Military Compensation (RMC) RMC, as defined in law, is ""the total of the following elements that a member of the uniformed services accrues or receives, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind every payday: basic pay, basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence, and federal tax advantage accruing to the aforementioned allowances because they are not subject to federal income tax."" Though military compensation is structured much differently than civilian compensation, making comparison difficult, RMC provides a more complete understanding of the cash compensation provided to all servicemembers.
As a result of this methodology, BAH rates are much higher in some areas than others, but servicemembers of similar paygrade and dependents status should be able to pay for roughly comparable housing regardless of their duty location.
However, in the case of a downward adjustment, a ""save pay"" provision on the BAH statute prevents the decrease from applying to individuals currently assigned to that locality: ""So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing within an area of the United States, the monthly amount of the allowance for the member may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member."" Thus, only personnel newly assigned to the area receive the lower payment.
The House-passed version of the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) contained no provision to specify the rate of increase in basic pay.
Section 601 of the House-passed version of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) required the statutory formula increase (2.4%) to go into effect, ""notwithstanding any determination made by the President under subsection (e) of such section with respect to an alternative pay adjustment....
Section 601 of the House version of the FY2017 NDAA ( H.R. 4909 ) required the statutory formula increase (2.1%) to go into effect, ""notwithstanding any determination made by the President under subsection (e) of such section with respect to an alternative pay adjustment....
The House version of the FY2016 NDAA ( H.R. 1735 ) contained no provision to specify the rate of increase in basic pay, although the report accompanying it stated that the committee supported a 2.3% increase.
The House version of the FY2015 NDAA contained no statutory provision to specify the rate of increase in basic pay, although the report accompanying it stated that the committee supported a 1.8% increase; it also included a provision to prevent general and flag officers from receiving any increase in basic pay in 2015.
The Senate committee-reported version contained a provision waiving the automatic adjustment of 37 U.S.C. 1009 and setting the pay increase at 1.0% for servicemembers, but excluded generals and admirals.
No general pay raise provision was included in the final version of the NDAA, thereby leaving in place the 1.0% increase specified by President Obama.
No general pay raise provision was included in the final version of the NDAA, thereby leaving in place the 1.0% increase specified by President Obama.
One common method of comparison is to calculate the cumulative difference between increases in military and civilian pay using military basic pay, a narrow measure of cash compensation that does not include, for example, tax-free allowances for housing and food.
Additionally, general increases in basic pay higher than the rate of increase in the ECI (2000-2010) and the elimination of ""out-of-pocket"" housing expenses by 2005 pushed servicemember RMC up substantially in relation to civilian compensation."
10,"Overview As Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi consolidates his power amid a continuing macroeconomic recovery, Egypt is poised to play an increasingly active role in the region, albeit from a more independent position vis-a-vis the United States than in the past.
But there is no doubt that the suffering resulting from the lack of reform is much worse."" The IMF has praised the Egyptian government's record of reform implementation, while also highlighting the need for private sector growth ""that will absorb the rapidly growing labor force and ensure that the benefits are perceived more widely."" After several years of observers seeing Egypt as more inwardly focused, several recent developments suggest an increasingly active foreign policy.
According to the U.S. State Department's report on human rights conditions in Egypt in 2017: The most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents; major terrorist attacks; disappearances; torture; harsh or potentially life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; including the use of military courts to try civilians; political prisoners and detainees; unlawful interference in privacy; limits on freedom of expression, including criminal ""defamation of religion"" laws; restrictions on the press, internet, and academic freedom; and restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association, including government control over registration and financing of NGOs [nongovernmental organizations].
Select international human rights, democracy, and development monitoring organizations provide the following rankings for Egypt globally: Other human rights issues of potential interest to Congress may include the 2013 convictions of American, European, and Egyptian civil society representatives; the controversial 2017 NGO law; the detention of American citizens in Egypt; and the treatment of Coptic Christians, discussed in the following sections.
According to Human Rights Watch , ""the new law allows governors to deny church-building permits with no stated way to appeal, requires that churches be built 'commensurate with' the number of Christians in the area, and contains security provisions that risk subjecting decisions on whether to allow church construction to the whims of violent mobs."" The Economy For 2019, the IMF projects 5.3% GDP growth for the Egyptian economy, noting that the outlook remains ""favorable, supported by strong policy implementation."" In 2016, the IMF and Egypt reached a three-year, $12 billion loan agreement, $10 billion of which has been disbursed as of March 2019.
Votel testified before Congress, stating that the ""Egyptian Armed Forces have more effectively fought ISIS in the Sinai and are now taking active measures to address the underlying issues that give life to—to these violent extremist groups and are helping to contain the threat."" Beyond the Sinai: Other Egyptian Insurgent Groups Outside of the Sinai, either in the western desert near the Libya border or other areas (Cairo, Nile Delta, Upper Egypt), small nationalist insurgent groups, such as Liwa al Thawra (The Revolution Brigade) and Harakat Sawaed Misr (Arms of Egypt Movement, referred to by its Arabic acronym HASM), have carried out high-level assassinations of military/police officials and bombings of infrastructure.
According to Macron, ""I can't see how you can pretend to ensure long-term stability in this country, which was at the heart of the Arab Spring and showed its taste for freedom, and think you can continue to harden beyond what's acceptable or justified for security reasons."" Trump Administration Policy toward Egypt  President Trump has praised the Egyptian government's counterterrorism efforts while his Administration has worked to restore high-level diplomatic engagement, joint military exercises, and arms sales.
According to Human Rights Watch , ""Al-Sisi's government is encouraged by the continued silence of its allies, and if the US, UK, and France want to avoid the destabilizing consequences of entrenching authoritarian rule in Egypt, they should act now."" On February 22, 2019, a bipartisan group of national security experts called on U.S. officials to ""express strong concern about the amendments to the Egyptian constitution now moving through a rapid approval process."" Egypt's poor record on human rights and democratization has sparked regular criticism from U.S. officials and some Members of Congress.
Per Section 7041(a)(3)(A) of P.L. 115-141 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2018, $300 million in FMF remains withheld from obligation until the Secretary of State certifies that Egypt is taking various steps toward supporting democracy and human rights.
The FY2019 Omnibus ( P.L. 116-6 ) provides the following for Egypt: a total of $1.419 billion in bilateral U.S. foreign assistance for Egypt, of which $1.3 billion is in FMF, $112.5 million in ESF, $3 million in NADR, $2 million in INCLE, and $1.8 million in IMET; and a reauthorization of ESF to support future loan guarantees to Egypt; P.L. 116-6 sets the following conditions for Egypt: As in previous years, it requires that funds may only be made available when the Secretary of State certifies that the government of Egypt is sustaining the strategic relationship with the United States and meeting its obligations under the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty.
Military Aid and Arms Sales Overview Since the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty, the United States has provided Egypt with large amounts of military assistance."
11,"Introduction This report provides a comprehensive summary of the federal financial assistance provided to the Gulf Coast states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas in response to the widespread destruction that resulted from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005 and Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.
The federal government played a significant role in the response to the hurricanes and Congress appropriated funds for a wide range of activities and efforts to help the Gulf Coast states recover and rebuild from the storms.
Section I presents funding provided to the five Gulf Coast states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike. Funding amounts were compiled by CRS analysts who reviewed legislative texts of supplemental appropriations.
Section I: Summary of Gulf Coast Disaster Supplemental Appropriations   Table 1 presents data on the appropriations enacted after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike from FY2005 to FY2009, by federal entity and subentity, when possible and applicable.
Under the largest disaster program, Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program (SURE), the combined payments for Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas totaled $285 million in 2008 for a variety of natural disaster losses, including hurricane damage ( Table 4 ).
Disaster FSP benefits provided approximately $1 billion worth of support directly due to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike. Assistance provided by FSP (now, SNAP) and the child nutrition programs required no additional appropriations because the benefits are treated as entitlements.
Funding Narrative  Congress did not provide EAA supplemental appropriations for disaster recovery activities related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Wilma.
Department of Education48 Elementary and Secondary Education  Program Authorities49  Following the Gulf Coast hurricanes, funding to support elementary and secondary schools affected by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita was provided through three public laws: P.L. 109-148 ($1.4 billion), P.L. 109-234 ($235 million), and P.L. 110-28 ($30 million).
Congress then appropriated an additional $15 million through P.L. 110-329 to provide support to local educational agencies (LEAs) whose enrollment of homeless students increased as a result of hurricanes, including Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, floods, or other natural disasters during 2008.
While the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act continues to provide funding related to the education of homeless students, the provisions enacted specifically in response to the Gulf Coast hurricanes are no longer authorized.
Homeless Education Disaster Assistance55  P.L. 110-329 provided $15 million to LEAs whose enrollment of homeless students increased as a result of hurricanes, floods, or other natural disasters that occurred during 2008 and for which the President declared a major disaster under Title IV of the Stafford Act. ED was required to distribute the funds through the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act based on demonstrated need.
These funds provided assistance to LEAs in Gulf Coast states affected by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, as well as LEAs affected by natural disasters in other parts of the nation, such as flooding in the Midwest.
Gulf Coast Recovery Initiative P.L. 111-117 provided $12 million for competitive awards to LEAs located in counties in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas that were designated by FEMA as counties eligible for individual assistance as a result of damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Gustav.
Higher Education Disaster Relief58  P.L. 110-329 provided an additional $15 million for IHEs that were located in an area affected by hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters that occurred during 2008 and for which the President declared a major disaster under Title IV of the Stafford Act. Funds provided through the Higher Education Disaster Relief program could be used to defray the expenses incurred by IHEs that were forced to close or relocate or whose operations were adversely affected by the natural disaster, and to provide grants to students who attended such IHEs for academic years beginning on or after July 1, 2008.
The majority of these funds were provided to Louisiana and Texas for hurricane-related education disaster assistance related to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. This program is no longer authorized.
DRF-Funded Crisis Counseling Program (CCP)  Pursuant to Section 416 of the Stafford Act, the President may provide assistance for the establishment of crisis counseling services in areas affected by declared major disasters.
Federal Assistance for Health Care  In response to Hurricane Katrina, Congress authorized and appropriated a one-time program of up to $2.1 billion to cover full federal funding of the state match that would normally have been required under the Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance (CHIP) programs, and the costs of uncompensated care, for eligible individuals from disaster-affected areas.
In response to the major hurricanes, HHS invoked numerous waiver authorities that allowed state, local, tribal, and private health care providers and facilities affected by the disasters to continue receiving federal health care services and/or reimbursements under altered conditions, such as the use of temporary facilities, the use of volunteer providers, and care provided to individuals not usually eligible.
Program Description The primary mission of FEMA is to ""reduce the loss of life and property and protect the Nation from all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, by leading and supporting the Nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation.""  FEMA provides assistance to states, local governments, tribal nations, individuals and families, and certain nonprofit organizations through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF).
A total of $4.296 billion was awarded to five of six states included in Table 20 to support disaster recovery activities in response to Hurricane Ike. Texas accounted for 71% of the total followed by Louisiana (25%), Tennessee (2%), Florida (1.8%), and Mississippi (less than 1%).
Chapter 8 of Title I of Division B of the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 ( P.L. 109-148 ) provided $9 million for the USMS's salaries and expenses account ""to support operational recovery from hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region."" Federal Bureau of Investigation Program Authority or Authorities Subtitle A of Title XI of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-162 ) authorized $5.761 billion for FY2006, $5.992 billion for FY2007, $6.231 billion for FY2008, and $6.481 billion for FY2009 for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) account.
Chapter 8 of Title I of Division B of the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 ( P.L. 109-148 ) provided $45 million for the FBI's salaries and expenses account ""to support operational recovery from hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region."" Drug Enforcement Administration Program Authority or Authorities Subtitle A of Title XI of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-162 ) authorized $1.716 billion for FY2006, $1.785 billion for FY2007, $1.856 billion for FY2008, and $1.930 billion for FY2009 for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) account.
Chapter 8 of Title I of Division B of the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 ( P.L. 109-148 ) provided $20 million for the ATF's salaries and expenses account ""to support operational recovery from hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region."" Federal Prison System (Bureau of Prisons) Program Authority Subtitle A of Title XI of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-162 ) authorized $5.066 billion for FY2006, $5.268 billion for FY2007, $5.479 billion for FY2008, and $5.698 billion for FY2009 for the Federal Prison System account.
Chapter 8 of Title I of Division B of the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 ( P.L. 109-148 ) provided $11 million for the BOP's buildings and facilities account ""to repair hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region."" Office of Justice Programs Program Authorities Congress has not traditionally authorized appropriations for the Office of Justice Programs (OJP); rather it has authorized appropriations for grant programs administered by the OJP.
Funding Narrative  Since 2005, Congress has appropriated $175 million for OJP for grants to assist states affected by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
Funding provided for hurricane relief includes funds from the program's annual $100 million authorization and from additional sums provided in supplemental or other appropriations acts.
The majority of the $6 million emergency appropriations provided within the EPA Environmental Programs and Management appropriations account was used to fund contractors for analytical and other disaster support and to purchase equipment, including replacement of expended or damaged air monitors, within Louisiana and Mississippi.
EPA provided $1.4 million of the EPM supplemental funding to its Office of Research and Development and Office of Air and Radiation for continued disaster and emergency response support, including analysis in its laboratories and air monitoring, across states affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Although, following a presidentially declared emergency, public drinking water and wastewater utilities are eligible for FEMA supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster damaged facilities, the portions of the annual fiscal year SRF grant allotments to states may have also been used to supplement these projects.
P.L. 110-28 provided a waiver of all state and local cost-shares for four disaster assistance programs that are a part of the Stafford Act. These programs included Section 403 (Essential Assistance), Section 406 (Repair, Restoration, and Replacement of Damaged Facilities), Section 407 (Debris Removal), and Section 408 (Federal Assistance to Individuals and Households)."
12,"Introduction This report provides background information and analysis on the following topics: Various aspects of U.S.-Turkey relations, including (1) Turkey's strategic orientation; (2) U.S./NATO cooperation and how a Turkish purchase of an S-400 air defense system from Russia could endanger its acquisition of U.S.-origin F-35 aircraft; (3) the situation in northern Syria, including with Kurdish-led militias; (4) criminal cases of note since the failed 2016 coup attempt in Turkey; and (5) congressional proposals.
Domestic Turkish developments, including politics under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's largely authoritarian and polarizing rule (with local elections scheduled for March 2019), and significant economic concerns.
In the months since the apparent October 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate, some observers speculate that President Erdogan has sought to use information from the event to gain leverage in Turkey's dealings with the United States, and to boost Turkey's regional and global profile.
However, efforts to increase Turkey's influence and offer it as a ""model"" for other regional states appear to have been set back by a number of developments since 2011: (1) conflict and instability that engulfed the region and Turkey's own southern border, (2) Turkey's failed effort to help Muslim Brotherhood-aligned groups gain lasting power in Syria and North Africa, and (3) domestic polarization accompanied by government repression.
Much of the report was classified, but an unclassified summary said that the U.S. government has told Turkey that purchasing the S-400 would have ""unavoidable negative consequences for U.S.-Turkey bilateral relations, as well as Turkey's role in NATO,"" including potential sanctions against Turkey under Section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA, P.L. 115-44 ); risk to Turkish participation in the F-35 program (both aircraft acquisition and industrial workshare); risk to other potential U.S. arms transfers to Turkey, and to broader bilateral defense industrial cooperation; reduction in NATO interoperability; and introduction of ""new vulnerabilities from Turkey's increased dependence on Russia for sophisticated military equipment."" U.S. Offer of Patriot System as Alternative to S-400 In July 2018, a State Department official confirmed ongoing U.S. efforts to persuade Turkey to purchase a Patriot air defense system instead of an S-400.
In a New York Times column in January, President Erdogan envisioned that if Turkish-backed forces gain control of predominantly Kurdish areas in Syria currently under YPG rule, these regions would be run by popularly elected local councils advised by Turkish officials."
13,"Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program Eligible Public Safety Officers To be eligible for PSOB benefits for death or disability, a person must have served in one of the following categories of public safety officers: law enforcement officer, firefighter, or chaplain in a public agency; FEMA employee or a state, local, or tribal emergency management agency employee; or emergency medical services member.
Payments to Survivors PSOB death benefits are payable to the eligible spouse and children of a public safety officer.
Eligibility The spouse or child of a public safety officer who is eligible for PSOB death or disability benefits may be eligible for PSOEA benefits."
14,"In recent years, Congress has passed laws to create and improve systems used by government departments and agencies to report and input data on federal awards for contracts, grants, and other financial assistance:  P.L. 109-282 , the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA), called for the creation of a database that became USAspending.gov.
The DATA Act followed eight years later and required the Department of the Treasury and OMB to develop government-wide data standardization to consolidate, automate, and simplify reports on grant awards and contracts to improve underreporting and inconsistencies as identified by GAO.
These requirements in the DATA Act were intended to expand on the transparency efforts originally mandated by FFATA, specifically by disclosing direct agency expenditures and linking federal contract, loan, and grant spending information to federal agency programs; establishing government-wide data standards for financial data and providing consistent, reliable, and searchable data that are displayed accurately; simplifying reporting, streamlining reporting requirements, and reducing compliance costs, while improving transparency; and improving the quality of data submitted to USAspending.gov by holding agencies accountable.
For example Federal grants may go first to the state (the state capital, in one CD), then be distributed to a city or county government (in one or more additional CDs), which then may pass the funds to an organization that spends the money in other CDs. A CD in which a state capital is located may appear to receive more federal funds than other CDs in the state, but searching USAspending.gov data by place of performance rather than recipient location would identify data by the project location."
15,"To facilitate the presentation of the tax equity approach to subsidization, three categories of tax credits that either currently use or have recently used this mechanism are examined: the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC); the new markets tax credit (NMTC); and two energy-related tax credits—the renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) and energy investment tax credit (ITC).
The developer and investors will negotiate how much equity capital will be contributed in exchange for the right to claim the tax credits and other tax benefits.
While tax equity investors are not generally required to have an active management role, they have an incentive to monitor the project to ensure it complies with the program's rules, since compliance violations can result in forfeiture of tax credits.
Depending on the structure of the arrangement, the tax equity investor may also secure other benefits, such as additional state and federal tax incentives, a claim to operating income and losses, a share of any capital gains when the underlying investment is sold, or goodwill with the community or regulators.
Tax equity investors in renewable energy projects generally have returns that consist of both tax attributes and operating cash flow to conform to guidance provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Returning to the previous example, if a tax equity investor agrees to contribute 90 cents in equity financing per $1.00 of federal tax credit, it means that for every $1.00 in government subsidy (i.e., tax credit), 10 cents is diverted away from subsidizing the underlying activity and to the investor and middlemen.
The subsidy flowing into a project depends on the price tax equity investors receive in exchange for their financing contributions.
Although some direct changes were made to several incentives that use the tax equity mechanism, there have also been concerns that the reduction in corporate tax rates and overall corporate tax liabilities could curb investor appetite for credits, and reduce the amount of tax equity investment being offered in the market.
For example, affordable housing developers are awarded LIHTCs by officials in each state who review applications, decisions regarding NMTC applications are made by federal officials, and renewable energy tax credits have no similar application and review process.
The tax equity investor may provide upfront cash to the project company, in exchange for production or investment tax credits, depreciation, interest deductions, and operating income."
16,"Introduction Social Security provides dependent benefits and survivors benefits , sometimes collectively referred to as auxiliary benefits , to the spouses, former spouses, widow(er)s, children, and parents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers.
Social Security spousal benefits (i.e., benefits for a wife or husband of the primary earner) are payable to the spouse or divorced spouse of a retired or disabled worker.
Currently Married or Separated Spouses Social Security provides a spousal benefit that is equal to 50% of a retired or disabled worker's PIA.
An individual who is entitled to a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work record and to a spousal benefit in effect receives the higher of the two benefits (see "" Dually Entitled Beneficiaries "" below).
As with spouses of retired or disabled workers, a surviving spouse who is entitled to a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work record and a widow(er)'s benefit receives in effect the higher of the two benefits (see "" Dually Entitled Beneficiaries "" below).
In addition, a divorced spouse who is entitled to a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work record and a spousal or survivor benefit receives in effect the higher of the two benefits (see "" Dually Entitled Beneficiaries "" below).
Dually Entitled Beneficiaries A person may qualify for a spousal or survivor benefit as well as for a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work record (a retired-worker benefit).
Putting this in a different perspective, some two-earner couples may have to contribute significantly more to Social Security to receive the same retirement and spousal benefits that the system provides to a one-earner couple with identical total household earnings.
Further, the surviving spouse in the first couple (the one-earner couple) receives a larger monthly benefit than the survivor of the second couple (a two-earner couple with earnings evenly split)—$1,770 compared with $1,120—although both couples paid the same amount of Social Security payroll tax contributions.
In addition, earnings sharing has sometimes been suggested as a way to provide benefits to divorced women whose marriages did not last long enough (at least 10 years) to allow them to qualify for divorced spousal or survivors benefits.
Divorced Spouse Benefits Under the current Social Security program, a divorced spouse must have been married to the worker for at least 10 years to qualify for spousal and survivors benefits based on the worker's record, as discussed above.
One approach to extend Social Security spousal and survivors benefits to more divorced spouses would be to lower the 10-year marriage requirement (for example, to 5 or 7 years).
Survivor's Benefit Increased to 75% of Couple's Combined Benefit Under current law, an aged surviving spouse receives the higher of his or her own retired-worker benefit and 100% of the deceased spouse's PIA."
17,"Most workers in single-employer plans taken over by PBGC and multiemployer plans that receive financial assistance from PBGC receive the full pension benefit that they earned.
However, among participants in multiemployer plans that were terminated and likely to need financial assistance in the future, 49% have a benefit below the PBGC maximum guarantee and 51% have a benefit larger than the PBGC maximum guarantee.
The sponsors of single-employer and multiemployer pension plans pay a flat-rate, per-participant premium.
Single-employer termination premium : The sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans that end in certain situations pay an annual premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years following plan termination.
Pension Benefit Guaranty PBGC's single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs operate differently and PBGC maintains separate reserve funds for each program.
This suggests that a larger percentage of participants in plans that receive PBGC financial assistance in the future are likely to see benefit reductions as a result of the PBGC maximum guarantee level.
PBGC's main liabilities are the estimated present values of (1) future benefits payments in the single-employer program and (2) future financial assistance to insolvent plans in the multiemployer program.
The revolving funds contain the premiums paid by single-employer and multiemployer pension plan sponsors, returns on revolving funds' investments, and transfers from the trust fund that are used to pay benefits."
18,"Introduction and Overview The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Department of the Interior's Central Utah Project (CUP) and Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC).
The FY2020 budget request proposes substantial reductions from the FY2019 enacted level for DOE energy research and development (R&D) programs, including a reduction of $178 million (-24%) in fossil fuels and $502 million (-38%) in nuclear energy.
Lynch.) Funding Issues and Initiatives Several issues raised by the Administration's budget request could generate controversy during congressional consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020.
The issues described in this section—listed approximately in the order the affected agencies appear in the Energy and Water Development bill—were selected based on the total funding involved, the percentage of proposed increases or decreases, and potential impact on broader public policy considerations.
According to DOE, the proposed elimination of the grant programs is ""due to a departmental shift in focus away from deployment activities and towards early-stage R&D."" Proposed Cuts in Energy R&D Appropriations for DOE R&D on energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil energy would be reduced from $4.133 billion in FY2019 to $1.729 billion (-58%) under the Administration's FY2020 budget request.
""The Budget focuses DOE resources toward early-stage R&D, where the Federal role is strongest, and reflects an increased reliance on the private sector to fund later-stage research, development, and commercialization of energy technologies,"" according to the FY2020 DOE request.
On March 22, 2019, after the FY2020 budget request had been submitted, DOE provided $3.7 billion in additional Title 17 loan guarantees for two new reactors under construction at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia.
According to the DOE budget justification, ""USACE will continue to conduct cleanup of FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis."" Bill Status and Recent Funding History  Table 1 indicates the steps during consideration of FY2020 Energy and Water Development appropriations.
Table 2 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for FY2011 through FY2019, plus the FY2020 request.
Description of Major Energy and Water Programs The annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes four titles: Title I—Corps of Engineers—Civil; Title II—Department of the Interior (Central Utah Project and Bureau of Reclamation); Title III—Department of Energy; and Title IV—Independent Agencies, as shown in Table 3 .

Radiological activities at these sites are subject to oversight and recommendations by the independent Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, funded by Title IV of the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill."
19,Introduction This report provides background information for Congress on the levels of Department of Defense (DOD) military servicemembers and contractor personnel deployed in support of prior and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
20,"If no Member seeks recognition after the message is read, the Speaker will put the question of overriding the veto before the House by stating: The pending question is whether the House will, on reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding.
The House can agree by motion (or unanimous consent) to postpone the consideration of a veto message to a named day or to refer it to committee."
21,"The MAL program may be supplemented by a higher, second tier of revenue support comprised of two other programs: (1) the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, which provides price protection via statutory fixed ""reference"" prices for eligible crops, or (2) the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program, which provides revenue protection via historical moving average revenue guarantees based on the five most recent years of crop prices and yields.
However, several of them have been modified away from supply control and management of commodity stocks (which was designed to prop up prices) that directly linked support payments to farm production activities into decoupled revenue support that makes payments on historical program acres—referred to as base acres.
Base Acres B ase acres describes the historical planted acreage on each FSA farm using a multi-year average from as far back as the 1980s, for purposes of calculating program payments under one of the two revenue support programs—PLC or ARC.
For those farms that do participate, once a farm's base acres are enrolled in either ARC or PLC, the farm does not have to plant a particular program crop to be eligible for a program payment.
2014 Farm Bill: Updating Base Acres, Creation of Generic Base Because a farmer's actual plantings may differ from farm base acres, program payments may not necessarily align with financial losses associated with market prices or crop revenue.
The 2018 farm bill also added a provision (Section 1102(b)) regarding base-acre eligibility for ARC or PLC program payments.
Under current law, prior to loan maturity, producers may compare the repayment prices announced by USDA for their localities with the statutory MAL loan rates for each eligible commodity before selecting from among several potential MAL program benefits.
PLC and ARC provide income support to covered commodities at levels above the price protection offered by the MAL program's loan rates.
Payments under the PLC program are triggered when the national market-year average farm price (MYAP) for a covered commodity is below its ""effective reference price"" ( Figure 3 ).
Under the 2014 farm bill version of the PLC program, producers received payments on a portion of their enrolled base acres when the national MYAP for the enrolled covered commodity was below its reference price set in statute.
Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) Producers more concerned about declines in crop revenue (i.e., yield times price) than price can select the county ARC program (ARC-CO) as an alternative to PLC for each covered commodity.
Decoupled Payments Made on Base Acres A participating farmer does not have to plant or harvest a covered commodity to receive a PLC or ARC payment.
If ARC-CO or PLC program payments are triggered, then they are made on 85% of the producer's base acres that were enrolled for that covered commodity irrespective of actual plantings."
22,"This APA definition of ""rule"" encompasses a wide range of agency action, including certain agency statements that are not subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements outlined elsewhere in the APA: ""[R]ule"" means the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities, appliances, services or allowances therefor or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing on any of the foregoing[.] The CRA narrows this definition by providing that the term ""rule"" does not include (A) any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing; (B) any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or (C) any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.
applicability,"" have ""future effect,"" and be ""designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."" Second, even if an agency statement does qualify as an APA ""rule,"" the CRA expressly exempts three categories of rules from its provisions: rules ""of particular applicability,"" rules ""relating to agency management or personnel,"" and ""any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties."" Both inquiries are heavily fact specific, and require looking beyond a document's label to the substance of the agency's action.
""Rules"" under the APA An agency statement will qualify as a ""rule"" under the APA definition if it (1) is ""of general or particular applicability,"" (2) has ""future effect,"" and (3) is ""designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."" With regard to the first requirement, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) has noted, most agency statements will be ""of general or particular applicability"" and will fulfill this condition.
Second, and perhaps more critical, this case law reading ""future effect"" to mean that APA ""rules"" must bind the agency does not explain how to distinguish this requirement from the separate inquiry into whether an agency action is subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.
As discussed above, agency statements labeled as guidance are frequently exempt from the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures because they fall within the exceptions for interpretive rules or general policy statements.
This statement suggests that Congress intended the CRA to reach a broad range of agency activities, including agency policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain rules of agency organization, despite the fact that those actions are not subject to the APA's requirements for notice and comment.
CRA Exceptions Even if an agency action is a ""rule"" within the APA definition, it will not be subject to the CRA if it falls within one of the three exceptions to the CRA's definition of a ""rule."" The CRA incorporates the APA definition of rule, but exempts from that definition any rules ""of particular applicability,"" rules ""relating to agency management or personnel,"" and ""any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties."" Some of these exemptions track language in the APA, and accordingly, cases interpreting those APA provisions may be useful to interpret the CRA exceptions.
In opinions from GAO analyzing whether various agency actions fall within the particular-applicability exception, GAO has stated that to be generally applicable, the CRA does not require a rule to ""generally apply to the population as a whole."" Instead, ""all that is required is a finding"" that a rule ""has general applicability within its intended range, regardless of the magnitude of that range."" For example, in one case, GAO concluded that an agency decision adopting and implementing a plan to counter decreased river flows in a certain river basin was not a matter of particular applicability.
Although the decision applied to a specific geographic area, it would, in the view of GAO, nonetheless ""have significant economic and environmental impact throughout several major watersheds in the nation's largest state."" The CRA gives examples of some types of rules of particular applicability by specifying that this exemption includes any ""rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing."" Moreover, the post-enactment statement for the record written by the CRA's sponsors maintained that ""IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings are classic examples of rules of particular applicability."" Under the APA, courts have also held, for example, that agency actions designating specific sites as covered by environmental laws are rules of ""particular applicability."" Rules Relating to Agency Management or Personnel The second CRA exemption excludes ""any rule relating to agency management or personnel."" The APA contains a similar exemption from its general rulemaking requirements.
Specifically, Section 801(a)(1)(A) of the CRA requires the agency to submit a report containing a copy of the rule to each house of Congress and the Comptroller General; a concise general statement relating to the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and the proposed effective date of the rule.
For example, in an opinion it issued in 2012 regarding an action taken by the Department of Health and Human Services, GAO stated that ""We requested the views of the General Counsel of HHS on whether the July 12 Information Memorandum is a rule for purposes of the CRA by letter dated August 3, 2012.
GAO concluded that the information memorandum was a rule for the purposes of the CRA because it was a ""statement of general applicability and future effect, designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy with regard to TANF,"" and it did not fall within any of the three exceptions to the definition of a rule."
23,"Among other things, it allowed for enhanced sentencing of repeat federal sex offenders; mandated restitution to victims of specified federal sex offenses; and authorized grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women.
In addition, this VAWA reauthorization amended and authorized appropriations for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, enhanced measures to combat trafficking in persons, and amended VAWA grant purpose areas to include sex trafficking.
Moreover, P.L. 113-4 gave American Indian tribes authority to enforce tribal laws pertaining to domestic violence and related crimes against non-tribal members, and established a nondiscrimination provision for VAWA grant programs.
Violence Against Women Act of 1994 The Violence Against Women Act of 1994, among other things, (1) enhanced investigations and prosecutions of sex offenses; (2) provided for a number of grant programs to address the issue of violence against women from a variety of angles, including law enforcement, public and private entities and service providers, and victims of crime; and (3) established immigration provisions for abused aliens.
Grant Programs The original VAWA created a number of grant programs for a range of activities, including programs aimed at (1) preventing domestic violence and sexual assault; (2) encouraging collaboration among law enforcement, judicial personnel, and public/private sector providers with respect to services for victims of domestic violence and related crimes; (3) investigating and prosecuting domestic violence and related crimes; (4) encouraging states, tribes, and local governments to treat domestic violence as a serious crime and implement arrest policies; (5) bolstering investigations and prosecutions of domestic violence and child abuse in rural states; and (6) preventing crime in public transportation as well as public and national parks.
It additionally authorized grants for developing model programs for training of state and tribal judges and personnel on laws on rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, and other crimes of violence motivated by the victim's gender.
Other VAWA Requirements Beyond the criminal justice improvements, grant programs, and immigration provisions, VAWA included provisions for several other activities, including requiring that the U.S. Postal Service take measures to ensure confidentiality of domestic violence shelters' and abused persons' addresses; mandating federal research by the Attorney General, National Academy of Sciences, and Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the government's understanding of violence against women; and requesting special studies on campus sexual assault and battered women's syndrome.
Modifications included additional protections for battered nonimmigrants, a new program for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in need of transitional housing, a requirement for grant recipients to submit reports on the effectiveness of programs, new programs designed to protect elderly and disabled women, mandatory funds to be used exclusively for rape prevention and education programs, and inclusion of victims of dating violence.
VAWA 2013 added several new purpose areas to the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement of Protection Orders program (Arrest Program), one of which was to improve the criminal justice system response to immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.
These include, but are not limited to, improvements to data collection, assessing tribal jurisdiction over non-tribal members who commit VAWA-related crimes on tribal lands, new approaches for law enforcement in assisting victims, and enforcement of the federal prohibition on firearms for those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and those who are subject to a domestic violence protective order.
Tribal Jurisdiction As discussed previously, VAWA 2013 granted authority to American Indian tribes to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction and civil jurisdiction to issue and enforce protection orders over any person, including non-tribal members."
24,"Agricultural prices and U.S. exports of certain bulk commodities such as soybeans were further affected in 2018 by retaliatory tariffs imposed on selected U.S. agricultural imports by China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and Turkey.
The direction of the Administration's trade policy—for example, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with Japan and 10 other Pacific-facing nations and engaging in trade disputes with important agricultural trading partners that have resulted in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products—has coincided with market share losses for certain U.S. agricultural exports.
Status : The Administration's trade policy actions have in some cases resulted in retaliatory tariffs against U.S. agricultural product exports, while the status of new agreements with several important agricultural trading partners, such as Canada and Mexico, remains uncertain.
Canada, China, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey—whose exports were affected by the steel and aluminum tariffs—retaliated with tariffs on imports of a range of U.S. agricultural and food products and other goods.
The 2018 trade aid package includes (1) a Market Facilitation Program (MFP) of direct payments (valued at up to $10 billion) to producers of commodities most affected by the trade retaliation, (2) a Food Purchase and Distribution Program to partially offset lost export sales of affected commodities ($1.2 billion), and (3) an Agricultural Trade Promotion program to expand foreign markets ($200 million).
CPTPP countries represent a major component of U.S. farm and food trade, providing markets for 42% of U.S. farm exports between 2015 and 2018 while also supplying 52% of U.S. agricultural imports.
The combination of U.S. absence from CPTPP, retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm and food exports, and the possibility of the United States withdrawing entirely from NAFTA—as President Trump has threatened in the absence of USMCA ratification—could lead to a potential annual drop in U.S. agricultural exports of $21.8 billion, according to a study commissioned by the Farm Foundation.
Under NAFTA, all agricultural tariffs were phased out to zero except for certain products traded between the United States and Canada.
Under USMCA, market access would be expanded for the agricultural products traded between Canada and the United States that were exempt from tariff elimination under NAFTA.
Canada agreed to create new U.S.-specific TRQs for U.S. dairy products and to replace the existing NAFTA poultry TRQs with new USMCA TRQs. All U.S. exports within the set TRQ volume limit would be subject to zero tariffs rates, but U.S. over-quota exports would still face the higher levels of tariffs currently in place under Canada's WTO commitment.
Under USMCA, the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed to provide procedural safeguards for recognition of new geographic indications, which are place names used to identify products that come from certain regions or locations.
A study conducted by researchers at the International Monetary Fund assesses the potential impacts of USMCA on North America as a region taking into consideration the following provisions of the proposed USMCA: (1) higher vehicle and auto parts regional value content requirement; (2) new labor value content requirement for vehicles; (3) stricter rules of origin for USMCA textile and apparel trade; (4) agricultural trade liberalization that increases U.S. access to Canadian supply-managed markets and reduces U.S. barriers on Canadian dairy, sugar and sugar products, and peanuts and peanut products; and (5) trade facilitation measures.
Some policymakers have stated that the path to ratifying USMCA by Congress is uncertain, in part because the three countries have yet to resolve disputes over U.S. Section 232 tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum and over the retaliatory tariffs that Canada and Mexico have imposed on U.S. agricultural products.
As outlined in the side letter, Canada would modify certain measures that provide preferential grocery store shelf space to wines produced within the province and ""implement any changes no later than November 1, 2019.""  Other North American Trade Issues The proposed USMCA does not address all the issues that restrict U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada, nor does it include all of the changes sought by U.S. agricultural interest groups.
The suspension agreements limit Mexico's sugar exports to the United States to the residual of U.S. needs for domestic human use in a given marketing year after subtracting U.S. production and imports from other countries.
On the import side of the trade ledger, in March 2019, the United States initiated its review of the Generalized System of Preference (GSP), which provides duty-free tariff treatment for certain products imported from developing countries.
This has become a concern for U.S. agricultural exporters following a series of recently concluded trade agreements among the EU and Canada, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, and other countries that in many cases are also trading partners of the United States.
GIs continue to be a trade issue for USTR, and the United States is working ""to advance U.S. market access interests in foreign markets and to ensure that GI-related trade initiatives of the EU, its Member States, like-minded countries, and international organizations, do not undercut such market access,"" stating that the EU's GI agenda ""significantly undermines the scope of trademarks and other [intellectual property] rights held by U.S. producers and imposes barriers on market access for American-made goods that rely on the use of common names."" Previously, USDA officials have indicated that the United States would likely not agree to EU demands to reserve certain food names for EU producers and have expressed concerns about the EU's system of protections for GIs. GIs are also included in the United States' IPR negotiating objectives for the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Japan trade negotiations.
In late January 2019, the EC published a progress report confirming that its joint agenda does not include agriculture, since it ""is a sensitivity for the EU side."" The EU negotiating mandate states that a key EU goal is ""a trade agreement limited to the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods only, excluding agricultural products."" Separately, the EU has taken certain measures to avoid escalating agricultural trade tensions with the United States, for example, by increasing imports of U.S. soybeans as a source of biofuels and by proposing to lift a ban on certain pest-resistant American grapes in EU wine production, among other measures.
In response, the United States suspended trade concessions with the EU in 1999 by imposing retaliatory tariffs of 100% ad valorem on selected food products from EU countries.
Status: The United States continues to maintain that PRTs are a ""critical tool during meat processing that helps further the safety of products being placed on the market"" and continues to seek approval of certain PRTs for beef, pork, and poultry.
U.S. producers in the livestock sector look to the U.S. government to negotiate market access agreements, monitor international trading policies, and settle trade disputes, including restrictions that certain countries impose on U.S. exports in response to animal disease concerns.
The possibility that the United States could import poultry meat from China has alarmed some food safety advocates and some Members of Congress because of concerns about relatively lax food safety enforcement in China for both domestically consumed products and exports.
Fresh Beef Imports from Brazil and Argentina The United States restricts or prohibits the importation of animals or animal products (including meat) from countries where highly infectious animal diseases exist in order to protect U.S. herds.
In December 2015, the WTO authorized Canada and Mexico to retaliate against $1 billion worth of products imported from the United States.
Perhaps more relevant to U.S. agricultural trade is the concern that, because the United States plays such a prominent role in most international markets for agricultural products, any distortion resulting from U.S. policy would be both visible and potentially vulnerable to challenge under WTO rules.
Most recently, the WTO ruled in favor of the United States against China over Chinese domestic support policies for its agricultural sector and over China's administration of its market access policies."
25,"In the ensuing years, some observers raised concerns that the potential benefits of those regulatory changes (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, potentially higher economic growth over the long term) were outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., compliance costs incurred by banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, potentially slower economic growth).
This report provides a broad overview of selected banking-related issues, including issues related to ""safety and soundness"" regulation, consumer protection, community banks, large banks, what type of companies should be able to establish banks, and recent market and economic trends.
""Safety and Soundness"" Banks face a number of regulations intended to increase the likelihood that banks are profitable without being excessively risky and prone to failures; decrease the likelihood that bank services are used to conceal the proceeds of criminal activities; and to protect banks and their customers' data from cyberattacks.
This section provides background on these ""safety and soundness"" regulations and analyzes selected issues related to them, including prudential regulation related to capital requirements and the Volcker Rule (which restricts proprietary trading); requirements facing banks related to anti-money laundering laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act (P.L. 91-508); and challenges related to cybersecurity.
Whether the benefits of capital requirements (e.g., increased bank and financial system stability) are generally outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., reduced credit availability) is an issue subject to debate.
(Small or ""community"" bank compliance issues will be covered in more detail in the "" Regulatory Burden on Community Banks "" section later in the report.) Section 201 of the EGRRCP Act is aimed at addressing concerns over the complexity of risk-weighted ratios and the costs they impose on community banks.
Bank regulators have issued a proposal to implement this provision wherein banks (1) below the threshold that (2) meet at least a 9% leverage ratio measure of equity and certain retained earnings to assets and (3) had limited off-balance sheet exposures and limited securities trading activity (among other requirements) would qualify for the exemption.
Debates relating to the efficiency of the Volcker Rule involve its complexity, compliance burden, and potential to lead banks to reduce their engagement in beneficial market activities.
Despite robust AML efforts in the United States, the ability to counter money laundering effectively remains challenged by factors including (1) the diversity of illicit methods to move and store ill-gotten proceeds through the international financial system; (2) the introduction of new and emerging threats such as cyber-related financial crimes; (3) gaps in legal, regulatory, and enforcement regimes; and (4) the costs associated with financial institution compliance with global AML guidance and national laws.
The section also analyzes related issues, including whether the CFPB has used its authorities and regulations of banking institutions appropriately; concerns relating to the lack of consumer access to banking services; and whether the Community Reinvestment Act as currently implemented is effectively and efficiently meeting its goal of ensuring banks provide credit to the areas in which they operate.
Recently, banks and other nonbank financial institutions that provide financial products to consumers (e.g., mortgages, credit cards, and deposit accounts) have been affected by the implementation of new CFPB regulations.
In addition to these and other new regulations, the CFPB also provides information on its supervisory activities related to banks, such as instances where its examiners found that certain financial institutions misrepresented service fees associated with deposit and checking accounts.
Compliance with these new rules has increased banks' operational costs, which some argue potentially leads to higher costs for consumers in certain markets or a reduction in the availability of credit.
In response to the crisis, policymakers took a number of steps through the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Accords to eliminate the TBTF problem, including subjecting the largest banks to enhanced prudential regulations, a new resolution regime to unwind these banks in the event of failure, and higher capital requirements.
These changes include exemptions from the Volcker Rule and risk-weighted capital requirements for banks with less than $10 billion in assets (meeting certain criteria).
Currently, these requirements raise a number of policy questions, including whether companies established primarily as financial technology companies should be able to receive a national bank charter, as has been offered by the OCC; and whether the application process and determinations made by the FDIC as they relate to institutions seeking a specific type of state charter, called an industrial loan company (ILC) charter, is overly restrictive.
The OCC stated that fintech firms granted the charter ""will be subject to the same high standards of safety and soundness and fairness that all federally chartered banks must meet,"" and also that the OCC ""may need to account for differences in business models and activities, risks, and the inapplicability of certain laws resulting from the uninsured status of the bank."" Thus, the argument goes, establishing a fintech charter would mean a new set of innovative companies would no longer face regulatory uncertainty and could safely and efficiently provide beneficial financial services, perhaps to populations and market-niches that banks with traditional cost structures do not find cost-effective to serve.
Given the interest in and debate surrounding this charter type, policymakers will likely examine questions over the extent to which ILCs create innovative sources of credit and financial services subject to appropriate safeguards or inadvisably allow commercial organizations to act as banks with federal safety nets while exempting them from certain bank regulation and supervision."
26,"The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals.
These requirements include the following: The proposed vehicle must be able to self-deploy from amphibious shipping and deliver a reinforced Marine infantry squad (17 marines) from a launch distance at or beyond 12 miles with a speed of not less than 8 knots in seas with 1-foot significant wave height and must be able to operate in seas up to 3-foot significant wave height.
These requirements included the following: The vehicle must accommodate nine marines and two crew members and have a ""robust tactical swim capability (shore-to-shore [not designed to embark from an amphibious ship]) and be capable of operating at 6 knots in a fully developed sea."" The vehicle must be able to operate on land with M-1A1s in mechanized task forces across the Marine Corps' mission profile.
In terms of Marine Corps amphibious assault operations, the adoption of EABO could reportedly result in ""an entirely different approach to amphibious assaults as well as new weapon systems."" Noting that ""missiles can now hit ships and landing craft while they are hundreds of miles from shore, making it far too dangerous for Marines to storm a beach with current capabilities,"" Marine officials are reportedly exploring ways to create temporary ""bubbles"" where Marines can get ashore.
Plans are to equip six battalions with ACV 1.1s and 392 existing upgraded AAVs. Both BAE and SAIC reportedly have a long history related to amphibious vehicles, as BAE built the Marines' original AAV and SAIC has built hundreds of Terrex 1 vehicles used by Singapore, and both companies had Marine Corps contracts to modernize AAVs. ACV 1.1 is intended to have some amphibious capability but would rely on ship-to-shore connectors."
27,"At the beginning of the 116 th Congress, the House adopted a standing rule that would provide for legislation suspending the statutory debt limit to be considered as passed by the House, without a separate vote, when the House adopts the budget resolution for a fiscal year.
Features of the House Debt Limit Rule House Rule XXVIII requires that the House clerk, when the House adopts the budget resolution for a fiscal year, automatically engross and transmit to the Senate a joint resolution suspending the public debt limit through the end of that year.
Operation of the Gephardt Rule  Table 1 provides information on the joint resolutions changing the public debt limit that were engrossed and deemed passed by the House pursuant to the Gephardt rule during calendar years 1980-2010."
28,"Other issues relate to access, including alternatives to on-site consumption in summer meals and implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision, an option to provide free meals to all students in certain schools.
Specifically, the law required USDA to issue proposed regulations for competitive foods nutrition standards within one year after enactment and for school meals nutrition standards within 18 months after enactment.
For example, the House-passed version of 2018 farm bill (one version of H.R. 2 ) would have required USDA to review and revise the nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods.
According to the bill, the revisions would have had to ensure that the standards, particularly those related to milk, ""(1) are based on research based on school-age children; (2) do not add costs in addition to the reimbursements required to carry out the school lunch program … and (3) maintain healthy meals for students."" This provision was not included in the enacted bill.
The House committee's proposal ( H.R. 5003 ) would have required USDA to review the school meal standards at least once every three years and revise them as necessary, following certain criteria.
Although not included in the proposal itself, negotiations between the Senate committee, the White House, USDA, and the School Nutrition Association resulted in an agreement that these revisions, if enacted, would have reduced the 100% whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delayed the Target 2 sodium requirement for two years.
In the 114 th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation in the House ( H.R. 5003 ) included a similar proposal to allow participating schools to serve ""all forms"" of fruits and vegetables as well as tree nuts."
29,"Dollar amounts come from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Foreign Aid Explorer database (Explorer) and annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations acts.
In its broadest sense, U.S. foreign aid is defined under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), the primary legislative basis of foreign aid programs, as  any tangible or intangible item provided by the United States Government [including ""by means of gift, loan, sale, credit, or guaranty""] to a foreign country or international organization under this or any other Act, including but not limited to any training, service, or technical advice, any item of real, personal, or mixed property, any agricultural commodity, United States dollars, and any currencies of any foreign country which are owned by the United States Government....
Growing participation by DOD in health and humanitarian efforts and expansion of health programs in developing countries by the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, especially in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, followed.
During the past 15 years, DOD-funded and implemented aid programs in Iraq and Afghanistan to train and equip foreign forces and win hearts and minds through development efforts were often considerably larger than the traditional military and development assistance programs provided under the foreign operations appropriations.
However, since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, policymakers frequently have cast foreign assistance as a tool in U.S. counterterrorism strategy, increasing aid to partner states in counterterrorism efforts and funding the substantial reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In 2006, in an effort to rationalize the assistance program more clearly, the State Department developed a framework that organizes U.S. foreign aid around five strategic objectives, each of which includes a number of program elements, also known as sectors.
This methodology reflects the organization of aid accounts within the SFOPS appropriations but can easily be applied to the international food aid title of the Agriculture appropriations as well as to the DOD and other government agency assistance programs with funding outside traditional foreign aid budget accounts.
Bilateral Development Assistance For FY2017, U.S. government departments and agencies obligated about $16.2 billion in bilateral development assistance, or 33% of total foreign aid, primarily through the Development Assistance (DA) and Global Health (Global Health-USAID and Global Health-State) accounts and the administrative accounts that allow USAID to operate (Operating Expenses, Capital Investment Fund, and Office of the Inspector General).
For FY2017, the U.S. government obligated $2.1 billion for development activities managed by international organizations and financial institutions, including contributions to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); the United Nations Development Program (UNDP); and MDBs, such as the World Bank.
In addition, the State Department, through its Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, has policy authority over the Foreign Military Financing (FMF), International Military Education and Training (IMET), and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) accounts, and, while it was active, the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF).
Aid is also provided in the form of core contribution to international organizations such as the United Nations, technical assistance, and direct budget support (cash transfer) to governments.
The Obama Administration's FY2012 international affairs budget proposed that the overseas contingency operations (OCO) designation, which had been applied since 2009 to war-related Defense appropriations, including to DOD assistance programs such as ISFF, ASFF and CERP, be extended to include ""extraordinary, but temporary, costs of the Department of State and USAID in the front line states of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Congress not only adopted the OCO designation in the FY2012 SFOPS appropriations legislation, but expanded it to include funding for additional accounts and countries.
Congress appropriated significant emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations and Defense assistance programs every year from FY2002 through FY2010 for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, which were not counted toward subcommittee budget allocations.
However, an estimated 32% of U.S. bilateral development assistance was tied in 2016, the highest percentage among major donors, perhaps reflecting the perception of policymakers that maintaining public and political support for foreign aid programs requires ensuring direct economic benefit to the United States."
30,"Overview The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ) to provide an incentive for the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
These federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects via a competitive application process administered by state housing finance authorities (HFAs).
Instead, the credit rates have fluctuated in response to market interest movements so that the program has delivered a subsidy equal to 30% of the present value of a project's qualified basis in the case of the 4% credit, and 70% in the case of the 9% credit."
31,"Most Social Security beneficiaries are retired or disabled workers, whose monthly benefits depend on their past earnings, their age, and other factors.
That is done by increasing each year of a worker's taxable earnings after 1950 by the growth in average earnings in the economy, as measured by the national average wage index, from the year of work until two years before eligibility for benefits, which for retired workers is at 62.
How Timing of Benefit Claim Affects Benefit Levels Full Retirement Age The full retirement age (FRA, also called the normal retirement age) is the age at which a worker can receive the full PIA, increased by any COLAs. The FRA was 65 for people born before 1938, but the Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ) raised the FRA for those born later, as shown in Table 2 ."
32,"While local emissions of ozone precursors are still the dominant source of ozone in many areas, state and local air quality agencies face ozone pollution arising from sources outside of their jurisdictional control (""background ozone"").
Current research suggests that natural sources and sources outside the United States may contribute to total ozone in those areas at certain times.
Ozone forms naturally in the lower levels of the atmosphere due to natural emissions of precursors from sources including lightning, vegetation, wildfires, and methane.
In the publication of the most recent NAAQS for ozone, EPA generically defined background ozone as USB: The term ""background"" O 3 is often used to refer to O 3 that originates from natural sources of O 3 ( e.g., wildfires and stratospheric O 3 intrusions) and O 3 precursors, as well as from man-made international emissions of O 3 precursors.
The lack of a decreasing ozone trend at many monitors in the West could be due to a number of causes: increasing seasonal average temperatures, an increase in incidents of fire since 1986, emissions from oil and gas development, increasing contributions from international transport of air pollution, and increasing global methane concentrations."
33,"The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952, as amended, provides for the granting of asylum to an alien who applies for such relief in accordance with applicable requirements and is determined to be a refugee .
If the asylum officer determines than an applicant is not eligible for asylum and the applicant appears to be inadmissible or deportable under the INA, however, DHS regulations direct the officer to refer the case to an immigration judge for adjudication in removal proceedings.
Under the INA, an individual who is determined by DHS to be inadmissible to the United States because he or she lacks proper documentation or has committed fraud or willful misrepresentation of facts to obtain documentation or another immigration benefit (and thus is subject to expedited removal) and expresses the intent to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution is to be interviewed by an asylum officer to determine if he or she has a credible fear of persecution.
Specifically, the Convention prohibited states from expelling or returning a refugee ""to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."" In the 1970s, INS issued regulations that established procedures for applying for asylum in the United States and for adjudicating asylum applications.
The first directed the Attorney General to establish asylum application procedures for aliens physically present in the United States or arriving at a land border or port of entry, regardless of immigration status, and gave the Attorney General discretionary authority to grant asylum to aliens who met the newly added INA definition of a refugee.
The asylee provisions granted the Attorney General discretionary authority to adjust the status of an alien who had been physically present in the United States for one year after being granted asylum and met other requirements, subject to an annual numerical limit of 5,000.
The INA provision in effect prior to the enactment of the Refugee Act ""authorized"" the Attorney General to withhold the deportation of an alien in the United States (other than an alien involved in Nazi-related activity) to ""any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion or political opinion."" The Refugee Act revised this language to prohibit the Attorney General from deporting or returning any alien to a country where the Attorney General determines the alien's life or freedom would be threatened because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.
The district director would deny an asylum application for various reasons, including that the alien had been firmly resettled in another country; the alien had participated in the persecution of another person based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; the alien had been convicted of a ""particularly serious crime"" and thus was a danger to the United States; there existed ""serious reasons for considering that the alien had committed a serious non-political crime outside the United States;"" or there existed ""reasonable grounds"" for considering the alien a danger to national security.
Regarding eligibility for withholding of deportation, the 1990 rule stated, in part, ""The applicant's life or freedom shall be found to be threatened if it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."" The 1990 rule directed the asylum officer to grant an undetained asylum applicant employment authorization for up to one year if the officer determined that the application was not frivolous; frivolous was defined as ""manifestly unfounded or abusive."" The employment authorization could be renewed in increments of up to one year.
Asylum Provisions IIRIRA added restrictions to the general policy set forth in the 1980 Refugee Act and incorporated into the INA that an alien who is present in the United States or who arrives in the United States, regardless of immigration status, can apply for asylum.
In general, under the IIRIRA amendments, which remain in effect, an alien is not eligible to apply for asylum unless the alien can show that he or she filed the application within one year of arriving in the United States.
Among other new asylum provisions it added to the INA were a requirement to check the identity of applicants against ""all appropriate records or databases maintained by the Attorney General and by the Secretary of State"" and a permanent bar to receiving any immigration benefits for aliens who knowingly file frivolous asylum applications after being notified of the consequences for doing so.
) It also could be applied to any (or all) aliens in the United States, as designated by the Attorney General at his or her discretion, if an alien has not been admitted or paroled into the United States and ""has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility."" Using this statutory authority, the application of expedited removal has been expanded to classes of aliens beyond arriving aliens (see "" Implementing Regulations "").
(Special procedures apply to aliens arriving in the United States at a U.S.-Canada land port of entry in accordance with a U.S.-Canada agreement; see "" Safe Third Country Agreements ."") Under the INA, credible fear of persecution means that ""there is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum."" If an alien is found to have a credible fear, the asylum officer is to refer the case to an immigration judge for full consideration of the asylum request during standard removal proceedings.
If the asylum officer makes an affirmative credible fear finding, the officer is to refer the case to an immigration judge for full consideration of the CAT application during standard removal proceedings.
It estimated that for the May 2007-FY2014 period since its 2008 report, ""the affirmative and defensive asylum grant rates would vary by 47 and 57 percentage points, respectively, for the same representative applicant whose case was heard by different immigration judges."" Safe Third Country Agreements Under the INA, an alien is ineligible to apply for asylum in the United States if he or she can be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a third country where the ""alien's life or freedom would not be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and where the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection.""  The United States and Canada signed a safe third country agreement in 2002, which went into effect in 2004.
Under DHS regulations, a USCIS asylum officer must determine whether an alien arriving in the United States at a U.S.-Canada land border port of entry seeking asylum is subject to removal to Canada in accordance with the U.S.-Canada safe third country agreement."
34,"Five months into his six-year term, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador enjoys an approval ratings of 78%, even as his government is struggling to address rising insecurity and sluggish growth.
This report provides an overview of political and economic conditions in Mexico, followed by assessments of selected issues of congressional interest in Mexico: security and foreign aid, extraditions, human rights, trade, migration, energy, education, environment, and water issues.
Partially as a result of these new constraints on executive power, the country's first two presidents from the conservative National Action Party (PAN)—Vicente Fox (2000-2006) and Felipe Calderón (2006-2012)—struggled to enact some of the reforms designed to address Mexico's economic and security challenges.
With López Obrador's support, the Congress has enacted reforms to strengthen the protection of labor rights and workers' salaries, in part to comply with its domestic commitments related to the USMCA.
Even as many groups have developed into multifaceted illicit enterprises, government efforts to seize criminal assets have been modest and attempts to prosecute money laundering cases have had ""significant shortcomings."" With violence reaching historic levels during the first quarter of 2019 and high-profile massacres occurring, President López Obrador is under increasing pressure to refine his security strategy.
As a candidate, López Obrador emphasized anticorruption initiatives, social investments, human rights, drug policy reform, and transitional justice for nonviolent criminals.
Corruption, Impunity, and Human Rights Abuses Corruption and the Rule of Law  Corruption is an issue at all levels of government in Mexico: 84% of Mexicans identify corruption as among the most pressing challenge facing the country.
For years, human rights groups and U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices have chronicled cases of Mexican security officials' involvement in extrajudicial killings, ""enforced disappearances,"" and torture.
During a recent visit to Mexico, Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recognized President López Obrador's efforts to put human rights at the center of his government.
In December 2018, López Obrador announced a plan to invest some $25 billion in southern Mexico to accompany an estimated $4.8 billion in potential U.S. public and private investments to promote job growth, infrastructure, and development in that region, including jobs for Central American migrants.
In 2011, the U.S. and Mexican governments agreed to a revised four-pillar strategy that prioritized (1) combating transnational criminal organizations through intelligence sharing and law enforcement operations; (2) institutionalizing the rule of law while protecting human rights through justice sector reform and forensic assistance; (3) creating a ""21 st century border"" while improving immigration enforcement in Mexico; and (4) building strong and resilient communities with pilot programs to address the root causes of violence and reduce drug demand.
From FY2008 to FY2015, Congress made conditional 15% of U.S. assistance to the Mexican military and police until the State Department sent a report to appropriators verifying that Mexico was taking steps to comply with certain human rights standards.
U.S. assistance to Mexico has supported the Mexican government's efforts to reform its judicial system and to improve human rights conditions in the country.
Since the mid-2000s, successive Mexican governments have supported efforts to enact immigration reform in the United States, while being careful not to appear to be infringing upon U.S. authority to make and enforce immigration laws.
The Mexican government expressed regret after the Administration's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, which has provided work authorization and relief from removal for migrants brought to the United States as children, but pledged to assist DACA beneficiaries who return to Mexico.
As a result, the profile of Mexican deportees now include more individuals who have spent many decades in the United States than in recent years (when the Obama Administration had focused on recent border crossers and those with criminal records).
The López Obrador administration has provided humanitarian relief to Central American migrants in Mexico, but not increased funding for the migration agency or asylum system.
Under pressure from the United States and with its migration stations overcapacity, the Mexican government has recently limited protections and increased deportations, particularly for those traveling in large groups or caravans, to discourage future flows.
As an example, President Trump has recently threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border or to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican motor vehicle exports to the United States if the Mexican government does not increase its efforts to stop U.S.-bound migrants over the coming year.
Opportunities exist for continued U.S.-Mexican energy cooperation in the hydrocarbons sector, but the future of those efforts may depend on the policies of the López Obrador government."

Prior to the conclusion of a final bilateral agreement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified Mexico that it would implement a new policy under Section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to return some non-Mexican asylum seekers (excluding unaccompanied minors) to Mexico to await their immigration court decisions.

38,"Introduction On a daily basis, the restaurants, cafeterias, and carryout facilities operated by the House of Representatives and the Senate serve Members of Congress, congressional employees, constituents, and other visitors to the Capitol, House office buildings, and Senate office buildings.
All the House food service facilities, including the vending machines, are required to accept all major credit and debit cards, and many vending machines also accept Apple Pay and Google Pay. Additional ""pop-up"" lunch options in the O'Neill House Office Building main lobby operate through a partnership with Fooda on certain weekdays, featuring foods from local restaurants.
Senate Restaurant System Operations Present Vendor and Oversight for Senate Restaurants Since 2008, food services in the Senate have been provided by a private contractor, under the jurisdiction of the AOC and subject to policy directives from the Committee on Rules and Administration.
When the current vendor, Sodexo, was selected for the House restaurants, the CAO acknowledged that providing quick dining options was a main priority for the restaurant service, although the quality of food, nutrition, and customer service were also considerations.
The CAO noted that its office shares the ""understandable desire to ensure that the people who provide services to the House are compensated fairly,"" and indicated that the new House vendor was chosen, in part, based on ""the signals that Sodexo sent regarding the value it places on a strong, effective, fairly compensated workforce."" When Sodexo took over the House restaurants in August 2015, it announced plans to voluntarily follow the D.C. Displaced Workers Protection Act of 1994, which guaranteed that no employees would be laid off for at least 90 days after the contractor change.
The House and Senate restaurants are operated by private food service contractors who handle most of the day-to-day concerns."
39,"Introduction The Trump Administration's Nuclear Posture Review, released on February 2, 2018, includes plans for the United States to deploy two new types of nuclear weapons ""to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of U.S. nuclear forces."" The report highlights that these weapons represent a response to Russia's deployment of a much larger stockpile of lower-yield nonstrategic nuclear weapons and to Russia's apparent belief ""that limited nuclear first use, potentially including low yield weapons"" can provide ""a coercive advantage in crises and at lower levels of conflict."" The two capabilities identified in the NPR are a new low-yield nuclear warhead to be deployed on U.S. long-range submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a new sea-launched cruise missile that could be deployed on Navy ships or attack submarines.
The report states that the United States does not need to deploy ""non-strategic nuclear capabilities that quantitatively match or mimic Russia's more expansive arsenal."" But it indicates that ""expanding flexible U.S. nuclear options now, to include low yield options, is important for the preservation of credible deterrence against regional aggression."" The NPR's recommended deployment of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons follows growing concerns, both in Congress and among analysts outside of government, about new nuclear challenges facing the United States.
During the Senate debate on the 2010 U.S.-Russian Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), many Members noted that this treaty did not impose any limits on nonstrategic nuclear weapons and that Russia possessed a far greater number of these systems than did the United States.
In response to these concerns, the Senate, in its Resolution of Ratification on New START, stated that the United States should seek to initiate within one year, ""negotiations with the Russian Federation on an agreement to address the disparity between the non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation and of the United States and to secure and reduce tactical nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner."" In addition, in the FY2013 Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 4310 , §1037), Congress again indicated that ""the United States should pursue negotiations with the Russian Federation aimed at the reduction of Russian deployed and nondeployed nonstrategic nuclear forces."" Although the United States did raise the issue of negotiations on nonstrategic nuclear weapons with Russia within the year after New START entered into force, the two nations have not moved forward with efforts to negotiate limits on these weapons.
They included among these steps a call for nations to eliminate ""short-range nuclear weapons designed to be forward-deployed."" In a subsequent article published in January 2008, they elaborated on this step, calling for ""a dialogue, including within NATO and with Russia, on consolidating the nuclear weapons designed for forward deployment to enhance their security, as a first step toward careful accounting for them and their eventual elimination."" They noted, specifically, that ""these smaller and more portable nuclear weapons are, given their characteristics, inviting acquisition targets for terrorist groups."" In addition, as a part of its renewed interest in the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy, Congress established, in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Bill ( P.L. 110-181 §1062), a Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States.
Specifically, the allies reiterated that ""as long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance"" and that ""the strategic forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of the Allies."" At the same time, they noted that ""NATO's nuclear deterrence posture also relies, in part, on United States' nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and on capabilities and infrastructure provided by Allies concerned."" At the same time, NATO has begun to implement numerous initiatives in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine and aggressive posture toward Europe.
Like the Strategic Posture Commission Report published in 2009, the NPR highlights the imbalance in the numbers of U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons and states that Russia has increased its reliance on these weapons in its national security strategy.
The 2018 NPR also echoes the Obama Administration's NPR, indicating that the United States will maintain ""the capability to forward deploy nuclear bombers and DCA around the world."" It also states that the United States will continue Obama-era programs to communicate with and consult allies ""on policy, strategy and capabilities."" The 2018 NPR also supports of the recent changes in NATO's approach to nuclear modernization and planning, indicating that the United States is ""committed to upgrading DCA [dual capable aircraft] with the nuclear-capable F-35 aircraft"" and that the United States will ""work with NATO to best ensure—and improve where needed—the readiness, survivability, and operational effectiveness of DCA based in Europe."" However, while the 2010 NPR called for the retirement of U.S. Tomahawk nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles (TLAMN), the 2018 NPR calls for the development of a new sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM).
As the Cold War drew to a close, NATO acknowledged that it would no longer maintain nuclear weapons to deter or defeat a conventional attack from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact because ""the threat of a simultaneous, full-scale attack on all of NATO's European fronts has effectively been removed."" But NATO documents indicated that these weapons would still play an important political role in NATO's strategy by ensuring ""uncertainty in the mind of any potential aggressor about the nature of the Allies' response to military aggression."" Force Structure Throughout the Cold War, the United States often altered the size and structure of its nonstrategic nuclear forces in response to changing capabilities and changing threat assessments.
The document noted that the allies are ""resolved to seek a safer world for all and to create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons in accordance with the goals of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, in a way that promotes international stability, and is based on the principle of undiminished security for all."" It also noted that the alliance had ""dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe"" and had reduced the role of nuclear weapons in NATO strategy."" The allies pledged to ""seek to create the conditions for further reductions in the future."" The Strategic Concept indicated that the goal in these reductions should be to ""seek Russian agreement to increase transparency on its nuclear weapons in Europe and relocate these weapons away from the territory of NATO members."" Moreover, the document noted that this arms control process ""must take into account the disparity with the greater Russian stockpiles of short-range nuclear weapons."" Hence, even though NATO no longer viewed Russia as an adversary, the allies apparently agreed that the disparity in nonstrategic nuclear weapons could create security concerns for some members of the alliance.
It indicated that ""the strategic forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of the Allies"" and that ""the independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and contribute to the overall security of the Alliance."" Moreover, the allies reaffirmed that ""NATO's nuclear deterrence posture also relies, in part, on United States' nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and on capabilities and infrastructure provided by Allies concerned."" In addition, in response to concerns about Russian nuclear doctrine, the statement emphasized that ""any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict"" and, ""if the fundamental security of any of its members were to be threatened however, NATO has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that an adversary could hope to achieve."" On the other hand, the Warsaw Summit Communique recognized the strains on the arms control relationship with Russia.
Where the 2012 DDPR had called for discussions with Russia on transparency and confidence-building and indicated that NATO would consider negotiating reductions in forward-based forces, the 2016 Warsaw statement simply noted that ""arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation continue to play an important role in the achievement of the Alliance's security objectives."" It then stated that, ""in this context, it is of paramount importance that disarmament and non-proliferation commitments under existing treaties are honoured ...
In several places, the allies noted that the changing security environment necessitated efforts to bolster the deterrence ""as a core element"" of the alliance's collective defense and noted that credible deterrence ""will continue to be based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defence capabilities."" It also stated that a ""robust deterrence and defence posture strengthens Alliance cohesion and provides an essential political and military transatlantic link, through an equitable and sustainable distribution of roles, responsibilities, and burdens.""  At the same time, the 2018 communique went further in highlighting the allies' concerns with Russia's violation of the INF Treaty.
Moreover, the possible use of nuclear weapons, and extended nuclear deterrence, were a part of a broader concept that the Obama Administration referred to as ""regional security architectures."" The 2010 NPR indicated that regional security architectures were a key part of ""the U.S. strategy for strengthening regional deterrence while reducing the role and numbers of nuclear weapons."" As a result, these architectures would ""include effective missile defense, counter-WMD capabilities, conventional power-projection capabilities, and integrated command and control—all underwritten by strong political commitments."" In other words, although the United States would continue to extend deterrence to its allies and seek to assure them of the U.S. commitment to their security, it would draw on political commitments and a range of military capabilities to achieve these goals.
For example, former Secretary of Defense Perry stated, during the Clinton Administration, that ""maintaining U.S. nuclear commitments with NATO, and retaining the ability to deploy nuclear capabilities to meet various regional contingencies , continues to be an important means for deterring aggression, protecting and promoting U.S. interests, reassuring allies and friends, and preventing proliferation (emphasis added).""  Specifically, both during the Cold War and after the demise of the Soviet Union, the United States maintained the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks with conventional, chemical, or biological weapons.
The very existence of U.S. strategic and theater nuclear forces, backed by highly capable conventional forces, should certainly give pause to any rogue leader contemplating the use of WMD against the United States, its overseas deployed forces, or its allies."" These statements do not indicate whether nonstrategic nuclear weapons would be used to achieve battlefield or tactical objectives, or whether they would contribute to strategic missions, but it remained evident, throughout the 1990s, that the United States continued to view these weapons as a part of its national security strategy.
It indicates that the United States will ""maintain, and enhance as necessary, the capability to forward deploy nuclear bombers and DCA around the world"" and will ""work with NATO to best ensure—and improve where needed—the readiness, survivability, and operational effectiveness of DCA based in Europe."" The 2018 NPR also reinforces U.S. support for measures that NATO is taking to ensure that its ""overall deterrence and defense posture, including its nuclear forces, remain capable of addressing any potential adversary's doctrine and capabilities."" These measures include, among other things, enhancing ""the readiness and survivability of NATO DCA"" and improving the ""capabilities required to increase their operational effectiveness""; promoting ""the broadest possible participation of Allies in their agreed burden sharing arrangements""; and enhancing ""the realism of training and exercise programs to ensure the Alliance can effectively integrate nuclear and non-nuclear operations."" On the other hand, the 2018 NPR reverses the Obama Administration's decision to remove sea-launched cruise missiles from the U.S. force structure.
The NPR also indicates that a new SLCM program could serve as a response to Russia's violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and a ""necessary incentive for Russia to negotiate seriously a reduction of its non-strategic nuclear weapons.""  Russian Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons after the Cold War Strategy and Doctrine Russia has altered and adjusted the Soviet nuclear strategy to meet its new circumstances in a post-Cold War world.
The 112 th Congress reiterated its support for this agenda, when in the FY2013 Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 4310 , §1037) it indicated that ""the United States should pursue negotiations with the Russian Federation aimed at the reduction of Russian deployed and nondeployed nonstrategic nuclear forces.""  But the tone of the discussion has changed in recent years, following Russia's annexation of Crimea, its support for separatists in Ukraine, and its military maneuvers near NATO nations.
It noted that Russia ""stores thousands of these weapons in apparent support of possible military operations west of the Urals."" It further noted that the current imbalance between U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear warheads is ""worrisome to some U.S. allies in Central Europe."" It argued that this imbalance, and the allies' worries, could become more pronounced in the future if the United States and Russia continue to reduce their numbers of deployed strategic nuclear weapons.
The Role of Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons in NATO Policy and Alliance Strategy For years after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and demise of the Soviet Union, analysts questioned whether the United States needed to continue to deploy nuclear weapons in Europe.
Those who sought the weapons' removal also argued that NATO could meet the political goals of shared nuclear responsibility in other ways, and that the United States could extend deterrence and ensure the security of its allies in Europe with conventional weapons, missile defenses, and longer-range strategic nuclear weapons."
40,"ED's OCR consequently enforces the regulations implementing both Section 504 and Title II of the ADA consistently with the ADA Amendments Act. Preschool Through Secondary Education Versus Postsecondary Education The IDEA covers all children with disabilities residing in states that receive financial assistance under the act.
Evaluation and Placement Evaluations in Preschool, Elementary, and Secondary Education Child Find The IDEA requires each state that receives funds under the act to have in place policies and procedures to identify, locate, and evaluate all children residing in the state who may have a disability requiring special education and related services.
The regulations implementing Section 504 contain similar provisions requiring recipients of federal money operating public elementary and secondary schools ""to identify and locate every qualified handicapped person residing in the recipient's jurisdiction who is not receiving a public education."" Section 504's regulations also require LEAs to evaluate students individually before classifying them as having a disability or providing them with accommodations, special education, or related services.
Even though schools may have eligibility requirements for such courses, ED has concluded that both sets of regulations make it ""unlawful to deny a student with a disability admission to an accelerated class or program solely because of that student's need for special education or related aids and services."" Private School Placements Because the IDEA is designed to improve the education of all children with qualifying disabilities, the act also provides benefits and services to eligible children enrolled by their parents in private school.
Adaptations, Accommodations, and Services Preschool, Elementary, and Secondary Education To receive services under the IDEA, a child must be evaluated and found eligible for an IEP under one of the IDEA disability categories and must because of that disability require special education and related services to benefit from public education.
As part of their right to a FAPE, each child receiving services under the IDEA must have an IEP stating the specific special education and related services the LEA will provide to meet his or her needs.
Unlike the IDEA, an ""appropriate education"" under Section 504 regulation is defined as the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services designed to meet individual educational needs of children with disabilities as adequately as the needs of children without disabilities are met and that comply with procedural requirements."
41,"In other words, the FTCA ""makes the remedy against the United States under the FTCA exclusive"" of ""any other civil action or proceeding for money damages"" that might otherwise be available ""against the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim."" Congress prohibited courts from holding federal employees personally liable for torts committed within the scope of their employment in order to avert what Congress perceived as ""an immediate crisis involving the prospect of personal liability and the threat of protracted personal tort litigation for the entire Federal workforce."" Critically, the individual employee generally remains immune from tort liability for torts committed within the scope of his employment even if a provision of the FTCA forecloses the plaintiff from recovering monetary damages from the United States itself.
By contrast, courts have generally held that because physicians who provide medical services at facilities operated by the United States often operate relatively independently of the federal government's control, such physicians ordinarily qualify as ""independent contractors, and not employees of the government for FTCA purposes.""  The Boyle Rule Because the FTCA's prohibition against suits by individual employees does not insulate independent contractors from liability, a plaintiff injured by the tortious action of an independent contractor working for the federal government may potentially be able to recover compensation directly from that contractor.
engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment."" By creating a mechanism by which the United States may substitute itself as the defendant in the individual employee's place, the FTCA effectively ""immunize[s] covered federal employees not simply from liability, but from suit."" In this way, the FTCA ""relieve[s] covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit"" and instead places ""those burdens on the Government's shoulders."" In some cases, the Attorney General's decision to substitute the United States in the officer's place may adversely affect the plaintiff's chances of prevailing on his claims.
Generally speaking, once the Attorney General certifies that the federal employee was acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the allegedly tortious act, ""the FTCA's requirements, exceptions, and defenses apply to the suit."" Depending on the circumstances, those requirements, exceptions, and defenses can ""absolutely bar [the] plaintiff's case"" against the United States, as explained in greater detail below.
Thus, under certain circumstances, the FTCA will shield both the United States and its employees from liability for its tortious actions, thereby effectively ""leav[ing] certain tort victims without any remedy.""  ""In such cases, to try to preserve their lawsuits"" against the federal employee, the plaintiff may attempt to ""contest the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification."" That is, the plaintiff may argue that the government employee defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment, such that the suit should therefore proceed against the government official in his personal capacity.
or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty""; ""Any claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter""; certain claims arising from the actions of law enforcement officers administering customs and excise laws; certain admiralty claims against the United States for which federal law provides an alternative remedy; claims ""arising out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering"" certain provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917; ""Any claim for damages caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States""; certain claims predicated upon intentional torts committed by federal employees; ""Any claim for damages caused by the fiscal operations of the Treasury or by the regulation of the monetary system"" ; ""Any claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war""; ""Any claim arising in a foreign country""; ""Any claim arising from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority""; ""Any claim arising from the activities of the Panama Canal Company""; or ""Any claim arising from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or a bank for cooperatives."" Some of these exceptions are more doctrinally significant than others.
Relatedly, exposing the United States to liability for discretionary acts could cause government officials to ""spend an inordinate amount of their tax-payer compensated time responding to lawsuits"" rather than serving the ""greater good of the community."" The discretionary function exception thus ""marks the boundary between Congress' willingness to impose tort liability upon the United States and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.""  As explained in greater detail in the following subsections, to determine whether the discretionary function exception bars a particular plaintiff's suit under the FTCA, courts examine whether the federal employee was engaged in conduct that was (1) discretionary and (2) policy-driven.
Whether the Challenged Conduct Is Discretionary When first evaluating whether ""the conduct that is alleged to have caused the harm"" to the plaintiff ""can fairly be described as discretionary,"" a court must assess ""whether the conduct at issue involves 'an element of judgment or choice' by the employee."" ""The conduct of federal employees is generally held to be discretionary unless 'a federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.'"" If ""the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive"" established by a federal statute, regulation, or policy, ""then there is no discretion in the conduct for the discretionary function exception to protect."" Put another way, the discretionary function exception does not insulate the United States from liability when its employees ""act in violation of a statute or policy that specifically directs them to act otherwise.""  Even where a federal statute, regulation, or policy pertaining to the challenged action exists, however, the action may nonetheless qualify as discretionary if the law in question ""predominately uses permissive rather than mandatory language."" In other words, where ""a government agent's performance of an obligation requires that agent to make judgment calls, the discretionary function exception"" may bar the plaintiff's claim under the FTCA.
The Supreme Court dismissed all three claims, holding ""that the Government is not liable under the [FTCA] for injuries to [military] servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to [military] service."" The Feres doctrine thus ""applies broadly"" to render the United States immune from tort liability resulting from virtually ""all injuries suffered by military personnel that are even remotely related to the individual's status as a member of the military."" For instance, courts have frequently barred active duty servicemembers from suing the United States for medical malpractice allegedly committed by military doctors."
42,"The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, ""without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.""  The 1934 Act is divided into titles and sections that describe various powers and concerns of the commission.
Targets and measures are published in the FCC's Performance Plan, and submitted with the commission's annual budget request to Congress.
FCC Operations: Budget, Authorization, and Reporting to Congress Since the 110 th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item.
His support of this regulatory philosophy can be seen in the language used in the strategic goals, such as ""reducing regulatory burdens"" and ensuring that ""regulations reflect the realities of the current marketplace, promote entrepreneurship, expand economic opportunity, and remove barriers to entry and investment.""  The use of this particular language may seem somewhat vague, but within the context of the net neutrality debate, discussed below, and the replacement of the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis with the Office of Economics and Analytics, those words take on more specific meaning, each intending to support the policy agenda of the Chairman.
The new Office of Economics and Analytics is ""responsible for expanding and deepening the use of economic analysis into FCC policy making, for enhancing the development and use of auctions, and for implementing consistent and effective agency-wide data practices and policies."" This new office reflects the goals in the current strategic plan:  We will modernize and streamline the FCC's operations and programs to … reduce regulatory burdens…."
43,"20-Year Funding Trends  Table 3 and Figure 1 provide the funding levels for enduring funds and Supplemental/OCO funds in the Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs for FY2001-2020 request (in current dollars).
In contrast to emergency supplemental appropriations, the Obama Administration included within the regular budget request in FY2012 what it described as short-term, temporary, war-related funding for the frontline states of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan—designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds, or OCO."
44,"For example, during the 111 th Congress P.L. 111-5 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the SBA an additional $730 million, including $375 million to temporarily subsidize the 7(a) and 504/Certified Development Companies (504/CDC) loan guaranty programs' fees ($299 million) and to temporarily increase the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90% ($76 million).
P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, provided $505 million (plus $5 million for administrative expenses) to extend the fee subsidies and 90% loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010; increased the 7(a) program's gross loan limit from $2 million to $5 million; and established an alternative size standard for the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan programs to enable more small businesses to qualify for assistance.
P.L. 111-322 , the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue the fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted (which occurred on January 3, 2011).
P.L. 115-189 , the Small Business 7(a) Lending Oversight Reform Act of 2018, among other provisions, codified the SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management; required that office to annually undertake and report the findings of a risk analysis of the 7(a) program's loan portfolio; created a lender oversight committee within the SBA; authorized the Director of the Office of Credit Risk Management to undertake informal and formal enforcement actions against 7(a) lenders under specified conditions; redefined the credit elsewhere requirement; and authorized the SBA Administrator to increase the amount of 7(a) loans not more than once during any fiscal year to not more than 115% of the 7(a) program's authorization limit.
The act clarified that 7(a) loans to ESOPs may be made under the Preferred Lenders Program; allows the seller to remain involved as an officer, director, or key employee when the ESOP or cooperative has acquired 100% ownership of the small business; and authorizes the SBA to finance transition costs to employee ownership and waive any mandatory equity injection by the ESOP or cooperative to help finance the change of ownership.
The SBA directs lenders to not decline a loan solely on the basis of inadequate collateral because ""one of the primary reasons lenders use the SBA-guaranteed program is for those Applicants that demonstrate repayment ability but lack adequate collateral to repay the loan in full in the event of a default."" Lender Eligibility Standards and Program Requirements Lender Eligibility Standards Lenders must have a continuing ability to evaluate, process, close, disburse, service, and liquidate small business loans; be open to the public for the making of such loans (and not be a financing subsidiary, engaged primarily in financing the operations of an affiliate); have continuing good character and reputation; and be supervised and examined by a state or federal regulatory authority, satisfactory to the SBA.
SBA form 1919 provides information about the borrower (name, name of business, social security number, date and place of birth, gender, race, veteran, etc.); the loan request; any indebtedness; the principals and affiliates; current or previous government financing; the applicant's eligibility (e.g., criminal information, citizenship status); the loan's eligibility for delegated or expedited processing (e.g., the borrower is not more than 60 days delinquent in child support payments, not proposed or presently excluded from participation in this transaction by any federal department or agency, has no potential for a conflict of interest due to an owner being a current or former SBA employee, a Member of Congress, or a SCORE volunteer); and, among other disclosures, the firm's existing number of employees, the number of jobs to be created as a result of the loan, and the number of jobs that will be retained as a result of the loan that would have otherwise been lost.
SBA form 1920 provides identifying information about the lender; the loan type (standard, SBAExpress, Export Express, etc.); loan terms; use of proceeds; the business's size and information about affiliates, if any; the applicant's character; if credit is reasonably available elsewhere; the type of business; potential conflicts of interest; and other information such the number of jobs created or retained.
P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 P.L. 111-240 provided $505 million (plus $5 million for administrative expenses) to extend the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage and 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs' fee subsidies through December 31, 2010 (later extended to March 4, 2011), or until available funding was exhausted (which occurred on January 3, 2011).
In addition to increasing the 7(a) program's authorization limit for FY2015, the act added requirements designed to ensure that SBA loans do not displace private sector loans (e.g., the SBA Administrator may not guarantee a 7(a) loan if the lender determines that the borrower is unable to obtain credit elsewhere solely because the liquidity of the lender depends upon the guarantied portion of the loan being sold on the secondary market, or if the sole purpose for requesting the guarantee is to allow the lender to exceed the lender's legal lending limit), and requires the SBA to report, on a quarterly basis, specified 7(a) program statistics to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and Small Business.
The SBA is required to provide at least 30 days' notice of its intent to exceed the 7(a) loan program's authorization limit to the House and Senate Committees on Small Business and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations' Subcommittees on Financial Services and General Government and may exercise this option only once per fiscal year.

The program is designed to increase the availability of credit to small businesses by permitting lenders to use their existing documentation and procedures in return for receiving a reduced SBA guaranty on loans.
In addition, P.L. 114-38 , the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, provided statutory authorization and made permanent the veteran's fee waiver in the SBAExpress program, except during any upcoming fiscal year for which the President's budget, submitted to Congress, includes a cost for the 7(a) program, in its entirety, that is above zero."
45,"Both FS and BLM timber sale planning and implementation proceed under similar principles of achieving multiple use and sustained yield.
The report describes general statutory authorities and regulations, planning activities, timber sales, and trends in the volume and value of timber harvested, first from FS lands, and then for BLM lands.
Planning, Sale Process, and Revenues Congress has directed FS to engage in long-term land use and resource management.
In the case of timber, plans describe where timber harvesting may occur and include measures of sustainable timber harvest levels, and are used to guide implementation of individual sales.
In general, harvest volume and value by region is a function of many complex factors, including the dominant timber type, age class, and condition; the suitability of FS sites for harvest operations; the legal limitations on land uses; and the status of the local forest products industry.

46,"As treatment of the individual elements makes clear, however, there seems little dispute that conviction requires the government to prove the use of either mail or wire communications in the foreseeable furtherance of a scheme and intent to defraud another of either property or honest services involving a material deception.
Scheme to Defraud The mail and wire fraud statutes ""both prohibit, in pertinent part, 'any scheme or artifice to defraud[,]' or to obtain money or property 'by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,"" or deprive another of the right to honest services by such means.
The bank fraud statute, for example, applies to ""whoever knowingly executes … a scheme or artifice — (1) to defraud a financial institution; or (2) to obtain any of the money, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by … a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses …"" It left the mail and wire fraud statutes, however, unchanged.
Yet materiality is an element of each offense, because at the time of the statutes' enactment, the word ""defraud"" was understood to ""require[] a misrepresentation or concealment of [a] material fact."" Thus, other than in an honest services context, a ""scheme to defraud"" for mail or wire fraud purposes must involve a material misrepresentation of some kind.
The victims entitled to restitution include those directly and proximately harmed by the defendant's crime of conviction, and ""in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity,"" like mail and wire fraud, ""any person directly harmed by the defendant's conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.""  Forfeiture Property that constitutes the proceeds of mail or wire fraud is subject to confiscation by the United States.
Merely depositing the proceeds of a money laundering predicate offense, like mail or wire fraud, does not alone constitute a violation of Section 1956.
There is no explicit authority for confiscation of property tainted by the offense, but either a private individual or the government may bring a civil action for treble damages under the False Claims Act. Section 287 offenses are neither RICO nor money laundering predicate offenses.
To establish the bank- property scheme to defraud offense, ""the Government must prove: (1) the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution; (2) the defendant did so with the intent to defraud a financial institution; and (3) the financial institution was federally insured."" As for the bank-custody offense, ""the government must prove (1) that a scheme existed to obtain moneys, funds, or credit in the custody of a federally-insured bank by fraud; (2) that the defendant participated in the scheme by means of material false pretenses, representations, or promises; and (3) that the defendant acted knowingly."" Violation of either offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 years and a fine of not more than $1 million.
The elements of defrauding offense ""are (1) fraudulent intent, (2) a scheme or artifice to defraud, and (3) a nexus with a security."" To prove a violation of Section 1348(2), the government must establish that the defendant (1) executed, or attempted to execute, a scheme or artifice; (2) with fraudulent intent; (3) in order to obtain money or property; (4) by material false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises."
47,"The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas and entities—that occur within assessment areas (where institutions have local deposit-taking operations).
The CRA requires federal banking regulatory agencies to evaluate the extent to which regulated institutions are effectively meeting the credit needs within their designated assessment areas, including LMI neighborhoods, in a manner consistent with the federal prudential regulations for safety and soundness .
It begins with a description of bank CRA examinations, including how a bank delineates its assessment area; the activities that may qualify for points under the three tests (i.e., lending, investment, and service) that collectively make up the CRA examination; and how the composite CRA rating is calculated.
The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, when banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities—that occur within assessment areas.
Qualifying CRA activities include mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit LMI areas and entities.
For example, banks may receive CRA credits for such activities as  investing in special purpose community development entities (CDEs), which facilitate capital investments in LMI communities (discussed below); providing support (e.g., consulting, detailing an employee, processing transactions for free or at a discounted rate, and providing office facilities) to minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions (MWLIs), thereby enhancing their ability to serve LMI customers; serving as a joint lender for a loan originated by MWLIs; facilitating financial literacy education to LMI communities, including any support of efforts of MWLIs and CDEs to provide financial literacy education; opening or maintaining bank branches and other transactions facilities in LMI communities and designated disaster areas; providing low-cost education loans to low-income borrowers; and offering international remittance services in LMI communities.
The CRA Examination Tests Regulators apply up to three tests, which are known as the lending , investment , and service tests, respectively, to determine whether a bank is meeting local credit need in designated assessment areas.
Although banks may receive CRA consideration under the investment test for purchasing state and local municipal bonds that fund public and community development projects in their designated assessment areas, banks may choose this investment for reasons unrelated to CRA.
Furthermore, banks receive CRA investment consideration when purchasing state and local municipal bonds that fund public and community development projects in their designated assessment areas.
Hence, banks may view EQ2s as a potentially profitable opportunity to invest in other specialized financial institutions and receive CRA consideration, particularly when the funds are subsequently used by CDFIs to originate loans in the banks' assessment areas."
48,"The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV)2 According to the Army The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the proposed United States Army program for replacement of the M-113 Family of Vehicles (FOV) to mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability by mission role variant within the Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) [now known as the Armored Brigade Combat Team – ABCT].
Other Program Issues DOD Inspector General (IG) Concerns29 An April 28, 2017, DOD IG report noted the Army has effectively managed the AMPV program, in particular keeping it within cost requirements and scheduled timeframes, but also expressed the following concerns: The program might not meet entry requirements for initial production and testing (Milestone C) because the Army has not fully resolved vehicle performance and design demonstration concerns.
Potential Revised AMPV Procurement Rate  As previously noted, on March 13, 2019, Army leadership reportedly announced the Army had decided to cut funding over the next five years for 93 programs—including the AMPV—to increase available funding for its new modernization strategy."
49,"It may be argued, however, that the granting of emergency powers by Congress is implicit in its Article I, Section 8, authority to ""provide for the common Defense and general Welfare;"" the commerce clause; its war, armed forces, and militia powers; and the ""necessary and proper"" clause empowering it to make such laws as are required to fulfill the executions of ""the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof."" There is a tradition of constitutional interpretation that has resulted in so-called implied powers, which may be invoked in order to respond to an emergency situation.
In 1973, a Senate special committee studying emergency powers published a compilation identifying some 470 provisions of federal law delegating to the executive extraordinary authority in time of national emergency.
The Emergency Concept Relying upon constitutional authority or congressional delegations made at various times over the past 230 years, the President of the United States may exercise certain powers in the event that the continued existence of the nation is threatened by crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstances.
During the Wilson and Roosevelt presidencies, a major procedural development occurred in the exercise of emergency powers—use of a proclamation to declare a national emergency and thereby activate all standby statutory provisions delegating authority to the President during a national emergency.
There was some annoyance that the President was retaining extraordinary powers intended only for a time of genuine emergency and a feeling that the Chief Executive was thwarting the legislative intent of Congress by continuously failing to terminate the declared national emergency.
A title of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 granting the President or Congress power to declare a civil defense emergency in the event of an attack on the United States occurred or was anticipated expired in June 1974 after the House Committee on Rules failed to report a measure continuing the statute."

51,"In some past Congresses, the House Financial Services Committee had adopted a committee rule that prohibited its Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology Subcommittee from holding a hearing on commemorative medal legislation—including Congressional Gold Medals—""unless the legislation is cosponsored by at least two-thirds of the members of the House."" Informal practices regarding cosponosrship requirements, however, may still exist.
Other Statutory Limitations Although Congress has approved legislation stipulating requirements for numerous other awards and decorations, there are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals.
For example, legislation authorizing the 65 th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers, Congressional Gold Medal stated the following: Status of Medals Gold medal legislation generally contains a statement that these awards are considered as national medals for the purpose of the U.S. Mint's statutory requirements for producing medals.
Currently, the House Financial Services Committee has not adopted any specific rules concerning committee consideration of Congressional Gold Medal legislation, although it has required a minimum number of cosponsors in past Congresses for committee consideration."
52,"The United States has not used conscription to fill manpower requirements for over four decades; however, the Selective Service System and the requirement for young men to register for the draft remain today.
This report is intended to provide Congress with information about how the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA), the Selective Service System (SSS), and associated requirements for registration have evolved over time.
It explains why the United States developed the SSS, what the system looks like today, how constituents are affected by the MSSA requirements, and what the options and considerations may be for the future of the Selective Service.
If the federal government were to reinstate the draft, draftees would likely be required to fill all authorized positions to include casualty replacements, billets in understrength units, and new military units activated to expand the wartime force.
Calder of New York said, ""under a volunteer system, there is no way of preventing men from leaving industries and crippling resources that are just as important as the army itself.""  In contrast to the Civil War draft, the Selective Service Act of 1917 did not allow for the furnishing of substitutes or bounties for enlistment.
It also provided for decentralized administration through local and district draft boards that were responsible for registering and classifying men, and calling registrants into service.
The Selective Training and Service Act and World War II In 1940, Europe was already at war, and despite the neutrality of the United States at the time, some in Congress argued that the United States could not continue with a peacetime force while other nations were mobilizing on a massive scale.
The act was the first instance of peacetime conscription in the United States and required men between aged 21 through 35 to register with local draft boards.
Criminal penalties for failing to comply with registration or other duties under this act included ""imprisonment of not more than five years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment."" The act also gave the President the authority to establish a Selective Service System, and to appoint a Director of the Selective Service with oversight of local civilian boards.
Concerned about lagging recruiting efforts and the rising power of the Soviet Union, Congress authorized reinstatement of the draft in the Selective Service Act of 1948, which was signed into law by President Truman on June 24, 1948.
President Carter signed Proclamation 4771 on July 2, 1980, reestablishing the requirement for all 18- to 25-year-old males to register for the Selective Service and setting out guidelines for registration.
Supporters of reestablishing the registration requirement for men argued that it would send a message to the Soviet Union that the United States was prepared to act to defend its interests and also that it would cut down the mobilization time in the event of a national emergency.
In 1985, Congress added a provision to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1986 that made an individual ineligible for federal civil service appointments if he ""is not registered and knowingly and willfully did not so register before the requirement terminated or became inapplicable to the individual."" Congress also expressed support for the peacetime registration program as a ""contribution to national security by reducing the time required for full defense mobilization,"" and as sending ""an important signal to our allies and to our potential adversaries of the United States defense commitment."" On November 6, 1986, President Reagan signed into law the Immigration Reform and Control Act. This law required males between the ages of 18 and 26 who are applying for legalization under the act to register for the Selective Service if they have not already done so.
Section 552 of the FY2017 NDAA also required DOD to prepare a preliminary report on the purpose and utility of the SSS to support the commission's work, to include (1) A detailed analysis of the current benefits derived, both directly and indirectly, from the Military Selective Service System, including— (A) the extent to which mandatory registration benefits military recruiting; (B) the extent to which a national registration capability serves as a deterrent to potential enemies of the United States; and (C) the extent to which expanding registration to include women would impact these benefits.
With respect to the SSS, the commission is considering options that could expand the registration requirement to include women; identify individuals who possess critical skills the nation might need; call for volunteers during times of emergency using the existing system; and, incorporate reasonable changes to identify, evaluate, and protect those who object to military service, but are otherwise willing to serve.
If the SSS were activated with the authority to induct individuals, the agency would be responsible for (1) holding a national draft lottery, (2) contacting registrants who are selected via the lottery, (3) arranging transportation for selectees to Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) for testing and evaluation of fitness to serve, and (4) activating a classification structure that would include area offices, local offices, and appeal boards.
Changing Registration Requirements to Include Women Women in the United States have never been required to register for the draft; however, recent DOD policy changes that have opened all military occupational specialties (MOSs) including ground combat positions to women have called into question the Selective Service exemption for women."
53,"On December 13, 2018, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 1091 (116 th Congress) by a vote of 394-1, stating ""the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military and security forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against humanity and genocide"" and calling on the Secretary of State to ""determine, based on available evidence, whether the actions by the Burmese military in northern Rakhine State in 2017 constitute crimes against humanity, genocide, or other crimes under international law."" Various organizations—including the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission in Myanmar (UNFFM), multiple human rights organizations, and the press—have conducted investigations into allegations that Burmese security forces committed serious human rights violations in Burma's seven ethnic states since the Tatmadaw transferred power to a mixed civilian/military government in 2011.
The UNFFM report recommends that the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) refer the human rights abuse allegations to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigation and possible prosecution.
On February 15, 2019, Min Aung Hlaing told Asahi Shimbun that ""there is no certain proof that the national army was involved in the persecution"" of Rohingya."" He also said that such accusations ""hurts the nation's dignity."" Besides the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Burmese military or security officers responsible for human rights violations in Burma (see Table 1 ).
Many of the reports and various human rights organizations have proposed various accountability mechanisms, including referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC), the creation of an ad hoc international criminal tribunal, the imposition of U.N. sanctions, and the enactment of bilateral restrictions on relations with the Burmese government and/or the Burmese military.
The United States currently has some restrictions on relations with Burma, and the Trump Administration has announced some additional restrictions in response to the alleged human rights abuses in Rakhine State, including the imposition of visa and economic restrictions on five Burmese military officers and two military units under the authority of the Global Magnitsky Act (see above)."
54,"Four agencies (referred to in this report as the federal land management agencies, or FLMAs) administer a total of 608 million acres (~95%) of these federal lands: the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all in the Department of the Interior (DOI).
For lands retained in federal ownership, discussion has focused on whether to curtail or expand certain land designations (e.g., national monuments proclaimed by the President or wilderness areas designated by Congress) and whether current management procedures should be changed (e.g., to allow a greater role for state and local governments or to expand economic considerations in decisionmaking).
CRS Report R44267, State Management of Federal Lands: Frequently Asked Questions , by Carol Hardy Vincent.
Agencies Managing Federal Lands The four FLMAs and BOEM manage most federal lands (onshore and offshore, surface and subsurface) Forest Service (FS) , in the Department of Agriculture, manages the 193 million acre National Forest System under a multiple-use mission, including livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, recreation, timber production, watershed protection, and wildlife and fish habitat.
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) , in the Department of the Interior (DOI), manages 246 million acres of public lands, also under a multiple-use mission of livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, recreation, timber production, watershed protection, and wildlife and fish habitat.
For example, the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 grants FWS authority to acquire land for the National Wildlife Refuge System—using funds from sources that include the sale of hunting and conservation stamps—after state consultation and agreement.

Congress frequently considers species management issues, such as balancing land and resources use, providing access to hunting and fishing on federal lands, and implementing endangered species protections."
55,"Overview On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted to Congress its FY2019 budget request, which included $41.86 billion of base (or enduring) funds for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS).
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), signed into law on February 15, included a total of $54.377 billion for SFOPS accounts, a 0.3% decrease over the FY2018 funding level and about 30% more than the Administration's request.
On February 14 Congress passed, and the President later signed into law, a full year appropriation ( P.L. 116-6 , Division F) that included $54.38 billion in total SFOPS funding, a 0.3% decrease from the FY2018 funding level and about 30% more than the Administration's request.
Similar to the House and Senate committee bills, the FY2019 enacted appropriation ( P.L. 116-6 ) maintained funding for the State Department and Related Agency category slightly above FY2018 funding level.
In most cases, P.L. 116-6 , in a manner similar to the House and Senate committee bills, maintained annual budget authority for these accounts closer to the FY2018 funding levels than the Administration requested (see following sections for more detailed analysis).
According to the State Department, planned CSD activities, for which $20 million was requested, included ""coordinating U.S. government efforts in specific sub-regions; enhancing the capacity of local actors to build resilience against disinformation, including thwarting attacks on their IT systems; providing attribution of adversarial disinformation; and convening anti-disinformation practitioners, journalists, and other influencers to exchange best practices, build networks, and generate support for U.S. efforts against disinformation."" The House committee report registered concern regarding ""foreign propaganda and disinformation that threatens United States national security, especially as carried out by China, Russia, and extremists groups"" and asserted that the GEC ""is expected to use a wide range of technologies and techniques to counter these campaigns,"" consistent with its statutory mandate.
The State Department's request included $869.54 million to provide its share of what it maintains is the $2.20 billion in annual funding that the Benghazi Accountability Review Board (ARB) recommended for the Capital Security Cost Sharing (CSCS) and Maintenance Cost Sharing (MCS) programs (the remainder of the funding is provided through consular fee revenues and contributions from other agencies).
The House committee report maintained that funds the House bill made available for ESCM would allow for the State Department's CSCS and MCS contributions, when combined with those from other agencies and consular fees, to exceed the ARB's annual recommended funding and support "" the accelerated multi-year program to construct new secure replacement facilities for the most vulnerable embassies and consulates."" The Senate committee bill stipulated that of funds made available for ESCM by it and prior acts making appropriations for SFOPS, not less than $1.02 billion shall be made available for the department's FY2019 CSCS and MCS contributions; the joint explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 116-6 indicated that Congress provided the same amount for this purpose for FY2019.
The enacted legislation, like the House and Senate committee bills, provided a share of CIPA funds as two-year funds, as requested by the department.
Together with food aid accounts in the Agriculture appropriation, total enacted foreign aid within the international affairs budget was $39.85 billion, or 0.7% below the FY2018 actual funding level and 39% above the FY2019 request."
56,"LNG as an engine, or ""bunker,"" fuel potentially could help the United States reduce harmful air emissions, it could create a new market for domestic natural gas, and it could create economic opportunities in domestic shipbuilding.
This report discusses impending International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards limiting the maximum sulfur content in shipping fuels, the market conditions in which LNG may compete to become a common bunker fuel for vessel operators, and the current status of LNG bunkering globally and in the United States.
Its standards limiting sulfur emissions from ships, adopted in 2008, have led vessel operators to consider alternatives to petroleum-based fuels to power their ships.
Ship owners have two main options for meeting the emission requirements with existing engines: burn low-sulfur conventional fuel (or biofuels) or install scrubbers to clean their exhaust gases.
Although switching to low-sulfur fuels would increase fuel costs compared to conventional, high-sulfur fuels, it would require little or no upfront capital cost and would allow ocean carriers to use existing infrastructure to bunker ships at ports.
Shipping of LNG from the United States to Asia or Europe adds from $1 to $2/MMBtu, so, based on the 2018 average cost in Figure 1 , LNG delivered to a port overseas would cost on the order of $7 to $8/MMbtu under long-term contracts, depending upon timing and location.
Added costs associated with marketing, storing and transporting LNG in bunkering operations (discussed below) would likely require ports to charge a rate for LNG bunker fuel above spot market prices.
However, constructing small-scale liquefaction facilities to produce and deliver LNG on site requires considerable planning and significant capital investment, in one case on the order of $70 million for a mid-sized port.
For example, a container port of significant size typically has multiple terminals, so even with an on-site liquefaction facility, it may need additional infrastructure or supply vessels for moving LNG to other port locations where a cargo ship might be berthed.
Port Fourchon, LA In 2015, Harvey Gulf International Marine (Harvey) began LNG bunkering operations in the Gulf of Mexico to fuel its small fleet of LNG-powered offshore supply vessels serving offshore oil rigs.
Although existing LNG import or export terminals in North America could supply LNG for regional bunkering operations, such activities would require additional investment for infrastructure such as LNG transfer facilities and bunker barges.
Domestic Considerations The IMO sulfur standards apply to ship owners globally, as does the development of new LNG supply and bunkering infrastructure.
More specifically, could international adoption of LNG as a bunker fuel create an important new market for U.S. natural gas producers, shipbuilders, or infrastructure developers?"
57,"Treasury cash flow projections are therefore subject to uncertainty, which complicates attempts to estimate how long extraordinary measures would enable the federal government to meet its financial obligations.
The 2011 Debt Ceiling Episode Begins On May 16, 2011, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced that the federal debt had reached its statutory limit and declared a debt issuance suspension period, which would allow certain extraordinary measures to extend Treasury's borrowing capacity until about August 2, 2011.
The Treasury Secretary, in a letter to Congress dated May 2, 2011, had indicated that he would declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, unless Congress acted beforehand, which would allow certain extraordinary measures to extend Treasury's borrowing capacity until early August 2011.
In particular, the BCA included major provisions that imposed discretionary spending caps, enforced by automatic spending reductions, referred to as a ""sequester""; established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, whose recommendations would be eligible for expedited consideration; required a vote on a joint resolution on a proposed constitutional amendment to mandate a balanced federal budget; and instituted a mechanism allowing for the President and Treasury Secretary to raise the debt ceiling, subject to congressional disapproval.
The Debt Limit in 2013 Debt Limit Reached at End of December 2012 On December 26, 2012, the U.S. Treasury stated that the debt would reach its limit on December 31 and that the Treasury Secretary would declare a debt issuance suspension period to authorize extraordinary measures (noted above, described below) that could be used to meet federal payments for approximately two months.
CBO had previously estimated that federal debt would reach its limit near the end of December 2012, and that the extraordinary measures could be used to fund government activities until mid-February or early March 2013.
Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew notified Congress on May 20, 2013, that he had declared a new debt issuance suspension period (DISP), triggering authorities that allow the Treasury Secretary to use extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until August 2.
In early October 2013, the U.S. Treasury issued a brief that outlined how various measures of economic confidence, asset prices, and market volatility responded to the debt limit episode in the summer of 2011, and the prospect that the federal government might not have been able to pay its obligations in a timely fashion.
Resolution of the Debt Limit Issue in October 2013 On September 25, Treasury Secretary Lew notified Congress that the government would exhaust its borrowing capacity around October 17 according to updated estimates.
While the Treasury could again employ extraordinary measures after the suspension ended after February 7, 2014, its ability to continue meeting federal obligations would be limited by large outflows of cash resulting from individual income tax refunds.
In December 2013, the U.S. Treasury had notified congressional leaders that according to its estimates, extraordinary measures would extend its borrowing authority ""only until late February or early March 2014."" On January 22, 2014, Secretary Lew called for an increase in the debt limit before the end of debt limit suspension on February 7, 2014, or the end of February.
Once the most recent debt limit suspension lapsed, Treasury Secretary Lew declared a Debt Issuance Suspension Period (DISP) on March 16, 2015, which empowered him to use extraordinary measures to meet federal fiscal obligations until July 30, 2015.
Secretary Lew indicated in a separate letter, sent the previous day, that those extraordinary measures would enable the U.S. Treasury to meet federal financial obligations ""for at least a brief additional period of time"" after the end of October."
58,"The act specifies that the SBA's mission is to promote the interests of small businesses to enhance competition in the private marketplace: It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.
The SBA currently administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion.
Four additional programs are provided recommended funding in appropriations acts under ED programs, but are discussed in other sections of this report because of the nature of their assistance: (1) the SBA's Growth Accelerators Initiative ($2 million in FY2019) is a capital investment program and is discussed in the capital access programs section; (2) the SBA's 7(j) Technical Assistance Program ($2.8 million in FY2019) provides contacting assistance and is discussed in the contracting programs section; (3) the National Women's Business Council ($1.5 million in FY2019) is a bipartisan federal advisory council and is discussed in the executive direction programs section; and (4) the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP, $18 million in FY2019) provides grants to states to support export programs that assist small business concerns.
PRIME provides SBA grants to nonprofit microenterprise development organizations or programs that have ""a demonstrated record of delivering microenterprise services to disadvantaged entrepreneurs; an intermediary; a microenterprise development organization or program that is accountable to a local community, working in conjunction with a state or local government or Indian tribe; or an Indian tribe acting on its own, if the Indian tribe can certify that no private organization or program referred to in this paragraph exists within its jurisdiction."" The SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development (OVBD) administers several management and training programs to assist veteran-owned businesses, including 22 Veterans Business Outreach Centers which provide ""entrepreneurial development services such as business training, counseling and resource partner referrals to transitioning service members, veterans, National Guard & Reserve members and military spouses interested in starting or growing a small business."" The SBA's Office of Native American Affairs provides management and technical educational assistance to Native Americans (American Indians, Alaska natives, native Hawaiians, and the indigenous people of Guam and American Samoa) to start and expand small businesses.
The Emerging Leaders initiative is a seven‐month executive leader education series consisting of ""more than 100 hours of specialized training, technical support, access to a professional network, and other resources to strengthen their businesses and promote economic development."" At the conclusion of the training, ""participants produce a three‐year strategic growth action plan with benchmarks and performance targets that help them access the necessary support and resources to move forward for the next stage of business growth."" The Learning Center is the SBA's primary online training service, which offers free online courses on business planning, marketing, government contracting, accounting, and social media, providing learners an ""opportunity to access entrepreneurship education resources through toolkits, fact sheets, infographic tip sheets, instructor guides, and audio content."" Capital Access Programs Overview The SBA has authority to make direct loans but, with the exception of disaster loans and loans to Microloan program intermediaries, has not exercised that authority since 1998.
For example, businesses participating in the SBA's 7(a) loan guaranty program are deemed small if they either meet the SBA's industry-specific size standards for firms in 1,047 industrial classifications in 18 subindustry activities described in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) or do not have more than $15 million in tangible net worth and not more than $5 million in average net income after federal taxes (excluding any carryover losses) for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application.
In an effort to assist small business owners, in FY2019, the SBA is waiving the annual service fee for 7(a) loans of $150,000 or less made to small businesses located in a rural area or a HUBZone and reducing the up-front one-time guaranty fee for these loans from 2.0% to 0.6667% of the guaranteed portion of the loan in FY2019; and pursuant to P.L. 114-38 , the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, the up-front, one-time guaranty fee on all veteran loans under the 7(a) SBAExpress program (up to and including $350,000).
The program is designed to increase the availability of credit to small businesses by permitting lenders to use their existing documentation and procedures in return for receiving a reduced SBA guarantee on loans.
This program assists service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses through set-asides and sole-source awards.
In 1988, Congress authorized the President to annually establish government-wide minimum participation goals for procurement contracts awarded to small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
Each federal agency was also directed to ""have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency."" The SBA was required to report to the President annually on the attainment of these goals and to include this information in an annual report to Congress.
The Inspector General Act provides the OIG with the following responsibilities: ""promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the management of SBA programs and supporting operations; conduct and supervise audits, investigations, and reviews relating to the SBA's programs and support operations; detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse; review existing and proposed legislation and regulations and make appropriate recommendations; maintain effective working relationships with other Federal, State and local governmental agencies, and nongovernmental entities, regarding the mandated duties of the Inspector General; keep the SBA Administrator and Congress informed of serious problems and recommend corrective actions and implementation measures; comply with the audit standards of the Comptroller General; avoid duplication of Government Accountability Office (GAO) activities; and report violations of Federal criminal law to the Attorney General."" Capital Investment Programs The SBA has several programs to improve small business access to capital markets, including the Small Business Investment Company program, the New Market Venture Capital Program (now inactive), two special high technology contracting programs (the Small Business Innovative Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs), and the growth accelerators initiative.
The act also provided the SBA an additional $697.5 million; including $510 million to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses.
The SBA is required to provide at least 30 days' notice of its intent to exceed the 7(a) loan program's authorization limit to the House and Senate Committees on Small Business and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations' Subcommittees on Financial Services and General Government and may exercise this option only once per fiscal year."
59,"Major disaster declarations also authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grant assistance to state, local, and tribal governments, residences, and certain private nonprofit (PNP) facilities that provide critical services.
Most businesses will need to apply for a Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan if they want assistance from the federal government for uninsured loss resulting from a disaster.
If Congress were to replace SBA business disaster loans with a grant program, it might consider providing grants for similar types of loss.
Alternatively, Congress might implement a small business disaster grant program and continue to provide loan assistance through the SBA.
To support this argument, they would point out that Section 101(b) of the Stafford Act states that it ""is the intent of the Congress, by this Act, to provide an orderly and continuing means of assistance by the federal government to state and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage which result from such disasters...."" They may therefore conclude that if the federal government were to provide disaster grants to businesses, those grants should be provided under the Small Business Act or some other authorization statute.
Elements of the arguments for and against small business disaster grants outlined above will be explored in greater detail in "" Policy Considerations and Options for Congress ."" Historical Developments Some question why the federal government provides grant assistance to individuals and households, state, local, and tribal governments, and nonprofit organizations, among others, but not to businesses.
The Disaster Relief Act established a permanent authority that committed the federal government to provide specific types of assistance to states and localities (but not businesses) following a major disaster declaration.
Some of the considerations Congress may contemplate for a potential small business disaster grant program include: (1) preventing the duplication of administrative functions and benefits; (2) the selection of the authorization statute; (3) whether (and what type of) declarations and designations will put the disaster grant program into effect; (4) what size businesses should be eligible for disaster grant assistance; and (5) the types of activities eligible for grant assistance.
If Congress authorizes a small business disaster grant program, it may consider conducting investigations and holding hearings to help determine which authorization statute would be best at reducing duplication of administrative functions and benefits.
The Stafford Act authorizes the President to issue major disaster declarations that provide states, tribes, and localities with a range of federal assistance in response to natural and human-caused incidents.
If Congress authorized a small business disaster grant program under the Stafford Act, it could consider using the existing declaration and IA designation framework used to trigger eligibility for the SBA Disaster Loan Program.
If SBA physical disaster declarations were to be applied to a small business disaster grant program, the grants could be made available to small businesses for incidents that do not meet the damage threshold of a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. 2.
This type of declaration could arguably make more incidents eligible for grant assistance because the 512 incidents in Figure 2 and Table 1 were presumably issued for incidents that did not meet the per capita threshold for a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. It should be noted, however, that the number of grants made available under an SBA Administrator physical disaster declaration would likely depend on whether the grants would only provide assistance for repairing and rebuilding damaged structure or if they would also provide assistance for economic loss.
If Congress were to authorize a small business disaster grant program, it may also consider whether the grants should be available for economic loss or limit them to specific types of damage.
For example, providing grants for this purpose could be more expensive than mitigation loans, but cost less than a small business disaster grant program designed to assist businesses following a disaster."
60,"For example The 2002 farm bill (the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, P.L. 107-171 ) was enacted under a budget surplus that allowed it to make changes that were projected to increase spending by $73 billion, or 22%, over a 10-year budget window—more than half of which was for the farm commodity programs.
The 2008 farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246 ) was officially budget neutral, though it included $10 billion of offsets over 10 years from tax-related and other provisions that allowed it to increase spending on the Nutrition, Conservation, and Disaster titles.
Importance of Baseline to the Farm Bill The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline is a projection at a particular point in time of future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law.
The House-passed bill would have made 10-year reductions in outlays in the Conservation, Nutrition, Energy, and Crop Insurance titles that the conference agreement did not adopt.
Nonetheless, the section-by-section scores of the Senate-passed bill showed both increases and decreases in the Conservation, Nutrition, Commodities and Miscellaneous titles ( Figure 9 )."
61,"The U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service issues its annual Combined Statement that reports budget data for all federal agencies at an account level as well as detailed summaries of receipts, including user fees.
OMB guidelines on user fees outline aims similar to the benefit principle, mandating that federal agencies  ensure that each service, sale, or use of Government goods or resources provided by an agency to specific recipients be self-sustaining; promote efficient allocation of the Nation's resources by establishing charges for special benefits provided to the recipient that are at least as great as costs to the Government of providing the special benefits; and allow the private sector to compete with the Government without disadvantage in supplying comparable services, resources, or goods where appropriate.
Logic of Pigou Taxation May Apply to Design of User Fees and Charges The benefit principle is in some ways similar to the concept of Pigou taxation—that taxing goods linked to negative spillovers, such as pollution, can enhance economic efficiency by diminishing those spillovers.
Issues and Options for Congress Congressional Oversight and Control of the Federal Purse Congress could constrain agency discretion by requiring more user fee proceeds be either subject to annual appropriations or deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund, although that may limit agencies' capacity to respond to new public demands and other changing conditions, as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted .
Broader Policies Regarding User Fees and Charges Congress can promote economic efficiency and an equitable sharing of public burdens by choosing appropriate means of financing federal operations."
62,"Administration's Recent Budget Requests The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request proposed eliminating McGovern-Dole and FFP Title II and moving funding for international food aid to the IDA account within the SFOPS appropriations bill.
Congressional Appropriations Both the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Acts provided funding for U.S. international food aid programs in the Foreign Assistance and Related Programs (Title V) and General Provisions (Title VII) titles.
FY2018 enacted funding of $1.716 billion for FFP Title II includes $1.6 billion provided in the Foreign Assistance title and $116 million provided in the General Provisions title of the Agriculture Appropriations Act. The funding Congress provides in the Foreign Assistance title is a base amount that is often compared across fiscal years to determine whether program funding has increased or decreased.
Appropriations for FY2019 The FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Act (Division B of P.L. 116-6 ) provides $1.942 billion in total funding for international food aid programs, a 1% increase from the FY2018 enacted amount of $1.924 billion."
63,"Specific topics of interest may include ongoing issues such as interest in reforming the nation's housing finance system, how to prioritize appropriations for federal housing programs in a limited funding environment, oversight of the implementation of changes to certain housing programs that were enacted in prior Congresses, and the possibility of extending certain temporary housing-related tax provisions.
In general, rising home prices, relatively low interest rates, and rising rental costs have been prominent features of housing and mortgage markets in recent years.
Although interest rates have remained low, rising house prices and rental costs that in many cases have outpaced income growth have led to increased concerns about housing affordability for both prospective homebuyers and renters.
Therefore, rising incomes and, especially, interest rates that are still low by historical standards contribute to monthly mortgage payments being considered affordable under these measures despite recent house price increases.
In the years since the housing market turmoil of the late 2000s, the number and share of renter households has increased, leading to lower rental vacancy rates and higher rents in many markets.
Share of Renters The housing and mortgage market turmoil of the late 2000s led to a substantial decrease in the homeownership rate and a corresponding increase in the share of households who rent their homes.
These include the potential for legislative housing finance reform, new leadership at FHFA and the potential for administrative changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and certain issues that could affect Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's finances and mortgage standards, respectively.
In addition to addressing the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, housing finance reform legislation could potentially involve changes to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or other federal programs that support the mortgage market.
Proposals differ on structural questions as well as on specific implementation issues, such as whether, and how, certain affordable housing requirements that currently apply to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be included in a new system.
In recent years, for example, FHFA has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in risk-sharing transactions, develop a common securitization platform for issuing mortgage-backed securities, and undertake certain pilot programs.
Additionally, the budget references policy changes designed to reduce the cost of federal rental assistance programs, including the Making Affordable Housing Work Act of 2018 (MAHWA) legislative proposal, released by HUD in April 2018."
64,"Indeed, the Supreme Court in 1943 described the First Amendment's protection against compelled speech as a ""fixed star in our constitutional constellation."" Accordingly, government actions mandating speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny by courts, and will be upheld ""only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests."" However, the Court has also long accepted a variety of laws that require commercial actors to make certain disclosures to consumers, confirming that Congress can compel certain disclosures, even those involving protected speech, without running afoul of the First Amendment.
The Court first explained that commercial speech enjoys ""lesser protection"" than ""other constitutionally guaranteed expression."" After emphasizing that First Amendment protection for commercial speech ""is based on the informational function of advertising,"" the Court said that ""there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity."" Accordingly, the Court held that the government may prohibit ""forms of communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it"" as well as ""commercial speech related to illegal activity."" But if the regulated ""communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity,"" the government's action is subject to intermediate scrutiny.
Instead, the Court noted that the state's provision only involved ""commercial advertising, and its prescription has taken the form of a requirement that appellant include in his advertising purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which his services will be available."" In this commercial context, the Court said that the attorney's ""constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal,"" noting that in previous cases it had stated that states might ""appropriately require[]"" warnings or disclaimers ""in order to dissipate the possibility of consumer confusion or deception."" Rather than applying heightened scrutiny, the Court held that under these circumstances, ""an advertiser's rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers."" The Zauderer Court did warn, however, that commercial disclosure requirements raise First Amendment concerns, observing that ""unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements might offend the First Amendment by chilling protected commercial speech."" But the Court rejected the contention that the disclosure requirement before it was unduly burdensome.
As described by the Court and discussed above, the state regulation upheld in Zauderer required ""purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which [attorneys'] services [would] be available,"" and the provision was ""reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers."" Subsequent cases in both the Supreme Court and the lower courts have tested the extent to which this reasonableness review applies outside of the specific factual circumstances presented in Zauderer .
The Court also expressed concern that the unlicensed notice ""target[ed]"" certain speakers in imposing those burdens by focusing on ""facilities that primarily provide 'pregnancy-related' services."" Defining a Zauderer Disclosure While the Supreme Court has emphasized that Zauderer 's reasonableness review is available only for certain types of compelled commercial disclosures, lower courts have disagreed on the precise circumstances required to apply Zauderer .
In rejecting a litigant's argument that the Supreme Court's decision in United Foods limited Zauderer only to laws intended to prevent consumer deception, the Second Circuit said that United Foods ""simply distinguishes Zauderer on the basis that the compelled speech in Zauderer was necessary to prevent deception of consumers; it does not provide that all other disclosure requirements are subject to heightened scrutiny."" Zauderer Review  If a commercial disclosure requirement involves only ""purely factual and uncontroversial information"" about the goods or services being sold, and is therefore eligible for review under Zauderer , then it will be constitutional so long as the disclosure requirement is ""reasonably related"" to the government's interest.
would understand them to be judicial endorsements."" The court, however, said that even assuming ""that excerpts of judicial opinions are potentially misleading to some persons,"" the state had failed ""to explain how [an attorney's] providing a complete judicial opinion somehow dispels this assumed threat of deception."" The court reasoned that ""providing a full judicial opinion does not reveal to a potential client that an excerpt of the same opinion is not an endorsement."" Additionally, the court held that the disputed requirement was ""unduly burdensome,"" as it ""effectively rules out the possibility that [an attorney] can advertise with even an accurately quoted excerpt of a judicial statement about his abilities."" And in the view of the Third Circuit, ""that type of restriction—an outright ban on advertising with judicial excerpts—would properly be analyzed under the heightened Central Hudson standard of scrutiny."" As Dwyer suggests, courts may strike down disclosure requirements under Zauderer if the requirement is ""unduly burdensome."" In NIFLA , the Supreme Court held that the unlicensed notice was likely unconstitutional because it ""unduly burden[ed] protected speech,"" noting that it applied to all advertisements for these licensed facilities, regardless of their content.
The Court suggested that the provision requiring licensed facilities to disseminate notices about state-provided services might be subject to strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation of speech, but concluded that it did not need to resolve that question because the notice could not ""survive even intermediate scrutiny.""  Significantly, however, the NIFLA Court never described the licensed notice as involving commercial speech."
65,"U.S. officials have recognized the contributions that PMF volunteers have made to Iraq's fight against the Islamic State; they also remain wary of the potential for Iran-linked elements of the PMF to evolve into permanent proxy forces, whether they remain tied to the Iraqi state or work outside formal Iraqi government and military control.
U.S. policy seeks to support the long-term development of Iraq's military, counterterrorism, and police services as alternatives to the continued use of PMF units to secure Iraq's borders, communities, and territory recaptured from the Islamic State.
PMF units remain active throughout the territories in dispute between the Iraqi national government and the federally recognized Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq, with local populations in some areas opposed to the PMF presence.
In January 2019, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that the PMC/PMF ""plan to use newfound political power gained through positions in the new government to reduce or remove the U.S. military presence while competing with the Iraqi security forces for state resources.""  In general, the popularity of the PMF and broadly expressed popular respect for the sacrifices made by individual volunteers in the fight against the Islamic State create complicated political questions for Iraqi leaders.
That said, U.S. military officials report that ""competition over areas to operate and influence between the PMF and the ISF will likely result in violence, abuse, and tension in areas where both entities operate.""  The Kurdistan Region and Relations with Baghdad The Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq (KRI) enjoys considerable administrative autonomy under the terms of Iraq's 2005 federal constitution, but issues concerning territory, security, energy, and revenue sharing continue to strain ties between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the national government in Baghdad.
In March 2019, KDP and PUK leaders announced a four-year political agreement that reportedly includes joint commitments on the formation of the new KRG government and candidates for the Iraqi national Minister of Justice position and governorship of Kirkuk.
U.S. Policy and Issues in the 116th Congress Security Cooperation and U.S. Training Iraqi military and counterterrorism operations against remnants of the Islamic State group are ongoing, and the United States military and its coalition partners continue to provide support to those efforts at the request of the Iraqi government.
UNDP officials report that earmarking of funding by donors ""can result in funding being directed away from areas highlighted by the Iraqi authorities as being in great need."" In January 2019, UNDP identified $426 million in stabilization program funding shortfalls in five priority areas ""deemed to be the most at risk to future conflict"" and ""integral for the broader stabilization of Iraq.""  Trump Administration requests to Congress for FY2018-FY2020 monies for Iraq programs included proposals to fund continued U.S. contributions to post-IS stabilization.
These parallel (and sometimes competing) goals may raise several policy questions for U.S. officials and Members of Congress, including  the makeup and viability of the Iraqi government; Iraqi leaders' approaches to Iran-backed groups and the future of militia forces mobilized to fight the Islamic State; Iraq's compliance with U.S. sanctions on Iran; the future extent and roles of the U.S. military presence in Iraq; the terms and conditions associated with U.S. security assistance to Iraqi forces; U.S. relations with Iraqi constituent groups such as the Kurds; and potential responses to U.S. efforts to contain or confront Iran-aligned entities in Iraq or elsewhere in the region.
The 115 th Congress considered proposals directing the Administration to impose U.S. sanctions on some Iran-aligned Iraqi groups, and enacted legislation containing reporting requirements focused on Iranian support to nonstate actors in Iraq and other countries."
66,"The federal government directly funds research and development (R&D) activities to achieve national goals or support national priorities, such as funding basic life science research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or developing new weapons systems in the Department of Defense (DOD).
Additional sections address issues related to the emergence of disruptive technologies; the America COMPETES Act; oversight of federally supported academic research; technology transfer; the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education; and innovation-related tax policy.
Federal R&D funding seeks to address a broad range of national interests, including national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security; advance knowledge generally; develop the scientific and engineering workforce; and strengthen U.S. innovation and competitiveness.
Concerns by some about reductions in federal R&D funding have been exacerbated by increases in the R&D investments of other nations (China, in particular); globalization of R&D and manufacturing activities; and trade deficits in advanced technology products, an area in which the United States previously ran trade surpluses (most recently in 2001).

In 2003, Congress enacted the 21 st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act ( P.L. 108-153 ), providing a legislative foundation for some of the activities of the NNI, establishing programs, assigning agency responsibilities, and setting authorization levels through FY2008."
67,"Morales initially supported the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which Guatemala asked the United Nations (U.N.) to form in 2007 to help the government combat corruption, human rights violations, and other crimes.
Many observers are concerned that Morales's efforts could undermine ongoing investigations by the Guatemalan attorney general's office and judicial proceedings, make political reform more difficult, and heighten instability in Guatemala.
In August and September 2017, Guatemala's attorney general and CICIG announced they were seeking to lift the president's immunity from prosecution as they investigated alleged violations of campaign finance laws and bonuses paid to him by the military.
Nonetheless, tensions have heightened as President Morales's efforts to impede CICIG have escalated, and the Guatemalan Congress has tried to reduce criminal penalties for corruption and human rights violations.
In January 2019, thousands of Guatemalans joined renewed public protests supporting CICIG and calling for the resignations of President Morales and members of Congress seen as protecting corrupt practices.
In February 2018, the Morales administration dismissed the three senior officials of the national police, saying it sought ""to generate more positive results to benefit citizen security and the fight against organized crime."" A wide range of people, including human rights activists and business leaders, expressed concern at their dismissal.
The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala congratulated Ramos just a few weeks before his dismissal for his team's work in reducing homicides by 10% compared to January 2017 and for the PNC's ""fight against corruption and to improve security throughout Guatemala."" In response to the high level of violence over many years, a number of municipalities asked for military troops to augment their ineffective police forces; the Guatemalan government has been using a constitutional clause to have the army ""temporarily"" support the police in combating crime.
Then-Attorney General Aldana worked closely with the commissioner of CICIG to prosecute high-level corruption and human rights violation cases.
Before the new government was sworn in, then-Attorney General Aldana requested legal action against retired army colonel Edgar Ovalle, a key advisor to Morales and a legislator-elect with the FCN-Nación, for alleged civil war-era (1960-1996) human rights violations.
Efforts to Combat Impunity and Corruption In what many observers see as a step forward in Guatemala's democratic development, the Public Ministry's corruption and human rights abuse investigations in recent years have led to the arrest and trial of high-level government, judicial, and military officials.
Since 2007, CICIG has worked with the Public Ministry and the attorney general's office to reduce the country's rampant criminal impunity by strengthening Guatemala's capacity to investigate and prosecute crime.
The United States, other governments, and international institutions have expressed broad support for the work of both the attorney general's office and CICIG over the years, and offered praise for their accomplishments.
A 2018 U.S. State Department report highlights these accomplishments:  CICIG's hundreds of investigations have resulted in charges against more than 200 current and former government officials—including two recent presidents and several ministers, police chiefs, military officers, and judges.
(See "" U.S.-Guatemalan Relations "" below.) Despite some differences of opinion over CICIG's efforts, many in Congress are concerned that Morales's efforts to hinder or oust CICIG could undermine objectives of the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, by undermining efforts to strengthen the rule of law and heightening instability in Guatemala.
The G13 group of donors to Central America, including the United States, issued a statement saying that providing amnesty ""would contravene Guatemala's international obligations; would harm reconciliation efforts; and could seriously erode faith in the rule of law in Guatemala."" The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered Guatemala to cease discussion of the amnesty bill and to permanently shelve it.
According to the State Department, current U.S. policy objectives in Guatemala include addressing the underlying drivers of illegal migration; supporting the institutionalization of democracy; encouraging respect for human rights and rule of law, and the efficient functioning of CICIG; supporting broad-based economic growth and sustainable development and maintaining mutually beneficial trade and commercial relations, including ensuring that benefits of CAFTA-DR reach all sectors of Guatemalan society; cooperating to fight money laundering, corruption, narcotics trafficking, alien smuggling, trafficking in persons, and other transnational crimes; supporting Central American integration through support for resolution of border and territorial disputes; reinforcing the government's economic development and political reform plan in the Alliance for Prosperity to be self-reliant in addressing drivers of migration and illicit trafficking of goods and people; and improving Guatemala's business climate.
In February, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly met with President Morales and Commissioner Velásquez in Guatemala, and reiterated U.S. support for the Public Ministry's and CICIG's fight against corruption.
Congress conditioned another 50% of aid until the governments addressed another 12 concerns, including combating corruption; countering gangs and organized crime; increasing government revenues; supporting programs to reduce poverty and promote equitable growth; and protecting the rights of journalists, political opposition parties, and human rights defenders to operate without interference."
68,"Board of Education , President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights had already sketched out the basic pattern for Title VI, calling for ""establishment by act of Congress or executive order"" of a federal office to review ""the expenditures of all government funds,"" so that none would go to subsidize discrimination based on race, color, creed, or national origin.
Banning Intentional Discrimination (Disparate Treatment) Despite Title VI's basic ambiguity, the courts have long agreed that, at a minimum, Section 601 bars federally funded programs from intentionally singling out individuals for adverse treatment because of their race.
Disparate Treatment: Circumstantial Evidence Although still litigated, over the years such facially discriminatory policies and decisions have grown less common—a shift widely attributed to laws like the 1964 Civil Rights Act. As a result, the more usual case today instead involves allegations of racially motivated mistreatment under a policy or decision that, at least on its face, is race-neutral.
Immediately after saying that they were ""rely[ing] solely on [Section] 601"" in siding with the student plaintiffs, the majority in Lau turned to recite a regulation issued by HEW, specifically addressing what recipient school districts had to do under Title VI to ensure students with ""linguistic deficiencies"" had the same ""opportunity to obtain the education generally obtained by other students in the system."" That discussion drew a contrasting concurrence from three other Justices, all of whom agreed that the student should prevail under a disparate impact theory, but believed that the proper basis for that theory—and the result in favor of the students—was HEW's regulation implementing Title VI, not Section 601 itself.
Section 602, as noted, directs agencies to promulgate regulations ""to effectuate"" the antidiscrimination prohibition of Section 601 ""consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute."" And pursuant to that directive, all Cabinet-level federal funding agencies, along with many smaller agencies, have since issued rules and guidance under Title VI outlawing disparate impact discrimination.
Civil Service Commission , the Court had at one time indicated—in a decision dating to ""the dawn of [the last] century""—that ""an administrative regulation's conformity to statutory authority was to be measured by the same standard as a statute's conformity to constitutional authority."" And as it happened, only a few years before Guardians , the Court had read the Fifteenth Amendment, despite ""only prohibit[ing] purposeful racial discrimination in voting,"" to allow ""Congress [to] implement that prohibition by banning voting practices that are discriminatory in effect."" Congress could do that, according to Justice Stevens, because the Fifteenth Amendment—much like Title VI—supplements its prohibition against racially discriminatory voting policies with a provision empowering Congress ""to enforce"" that prohibition ""by appropriate legislation."" Given the structural similarity between the amendment and Title VI, Justice Stevens saw no reason why Section 602 should give federal agencies any less authority than the Fifteenth Amendment offers Congress—including authority to outlaw policies with discriminatory effects.
But the agency could not substantively amplify that prohibition by adding to the types of discrimination outlawed by Section 601—as a disparate impact rule arguably would, given the Court's view in Sandoval that Section 601 does not bar a policy simply for having discriminatory effects.
As the agency primarily responsible for enforcing Title VI in the public schools, as well as nearly all colleges and universities, OCR handles every year a large volume and variety of claims alleging race and national origin discrimination.
Congress, on the other hand, could expressly endorse disparate impact under Title VI by, for example, grafting that standard onto Section 601, as it has done in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That addition would unambiguously allow funding agencies to investigate policies and practices under Title VI based on their discriminatory effects, regardless of the underlying intent."
69,"Five months after taking power, Amir Sabah suspended the Assembly in May 2006 to prevent oppositionists from questioning the Prime Minister over the government's refusal to reduce the number of electoral districts to 5 (from 25).
In March 2011, a Shia parliamentarian's request to ""grill"" the Foreign Minister about Kuwait's sending of naval forces to support Bahrain's Sunni minority government against a Shia-led uprising prompted a cabinet resignation and reshuffling.
On December 6, 2011, Amir Sabah dissolved the National Assembly and set new elections for February 2, 2012 (within the mandated 60 days).
Citing ""circumstances in the region"" (an apparent reference to the Islamic State challenge and conflicts in Syria and Yemen), the Amir suspended the National Assembly and set new elections for November 26, 2016—earlier than planned.
The State Department called the elections ""generally free and fair."" Recent Developments Reflecting its altered balance of factions, the Assembly ""grilled"" the Prime Minister in 2017 for ""administrative regularities."" To forestall further Assembly challenges, the Amir dissolved the cabinet in October 2017.
Broader Human Rights Issues2 On broad human rights issues, the State Department identifies the principal human rights problems in Kuwait as allegations of torture of detainees; political prisoners; restrictions on freedom of speech, including criminalization of criticism of government officials and defamation of religion; limited rights for a stateless population referred to as Bidoon s ; trafficking in persons; criminalization of male same-sex sexual activity; and reports of forced labor, especially among foreign workers.
U.S. democracy programs in Kuwait funds discussions with Kuwaiti leaders, public diplomacy, training civil society activists, enhancing the capabilities of independent Kuwaiti media, promoting women's rights, and providing a broad spectrum of educational opportunities.
The National Endowment for Democracy, which obtains funds from the State Department, has in recent years given grants to Kuwaiti groups that promote civil society, human rights, women's rights, and the rights of noncitizens in Kuwait.
U.S.-Kuwait Relations and Defense Cooperation  Kuwait was not strategically or politically close to the United States until the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), when Kuwait—a backer of Iraq—sought U.S. help against Iranian attacks.
Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA), Strategic Dialogue, and Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) Status Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and the U.S. role in ending the Iraqi occupation, deepened the U.S.-Kuwait defense relationship.
A formal bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) was signed on September 19, 1991, seven months after the U.S.-led expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait in the 1991 Operation Desert Storm.
During a December 3-5, 2017, visit to Kuwait, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis said that the U.S.-Kuwait military relationship is ""very close."" The Amir has met with President Trump on three occasions, most recently September 5, 2018, focusing on regional issues including the U.S. concept of an anti-Iran Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA).
According to Defense Department budget documents, Kuwait contributed about $210 million per year in similar in-kind support to help defray the costs incurred by the U.S. military personnel that rotated through Kuwait into or out of Iraq during 2003-2011.
During a visit to Iraq by Kuwait's Prime Minister on June 12, 2013, the two countries agreed to take the issues of still-missing Kuwaitis and Kuwaiti property out of the Chapter 7 supervision of the United Nations and replace them with alternative mechanisms, as discussed below.
The June 16, 2013, visit of the Kuwaiti Prime Minister to Iraq—which followed progress on border demarcations issues—resulted in an Iraq-Kuwait joint recommendation to remove these issues of missing property and persons from the Chapter 7 U.N. mandate.
No GCC state deployed ground forces to Syria or Iraq, and Kuwaiti officials say the government does not fund or arm any rebel groups fighting in Syria.
In July 2016, Kuwait said its security forces thwarted three planned Islamic State terrorist attacks in Kuwait, including a plot to blow up a Shia mosque."
70,"The report also provided statistics quantifying the scale of the conflict, which has taken a huge toll on Colombian society: more than 23,000 selective assassinations between 1981 and 2012; internal displacement of more than 5 million Colombians due to land seizure and violence; 27,000 kidnappings between 1970 and 2010; and 11,000 deaths or amputees from anti-personnel land mines laid primarily by Colombia's main insurgent guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
However, former paramilitaries joined armed groups (called criminal bands, or Bacrim, by the Colombian government) who continued to participate in the lucrative drug trade and commit other crimes and human rights abuses.
The AUC demobilization, combined with the stepped-up counternarcotics efforts of the Uribe administration and increased military victories against the FARC's irregular forces, helped to bring down violence, although a high level of human rights violations still plagued the country.
During his first two years in office, President Santos reorganized the executive branch and built on the market opening strategies of the Uribe administration and secured a free-trade agreement with the United States, Colombia's largest trade partner, which went into effect in May 2012.
While continuing the security strategy, the Santos administration began to re-orient the Colombian government's stance toward the internal armed conflict through a series of reforms.
The countries of Norway, Cuba, Venezuela, and Chile each held an international support role, with Norway and Cuba serving as peace talk hosts and ""guarantors."" Following the formal start in Norway, the actual negotiations began a month later in mid-November 2012 in Cuba, where the FARC-government talks continued until their conclusion in August 2016.
His crowning achievement, the accord negotiated over 50 rounds of talks, covered five substantive topics: rural development and agricultural reform; political participation by the FARC; an end to the conflict, including demobilization, disarmament and reintegration; a solution to illegal drug trafficking; and justice for victims.
Colombia's Constitutional Court determined in October 2017 that over the next three presidential terms (until 2030), Colombia must follow the peace accord commitments negotiated by the Santos administration and approved by the Colombian Congress in 2016.
The ELN, with diminished resources and reduced offensive capability, according to government estimates, declined to fewer than 2,000 fighters, although some analysts maintain in 2018 the forces grew as high as 3,400, including former FARC who were recruited to join the ELN as the larger rebel group demobilized.
According to the State Department's 2018 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , Venezuela's porous western border with Colombia, current economic crisis, weak judicial system, sporadic international drug control cooperation, and a permissive and corrupt environment make it a preferred trafficking route for illicit drugs.
Although it is widely recognized that Colombia's efforts to reduce violence, combat drug trafficking and terrorism, and strengthen the economy have met with success, many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights groups continue to report significant human rights violations, including violence targeting noncombatants, that involves killings, torture, kidnappings, disappearances, forced displacements, forced recruitments, massacres, and sexual attacks.
The Center for Historical Memory report issued to the Colombian government in July 2013 traces those responsible for human rights violations to the guerrillas (the FARC and ELN), the AUC paramilitaries and successor paramilitary groups, and the Colombian security forces.
For instance, 13 social leaders were assassinated in the southwest department of Cauca in the first six months of the year, a department in Colombia with the fourth largest area devoted to coca cultivation in the country and host to several peace accord programs associated with rural development, including voluntary eradication of drug crops.
Nevertheless, the Venezuelan and Colombian governments committed to jointly combat narcotics trafficking and illegal armed group activities along the porous Venezuelan-Colombian border and Venezuela remained a supporting government of the FARC-government peace talks (along with Chile, Norway, and Cuba) through 2016, even after former President Chávez died in office in March 2013.
In September 2017, President Trump announced that he had considered designating Colombia in noncompliance with U.S. counternarcotics requirements, but noted that he had not proceeded with the step in part because of Colombian training efforts to assist others in the region with combating narcotics and related crime.
Focused initially on counternarcotics, and later counterterrorism, a program called Plan Colombia laid the foundation for a strategic partnership that has broadened to include sustainable development, human rights, trade, regional security, and many other areas of cooperation.
U.S. support to Plan Colombia consisted of training and equipping counternarcotics battalions in the Colombian Army and specialized units of the Colombian National Police, drug eradication programs, alternative development, and other supply reduction programs.
The Bush Administration requested new flexibility so that U.S.-provided assistance would back a ""unified campaign against narcotics trafficking, terrorist activities, and other threats to [Colombia's] national security"" due to the breakdown of peace talks between the FARC and the Pastrana government in February 2002.
In 2007, the Uribe administration announced a shift to a ""Policy of Consolidation of Democratic Security."" The new doctrine was based on a ""whole-of-government"" approach to consolidate state presence in marginal areas that were historically neglected—vulnerable to drug crop cultivation, violence, and control by illegal armed groups.
The United States supported the Colombian government's consolidation strategy through an inter-agency program called the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI).
In the FY2017 legislation, Congress appropriated the following:  The ESF account increased to $187 million (from $134 million in FY2016) to build government presence, encourage crop substitution to replace drug crops, and provide other assistance to conflict victims, including Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities.
Additional tools for monitoring human rights compliance by Colombian security forces receiving U.S. assistance are the so-called ""Leahy Law"" restrictions, which Congress first passed in the late 1990s prior to the outset of Plan Colombia.
Because of the large amount of security assistance provided to Colombian forces (including the military and police), the State Department reportedly vets more candidates for assistance in Colombia than in any other country.
Other Colombians maintain that support for peace programs in Colombia is important not only to benefit former FARC or other demobilized combatants but also to fulfill promises the government made in the peace accords to the country's 8.6 million victims of the five-decade conflict.
The annual level of foreign assistance provided by the U.S. Congress for Colombia began to decline in FY2008 and then gradually increased in FY2017 and FY2018 to support peace and implementation of the FARC-government peace accord."
71,"Effective rates, by contrast, whether marginal or average, measure how STRs are affected by tax provisions that modify someone's taxable income or tax liability.
It also delayed the indexation of the two new tax brackets for one year and permanently extended the limitation on itemized deductions and the accelerated phaseout of the personal exemption from OBRA90.
Several other provisions of the act modified the tax brackets and limitations on personal exemptions and deductions for higher-income taxpayers.
Although TRA86 established only two statutory individual marginal income tax rates, it included a 5% surcharge on the taxable income of certain upper-income households.
OBRA90 eliminated the tax rate bubble created by TRA86, and replaced it with a limitation on itemized deductions and a new approach to phasing out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upper-income households.
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 OBRA93 made several changes in the individual marginal income tax rate structure.
Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003  JGTRRA accelerated several changes to the individual income tax rate structure that were first enacted under EGTRRA.
A simplified hypothetical example illustrates the impact that a lack of indexation can have over time for the tax burdens (as measured by the average income tax rate) of individual taxpayers.
With an inflation adjustment equal to the rise in the CPI-U, the value of the standard deduction for a joint return would have increased from $5,000 in 1988 to $10,252 in 2017, and the personal exemption for each family member would have increased from $1,950 to $3,998."

73,"In January 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) designated government programs designed to protect critical technologies, including the U.S. export control system, as a ""high-risk"" area warranting a ""strategic reexamination of existing programs to identify needed changes."" GAO's report named poor coordination among export control agencies, disagreements over commodity jurisdiction between the Departments of State and Commerce, unnecessary delays and inefficiencies in the license application process, and a lack of systematic evaluative mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of export controls.
Former Secretary Gates proposed a four-pronged approach that would establish a single export control licensing agency for both dual-use, munitions and exports licensed to embargoed destinations; a unified control list; a single enforcement coordination agency; and a single integrated information technology system, which would include a single database of sanctioned and denied parties.

The ECA requires the Secretary of Commerce to ""establish and maintain a list"" of controlled items and ""foreign persons and end-uses that are determined to be a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States""; require export licenses; ""prohibit unauthorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers of controlled items""; and ""monitor shipments and other means of transfer."" Administration The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce administers the export licensing and enforcement functions of the dual-use export control system.
These regulations also impose foreign policy controls on encryption items and on hot section technology, which is ""for the development, production, or overhaul of commercial aircraft engines, components, and systems."" The EAR include ""enhanced controls"" on hot section technology and require a license ""for exports and reexports to all destinations, except Canada."" The U.S. government reviews license applications for such technology ""on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the proposed export or reexport is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests."" Foreign policy-based controls are also based on adherence to multilateral nonproliferation control regimes, such as the Nuclear Suppliers' Group, the Australia Group (chemical and biological precursors), and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
Administration Exports of defense goods and services are administered by DDTC, which is a component of the Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and consists of four offices: Management, Policy, Licensing, and Compliance.
Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA) A Department of Defense (DOD) Field Activity under the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, DTSA coordinates the technical and national security review of direct commercial sales export licenses and commodity jurisdiction requests received from the Departments of Commerce and State.
In a February 2011 speech, then-BIS Assistant Secretary Kevin Wolf elucidated seven principles driving the Administration's export control reform efforts Controls should focus on a small core set of key items that can pose a serious national security or intelligence threat to the United States and its interests; Controls should be fully coordinated with the multilateral export control regimes in order to be effective; Unilateral controls must address an existing legal or foreign policy objective; Control lists must clearly identify which items are controlled and be easily updated as technology emerges, matures, or becomes widely available; Licensing processes must be predictable and timely; Enforcement capabilities must be enhanced to address noncompliance and increase capacity to interdict unapproved transfers; and Controls must address counterterrorism policy and the need to export items that support homeland security priorities.
The Four Singularities A Single Licensing Agency In his speech introducing the Administration's reform efforts, then-Secretary Gates described the bureaucratic structure of the U.S. export control system as a ""byzantine amalgam of authorities, roles, and missions scattered around different parts of the federal government."" As noted above, licensing is divided among the Department of Commerce for dual-use and certain military items, the Department of State for munitions, the Department of the Treasury for certain sanctions, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy for certain nuclear materials and technologies.
If they are not reclassified, the items ""are designated as EAR99 items unless either the CCL is amended to impose a control on such items under another ECCN or the ECCN 0Y521 classification is extended."" BIS may extend this classification ""for two one-year periods, provided that the U.S. Government has submitted a proposal to the relevant multilateral regime(s) to obtain multilateral controls over the item."" BIS may further extend the classification ""only if the Under Secretary for Industry and Security makes a determination that such extension is in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States."" According to the Obama Administration, the USML would contain ""only those items that provide at least a significant military or intelligence applicability that warrant the controls the AECA requires."" The reconstituted Munitions List may then be aligned with the CCL by adopting its A-E commodity organization structure and adding two additional categories: F and G for ITAR specific controls."
74,"Next, the report discusses the interaction of federal and state minimum wages over time, and finally, the Appendix provides detailed information on the major components of minimum wage policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
The Appendix provides detailed information on state minimum wage policy in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including the legislation authorizing the state minimum wage and the relevant legislative language regarding the rate and mechanism of adjustment.
Below are the two main approaches to regulating the adjustment of state minimum wage rates in states with rates above the federal minimum: legislatively scheduled increases and indexing to inflation.
Following the three-step increase in the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to the current $7.25 (2007-2009), 15 states, comprising 33% of the civilian labor force, had rates above the federal minimum wage in 2010."
75,"Representatives use offset amendments for a variety of reasons, including to (1) ensure that proposals increasing funding for certain activities in any appropriations measure do not violate parliamentary rules enforcing certain spending ceilings; (2) comply with the prohibition against increasing total spending in a general appropriations bill; (3) garner support for efforts to reduce funding for certain activities by transferring those funds to popular programs; and (4) provide a focal point for discussion of a particular issue.
Parliamentary Context Offset amendments are needed to ensure amendments increasing funding for certain activities in a regular appropriations bill, supplemental appropriations bill, or continuing resolution do not also cause spending ceilings associated with the annual budget resolution to be exceeded.
The second rule, the 311(a) point of order, prohibits, in part, floor consideration of any committee-reported appropriations measure and related amendments providing new budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year that would cause the applicable total budget authority and outlay ceilings in the budget resolution for that fiscal year to be exceeded.
Because regular appropriations bills and supplementals generally include several lump-sum and line-item appropriations, adding a new appropriation or increasing funding for an appropriation in the bill typically requires an offset.
The clause 2(f) offset amendment transfers appropriations among objects in the pending bill and, taken as a whole, does not cause the bill to exceed the total new budget authority or outlay levels already provided in the bill.
These amendments (1) must offset any increase in both budget authority and outlays, (2) can only include language transferring appropriations, (3) may contain certain unauthorized appropriations, and (4) are exempt from a ""demand for a division of the question."" Must Offset Both Budget Authority and Outlays Under clause 2(f) of House Rule XXI, any spending increases in a clause 2(f) offset amendment must be offset by commensurate reductions in both new budget authority and outlays.
Reachback amendments must offset budget authority, but not necessarily outlays; may add new lump-sum appropriations and set-asides, subject to certain restrictions; may not include unauthorized appropriations; must be drafted to avoid a demand for a division of the question; and may provide across-the-board spending reductions as offsets."
76,"Specifically, Congress funds and oversees Reclamation's management of Colorado River Basin facilities, including facility operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species.
In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate drought and stretch basin water supplies and has considered new authorities for Reclamation to combat drought and enter into agreements with states and Colorado River contractors.
The act ratified the 1922 compact, authorized the construction of a federal facility to impound water in the Lower Basin (Boulder Dam, later renamed Hoover Dam) and related facilities to deliver water in Southern California (e.g., the All-American Canal, which delivers Colorado River water to California's Imperial Valley), and apportioned the Lower Basin's 7.5 MAF per year among the three Lower Basin states.
It also directed the Secretary of the Interior to serve as the sole contracting authority for Colorado River water use in the Lower Basin and authorized several storage projects for study in the Upper Basin.
Congress's approval of the compact in the BCPA was conditioned on a number of factors, including ratification by California and five other states (thereby allowing the compact to become effective without Arizona's concurrence), and California agreeing by act of its legislature to limit its water use to 4.4 MAF per year and not more than half of any surplus waters.
It also directed that the Secretary of the Interior propose operational criteria for Colorado River Storage Project units (including the releases of water from Lake Powell) that prioritize (1) Treaty Obligations to Mexico, (2) the Colorado River Compact requirement for the Upper Basin to deliver 75 MAF to Lower Basin states over any 10-year period, and (3) carryover storage to meet these needs.
Also important for Lower Basin Operations are Davis Dam/Lake Mohave, which regulates flows to Mexico under the 1944 Treaty, and Parker Dam/Lake Havasu, which impounds water for diversion into the Colorado River Aqueduct (thereby allowing for deliveries to urban areas in southern California) and CAP (allowing for diversion to users in Arizona).
To achieve compliance under ESA, federal entities involved in managing water supplies in the Lower Colorado River met with resource agencies from Arizona, California, and Nevada; Native American Tribes; environmental groups; and recreation interests to develop a program to conserve species along a portion of the Colorado River.
Development of the agreement began in 2005, when, in response to drought in the Southwest and the decline in basin water storage (and a record low point in Lake Powell of 33% active capacity), the Secretary of the Interior instructed Reclamation to develop coordinated strategies for Colorado River reservoir operations during drought or shortages.
Upper Basin Drought Contingency Plan The Upper Basin DCP aims to protect against Lake Powell reaching critically low elevations; it also authorizes storage of conserved water in the Upper Basin that could help establish the foundation for a water use reduction effort (i.e., a ""Demand Management Program"") that may be developed in the future."
77,"It amends SDWA to promote compliance with SDWA requirements, reauthorize appropriations for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, expand program eligibilities, increase emphasis on assisting disadvantaged communities, make SDWA compliance more affordable, and improve consumer confidence in public water supplies.
Title II also authorizes new grant programs to reduce lead contamination in school drinking water, assist small and disadvantaged communities, and develop public water system resilience, among other purposes.
Title IV of AWIA also includes several amendments to the Clean Water Act to address stormwater by expanding a municipal sewer overflow grant programs to include stormwater management projects, reauthorizing appropriations for said municipal sewer overflow grant program, and directing EPA to establish a task force for stormwater management.
This SDWA reauthorization bill would have authorized activities and revised existing law to improve water systems' technical, managerial, financial capacity, and consumer confidence and facilitate communities' access to financial assistance for drinking water infrastructure improvements.
The act is implemented through programs that (1) establish national primary drinking water regulations and monitoring and reporting requirements for contaminants present in water delivered by public water systems, (2) promote water system compliance through technical and financial assistance and capacity development programs, and (3) address public water systems' preparedness for emergencies.
Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Program Authorized in 1996, the DWSRF program provides federal financial assistance to communities to finance drinking water infrastructure improvements.
These revisions expand the eligible uses of DWSRF financial assistance, provide states with additional flexibility to administer the DWSRF program, and include provisions intended to make DWSRF assistance more accessible to public water systems.
Section 2015(g) of AWIA requires EPA to gather specified information on DWSRF administration from state drinking water administrators and report to Congress on best practices for implementing the DWSRF to facilitate the application process and to improve DWSRF financial management and sustainability.
This section authorizes EPA to award grant funds to eligible public water systems for projects that increase resilience to natural hazards, including hydrologic changes.
Drinking Water Infrastructure for Indians Tribes (AWIA Section 2001) Section 2001 of AWIA authorizes a new grant program at EPA for public water systems that serve federally recognized Indian tribes.
Section 2013 authorized $25.0 million to be appropriated each year for FY2020 and FY2021 for EPA to make grants to public water systems to plan or implement projects to address their system's resiliency.
AWIA Section 2013 requires EPA to issue guidance and provide technical assistance on conducting assessments and preparing emergency response plans for public water systems serving fewer than 3,300 individuals.
Among other purposes, AWIA's DWSRF revisions authorize the use of DWSRF funds for (1) source water protection activities, (2) providing additional financing flexibility for public water systems, (3) replacing and repairing aging infrastructure, and (4) increasing subsidies for disadvantaged communities."
78,"Introduction Including the first woman to serve in 1917, a total of 365 women have been elected or appointed to serve in the U.S. Congress.
In an exception to these incremental changes, the elections in 1992, which came to be known popularly as the ""Year of the Woman,"" represented a jump in the number of women in Congress.
As Figure 4 shows, approximately 70% (39) of all women who have served in the Senate initially entered Senate service by winning an election (regular or special).

79,"The Chief Counsel and Advocacy support the development and growth of American small businesses by  ""intervening early in federal agencies' regulatory development processes on proposals that affect small entities and providing Regulatory Flexibility Act compliance training to federal agency policymakers and regulatory development officials; producing research to inform policymakers and other stakeholders on the impact of federal regulatory burdens on small businesses, to document the vital role of small businesses in the economy, and to explore and explain the wide variety of issues of concern to the small business community; and fostering a two-way communication between federal agencies and the small business community."" Advocacy has 55 staff members and received an appropriation of $9.120 million for FY2019.
The bill would have, among other provisions, revised and enhanced requirements for federal agency notification of the Chief Counsel prior to the publication of any proposed rule; expanded the required use of small business advocacy review panels from three federal agencies to all federal agencies, including independent regulatory agencies; empowered the Chief Counsel to issue rules governing federal agency compliance with the RFA; specifically authorized the Chief Counsel to file comments on any notice of proposed rulemaking, not just when the RFA is concerned; and transferred size standard determinations for purposes other than the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 from the SBA's Administrator to the Chief Counsel.
2847 , the Prove It Act of 2016, which was reported by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, would have authorized the Chief Counsel to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to review any federal agency certification that a proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, is not required to submit a regulatory flexibility analysis of the rule.
P.L. 94-305 also retained Advocacy's five duties as identified in P.L. 93-386 ; specified that one of Advocacy's primary functions was to examine the role of small business in the American economy and the problems faced by small businesses and to recommend specific measures to address those problems; empowered the Chief Counsel, after consultation with and subject to the approval of the SBA Administrator, to employ and fix the compensation of necessary staff, without going through the normal competitive procedures directed by federal law and the Office of Personnel Management; specified that the Chief Counsel could obtain expert advice and other services, and hold hearings; directed each federal department, agency, and instrumentality to furnish the Chief Counsel with reports and information deemed by the Chief Counsel as necessary to carry out his or her functions; ordered the Chief Counsel to provide Congress, the President, and the SBA with information concerning his or her activities; and authorized to be appropriated $1 million for Advocacy, with any appropriated funds remaining available until expended.
The RFA also requires federal agencies to publish a ""regulatory flexibility agenda"" each April and October in the Federal Registe r , listing regulations that the agency expects to propose or promulgate which are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; provide their regulatory flexibility agenda to the Chief Counsel and to small businesses or their representatives; retrospectively review rules that have or will have a significant impact within 10 years of their promulgation to determine whether they should be continued without change or should be amended or rescinded to minimize their impact on small entities; and ensure that small entities have an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process."
80,"This report is intended to help Congress understand how state and local election systems work and how their workings might relate to federal activity on election administration.
It starts by describing the distribution of election administration duties at the state and local levels and the structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections.
It then uses examples from past federal action on election administration to illustrate some of the ways the duties and structures of state and local election systems interact with federal activity.

Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the election system; relationship between local election officials and the state; and population size and density of the jurisdiction served by the system.
Changes to the duties and structures of state and local election systems have sometimes also been side effects of other federal activity on election administration.
Selected Effects of State and Local Duties and Structures on Federal Action This section provides examples of ways in which the distribution of election administration duties at the state and local levels and the structures of state and local election systems can affect the implementation of federal election administration law."
81,"According to the JCPOA, Iran was to ""complete"" a series of steps set out in an Iran-IAEA ""Roadmap for Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues."" According to IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano, this road map set out ""a process"" under a November 24, 2013, Joint Plan of Action between Iran and the P5+1, ""to enable the Agency, with the cooperation of Iran, to make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme."" According to a December 2, 2015, report from Amano to the IAEA Board of Governors, ""[a]ll the activities contained in the road-map were implemented in accordance with the agreed schedule."" The road map required Amano to present this report, which contains the agency's ""final assessment on the resolution"" of the aforementioned outstanding issues.
In response, the board adopted a resolution on December 15, 2015, that notes Iran's cooperation with the road map and ""further notes that this closes the Board's consideration"" of the ""outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear programme."" Since the IAEA has verified that Iran has taken the steps required for Implementation Day to take effect, the board is no longer focused on Iran's compliance with past Security Council resolutions and past issues concerning Iran's safeguards agreement.
This latter resolution requests the IAEA Director General ""to undertake the necessary verification and monitoring of Iran's nuclear-related commitments for the full duration of those commitments under the JCPOA."" The December 2015 IAEA resolution requests the Director General to issue quarterly reports to the board regarding Iran's ""implementation of its relevant commitments under the JCPOA for the full duration of those commitments."" The Director General is also to report to the Board of Governors and the Security Council ""at any time if the Director General has reasonable grounds to believe there is an issue of concern"" regarding Tehran's compliance with its JCPOA or safeguards obligations.
Several U.N. Security Council Resolutions required Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA's investigation of its nuclear activities, suspend its uranium enrichment program, suspend its construction of a heavy-water reactor and related projects, and ratify the Additional Protocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement.
According to the April 2018 State Department report  [t]he IAEA continues to exercise its full authorities in pursuing any new safeguards-relevant or JCPOA-related information in Iran, including any new concerns regarding weaponization should they arise, through implementation of Iran's Safeguards Agreement, Additional Protocol, and the enhanced transparency and verification measures contained in the JCPOA.
Nevertheless, a November 2009 report from ElBaradei described Tehran's failures both to notify the agency of the decision to begin constructing the Fordow facility, as well as to provide the relevant design information in a timely fashion, as ""inconsistent with"" Iran's safeguards obligations.
Article 45 of that agreement requires that Tehran notify the IAEA ""with design information in respect of a modification relevant for safeguards purposes sufficiently in advance for the safeguards procedures to be adjusted when necessary,"" according to Amano's report, which describes Iran's enrichment decision as ""clearly relevant for safeguards purposes."" The IAEA board has neither formally found that any of the Iranian actions described above are in noncompliance with Tehran's safeguards agreement, nor referred these issues to the U.N. Security Council.
The board is then to ""call upon the recipient State or States to remedy forthwith any non-compliance which it finds to have occurred,"" as well as ""report the non-compliance to all members and to the Security Council and General Assembly of the United Nations."" In the case of Iran, the September 24, 2005, IAEA board resolution (GOV/2005/77) stated that the board found that Iran's many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply with its NPT Safeguards Agreement, as detailed in GOV/2003/75 [a November 2003 report from then-Director General ElBaradei], constitute non compliance in the context of Article XII.C of the Agency's Statute; According to the resolution, the board also found that the history of concealment of Iran's nuclear activities referred to in the Director General's report [GOV/2003/75], the nature of these activities, issues brought to light in the course of the Agency's verification of declarations made by Iran since September 2002 and the resulting absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes have given rise to questions that are within the competence of the Security Council, as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security."

86,"Introduction Issues for Congress This report provides background information and issues for Congress on multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC), which are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs.
At least two things give the contractor confidence that DOD will not terminate an MYP contract and that the multiyear stream of business consequently will materialize: For a program to qualify for MYP, DOD must certify, among other things, that the minimum need for the items to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contract in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities.
In addition, 10 U.S.C. 2306b states the following: If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered into under this section is authorized by law for a particular procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain conditions established by law (including a condition as to cost savings to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that significant savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program.
In annual DOD appropriations acts, the provision permitting the use of MYP for one or more defense acquisition programs is typically included in the title containing general provisions, which typically is Title VIII.
A 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report stated the following: Although DOD had been entering into multiyear contracts on a limited basis prior to the 1980s, the Department of Defense Authorization Act, [for fiscal year] 1982, codified the authority for DOD to procure on a multiyear basis major weapon systems that meet certain criteria.
BBC can reduce the unit procurement costs of ships by amounts less than or perhaps comparable to those of MYP, if the authority granted for using BBC explicitly includes authority for making economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases of components.
The lack of such a statute gives DOD and Congress full flexibility in determining when and how to use BBC for programs that may not qualify for MYP, but for which a multiyear contract of some kind might produce substantial savings.
Multiyear contracts: acquisition of property (a) In General.-To the extent that funds are otherwise available for obligation, the head of an agency may enter into multiyear contracts for the purchase of property whenever the head of that agency finds each of the following: (1) That the use of such a contract will result in significant savings of the total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts.
(2) In submitting a request for a specific authorization by law to carry out a defense acquisition program using multiyear contract authority under this section, the Secretary of Defense shall include in the request the following: (A) A report containing preliminary findings of the agency head required in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a), together with the basis for such findings.
(7) The execution of multiyear contracting authority shall require the use of a present value analysis to determine lowest cost compared to an annual procurement."
87,"The federal pipeline safety program resides primarily within the Department of Transportation's (DOT's) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), although its inspection and enforcement activities rely heavily upon partnerships with the states.
Congress subsequently mandated the expansion of integrity management to natural gas pipelines, along with other significant changes to federal pipeline safety requirements, through a series of agency budget reauthorizations as discussed below.
It also mandated a review of the adequacy of federal pipeline safety regulations related to internal corrosion control, and required PHMSA to increase the transparency of enforcement actions by issuing monthly summaries, including violation and penalty information, and a mechanism for pipeline operators to make response information available to the public.
According to the MOU, PHMSA agrees to promptly alert FERC when safety activities may impact commission responsibilities, notify FERC of major accidents or significant enforcement actions involving pipelines under FERC's jurisdiction, refer to FERC complaints and inquiries by state and local governments and the public about environmental or certificate matters related to FERC-jurisdictional pipelines, and when requested by FERC, review draft mitigation conditions considered by the commission for potential conflicts with PHMSA's regulations.
Under the MOU, FERC agrees to promptly alert PHMSA when the commission learns of an existing or potential safety problem involving natural gas transmission facilities, notify PHMSA of future pipeline construction, periodically provide PHMSA with updates to the environmental compliance inspection schedule, and coordinate site inspections, upon request, with PHMSA officials, notify PHMSA when significant safety issues have been raised during the preparation of environmental assessments or environmental impact statements for pipeline projects, and refer to PHMSA complaints and inquiries made by state and local governments and the public involving safety matters related to FERC-jurisdictional pipelines.
In addition to specifics about the San Bruno incident, the hearing addressed more general pipeline issues, including public awareness initiatives, pipeline technology, and oversight of pipeline safety by federal and state regulators.
Because the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has not incorporated the use of effective and meaningful metrics as part of its guidance for performance-based management pipeline safety programs, its oversight of state public utility commissions regulating gas transmission and hazardous liquid pipelines could be improved.
In an opening statement about the San Bruno incident report, the NTSB chairman summarized the board's findings as ""troubling revelations … about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety."" The NTSB's final incident report concluded ""that PHMSA's enforcement program and its monitoring of state oversight programs have been weak and have resulted in the lack of effective Federal oversight and state oversight.""  The NTSB issued 39 recommendations stemming from its San Bruno incident investigation, including 20 recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation and PHMSA.
These recommendations included the following: conducting audits to assess the effectiveness of PHMSA's oversight of performance-based pipeline safety programs and state pipeline safety program certification, requiring pipeline operators to provide system-specific information to the emergency response agencies of the communities in which pipelines are located, requiring that automatic shutoff valves or remote control valves be installed in high consequence areas and in class 3 and 4 locations, requiring that all natural gas transmission pipelines constructed before 1970 be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test that incorporates a pressure spike test, requiring that all natural gas transmission pipelines be configured so as to accommodate internal inspection tools, with priority given to older pipelines, and revising PHMSA's integrity management protocol to incorporate meaningful metrics, set performance goals for pipeline operators, and require operators to regularly assess the effectiveness of their programs using meaningful metrics.
The NTSB issued eight recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation and PHMSA, including auditing the business practices of PHMSA's onshore pipeline facility response plan programs, including reviews of response plans and drill programs, to correct deficiencies, allocating sufficient resources to ensure that PHMSA's facility response plan program meets all of the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, clarifying and strengthening federal regulation related to the identification and repair of pipeline crack defects, issuing advisory bulletins to all hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline operators describing the circumstances of the accident in Marshall, asking them to take appropriate action to eliminate similar deficiencies, to identify deficiencies in facility response plans, and to update these plans as necessary, developing requirements for team training of control center staff involved in pipeline operations similar to those used in other transportation modes, strengthening operator qualification requirements, and harmonizing onshore oil pipeline response planning requirements with those of the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for oil and petroleum products facilities to ensure that operators have adequate resources for worst-case discharges.

On August 9, 2006, the departments signed an annex ""to delineate clear lines of authority and responsibility and promote communications, efficiency, and nonduplication of effort through cooperation and collaboration between the parties in the area of transportation security."" In January 2007, the PHMSA Administrator testified before Congress that the agency had established a joint working group with TSA ""to improve interagency coordination on transportation security and safety matters, and to develop and advance plans for improving transportation security,"" presumably including pipeline security.
Past PHMSA reauthorizations included expansive pipeline safety mandates, such as requirements for the agency to impose integrity management programs, significantly increase inspector staffing, or regulate underground natural storage."

89,"The Reagan Administration had sought to promote change within the apartheid regime—with which it shared anti-communist goals—by engaging it in a dialogue-based approach dubbed ""constructive engagement."" The Trump Administration has not pursued any major changes in bilateral ties, but in late 2018, President Trump acted to fill the post of U.S. ambassador to South Africa, vacant since late 2016, by nominating South African-born luxury handbag designer Lana Marks to the position.
In recent years, congressional engagement with South Africa has mainly focused on oversight of foreign aid program—particularly South Africa's relative progress in building its capacity to address its HIV/AIDS crisis and gradually assuming greater responsibility for HIV program financing and implementation, key goals under PEPFAR.
U.S. Assistance11 According to the State Department's FY2019 foreign aid budget request, South Africa is a key player for U.S. engagement in Africa and a critical partner to boost U.S. trade and economic growth, improve regional security, and mitigate public health crises.
South Africa is the economic and security anchor of the region but grapples with political and socioeconomic challenges, including high-level corruption and poor accountability, a slowing economy, high youth unemployment, critical levels of violent crime, a weak education system, a high rate of HIV/AIDS, water scarcity, and wildlife trafficking.
Since 1994, South Africa has been a top African recipient of U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) aid, the vast majority devoted to PEPFAR and other health programs, including responses to the tuberculosis epidemic and efforts to end child and maternal deaths.
The State Department has proposed to cut PEPFAR funding by 67.6% in FY2020, to $161.8 million, after issuing sharp criticism of the PEPFAR in South Africa in its FY2019 PEPFAR Country Operational Plan ""Planning Level Letter."" While praising a number of successes under the U.S. PEPFAR partnership with the South African government and commending efforts to improve the program, the letter, by U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy Deborah L.
Birx, took note of ""several fundamental problems in PEPFAR's core treatment program in South Africa."" The letter stated Despite a significant infusion of resources by the U.S. government especially over the last three years, progress has been grossly sub-optimal and insufficient to reach epidemic control, including the targets of the Surge Plan [an effort to accelerate HIV testing, treatment, and retention].
Other recent-year U.S. development aid for South Africa has supported programs focusing on basic education; civil society capacity-building aimed at fostering accountable and responsive governance and public service delivery advocacy, and support for the office of the Public Protector [a public ombudsman; see below]; business-government cooperation in support of development; and support for sexual assault and gender-based-violence victims.
Through its Africa Private Capital Group, USAID also facilitates development-focused financing, including though efforts to foster local municipal bond and pension fund investment in public goods and services.
USAID also administers the Trilateral Assistance Program (discussed below), under which the United States supports South African foreign aid efforts in Africa.
South Africa has served as a ""Strategic Partner"" under the Feed the Future U.S. global food security and agricultural development initiative by providing agricultural technical assistance to other African countries.
South Africa also participates in the joint State Department/USAID Young African Leaders Initiative, which helps develop the leadership skills of young business, civic, and public sector professionals.
Some project-centered grant aid is also provided to civil society entities, and South Africa periodically benefits from U.S. regional programs focused on such issues as environmental management and trade capacity-building.
The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program is long-standing, and in past years Foreign Military Financing (FMF) aid has supported the South African military's capacity to respond to regional crises and participate in peacekeeping.
The Zuma administration faced a third legal setback in March 2016, when the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that the government had unlawfully ignored a court order—and violated local and international law obligations—by not detaining then-Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir when he attended a mid-2015 African Union (AU) summit in South Africa.
Global factors contributing to low growth in recent years have included weak investor confidence—attributed to uncertain economic policy trends and alleged poor governance under Zuma—and periods of weak prices and sluggish global demand for key commodity exports, especially to China.
South Africa has a generally open foreign direct investment (FDI) regime, although investors face high taxes, currency exchange volatility, substantial regulatory burdens, large locally entrenched firms, and Black Economic Empowerment policy compliance costs (see below).
It provides training, exchange programs, and funding to support South Africa's provision of technical development assistance to other African countries."
90,"If a state or territory chooses to develop a coastal management program and the program is approved, the state or territory (1) becomes eligible for several federal grants and (2) can perform reviews of federal agency actions in coastal areas (known as federal consistency determination reviews ).
resource protection, management of coastal development, and simplification of governmental processes.""  The Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) must conclude that the state has completed certain tasks (e.g., included required program elements and coordinated with local and regional agencies) to approve the CMP.
Why States and Territories May Choose to Join the NCZMP Participation in the NCZMP provides various benefits to participants, including access to several federal grant programs and the right to review federal actions for consistency with state coastal policies.
Federal Consistency Determination Review CZMA Section 307 requires federal actions that have reasonably foreseeable effects on coastal uses or resources to be consistent with the enforceable policies of a participant's approved CMP."
91,"Introduction The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on certain mortgage loans.
) Because saving for a down payment is often the biggest barrier to homeownership for first-time homebuyers and lower- or moderate-income homebuyers, the smaller down payment requirement for FHA-insured loans may allow some households to obtain a mortgage earlier than they otherwise could.
Over one-third of all FHA loans (both purchase and refinance loans) were obtained by minority households, and FHA-insured mortgages accounted for about 57% of all forward mortgages made to low- or moderate-income borrowers during the year.
FHA increased the actual annual premiums that it charges several times in recent years in order to bring more money into the FHA insurance fund and ensure that it has sufficient funds to pay for defaulted loans.
FHA has stated that, since it continues to insure the entire remaining mortgage amount for the life of the loan, and since premiums were cancelled on the basis of the loan amortizing to a percentage of the initial property value rather than the current value of the home, FHA has at times had to pay insurance claims on defaulted mortgages where the borrowers were no longer paying annual mortgage insurance premiums.
The MMI Fund has historically been estimated to generate negative credit subsidy in the year that the loans are insured and therefore has not required appropriations to cover the expected costs of loans to be insured.
A number of factors may have contributed to this decrease, including lower loan limits in some high-cost areas, higher mortgage insurance premiums, and greater availability of non-FHA-insured mortgages."
92,"The President's request includes continued R&D funding for existing single-agency and multiagency programs and activities, as well as new initiatives.
Under the request, eight federal agencies would receive more than 97% of total federal R&D funding in FY2020: the Department of Defense, 44.3%; Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), primarily the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 25.1%; Department of Energy (DOE), 11.0%; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 8.4%; National Science Foundation (NSF), 4.3%; Department of Agriculture (USDA), 1.8%; Department of Commerce (DOC), 1.3%; and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 1.0%.
(See Table 2 .) President Trump's FY2020 request includes $35.164 billion for basic research, down $1.452 billion (4.0%) from FY2018; $40.707 billion for applied research, down $4.264 billion (10.5%); $59.108 billion for development, up $4.543 billion (8.3%); and $3.382 billion for facilities and equipment, down $495 million (12.8%).
In the President's FY2020 budget request, the Department of Health and Human Services, primarily NIH, would account for nearly half (47.7%) of all federal funding for basic research.
The program seeks to advance global climate change science and to ""build a knowledge base that informs human responses to climate and global change through coordinated and integrated Federal programs of research, education, communication, and decision support."" In FY2018, 13 departments and agencies participated in the USGCRP.
The Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) (P.L. 101-606) requires each federal agency or department involved in global change research to report annually to Congress on each element of its proposed global change research activities, as well as the portion of its budget request allocated to each element of the program.
In addition, in almost each of the past 17 years, language in appropriations laws has required the President to submit a comprehensive report to the appropriations committees ""describing in detail all Federal agency funding, domestic and international, for climate change programs, projects, and activities … including an accounting of funding by agency…."" The President's most recent report was submitted in January 2017 for the FY2017 request.
In particular, the EO directs the Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, Health and Human Services, and Energy, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Director of the National Science Foundation to prioritize the allocation of high-performance computing resources for AI-related applications through increased assignment of discretionary funding and any other appropriate mechanisms.
Department of Defense21 The mission of the Department of Defense is to provide ""the military forces needed to deter war and ensure our nation's security."" Congress supports research and development activities at DOD primarily through the department's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding.
by providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services."" This section focuses on HHS research and development funded through the National Institutes of Health, an HHS agency that accounts for nearly 97% of total HHS R&D funding.
In addition, NIH has received mandatory funding of $150 million annually provided in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), Section 330B, for a special program on type 1 diabetes research.
President Trump's FY2020 budget request would provide NIH a total program level of $34.368 billion, a decrease of $4.941 billion (12.6%) compared with FY2019 enacted levels.
The Administration's FY2020 budget request for DOE includes about $12.783 billion for R&D and related activities, including programs in three broad categories: science, national security, and energy.
NSF has six appropriations accounts: Research and Related Activities (RRA, the main research account), Education and Human Resources (EHR, the main education account), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM), the National Science Board (NSB), and the Office of Inspector General (OIG).
The enacted bill provides $259.0 million to support Hatch Act formula funding for 1862 land grant university research and education activities.
For Cooperative Extension support at 1862 land grant universities under the Smith-Lever Act, Sections (b) and (c) formula funding for FY2019, the enacted appropriation provides a total of $315.0 million for these extension activities.
Congress provides most of the discretionary funding for the line offices and Mission Support through two accounts: (1) Operations, Research, and Facilities, and (2) Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction.
The request includes $120 million for the agency's Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account, a reduction of $71.1 million (37.2%) from FY2019.
The agency's Science and Technology (S&T) appropriations account funds much of EPA's scientific research activities, which include R&D conducted by the agency at its own laboratories and facilities, and R&D and related scientific research conducted by universities, foundations, and other nonfederal entities that receive EPA grants.
With the exception of the Building and Facilities account, the President's FY2020 request proposes funding reductions below FY2019 enacted levels for the nine other EPA appropriations accounts, although funding for some program areas within the accounts would remain constant or increase.
Some Members of Congress expressed concerns regarding proposed reductions of funding for EPA scientific research programs during hearings on the President's FY2020 budget request.
Table 21 at the end of this section includes the President's FY2020 request for program areas and activities within EPA's S&T account as presented in EPA's FY20 20 Congressional Budget Justification compared to the FY2019 enacted appropriations as reported in the Conference Report ( H.Rept.
The FY2020 request for the Operations and Administration program area within the S&T account includes $6.0 million for agency workforce reshaping and efforts to improve the management of EPA's laboratories."
93,"Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils.
Each year since 1989, the House and Senate have agreed to a concurrent resolution allowing the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service to be conducted on Capitol Grounds.
Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall can be divided into one of four categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies, (2) congressional gold medal ceremonies, (3) artwork unveilings, and (4) presidential inauguration activities."
94,"Governance, Human Rights, and Reform The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates (principalities): Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich federation capital; Dubai, a large commercial hub; and the five smaller and less wealthy emirates of Sharjah, Ajman, Fujayrah, Umm al-Qaywayn, and Ras al-Khaymah.
In keeping with a long-standing agreement among the seven emirates, Khalifa was subsequently selected as UAE president by the leaders of all the emirates, who collectively comprise the ""Federal Supreme Council."" The ruler of Dubai traditionally serves concurrently as Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE; that position has been held by Shaykh Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktum, architect of Dubai's modernization drive, since the death of his elder brother Shaykh Maktum bin Rashid Al Maktum in January 2006.
The government has particularly targeted for arrest Islamists linked to the Muslim Brotherhood organization, which UAE leaders named in 2014 as one of 85 ""terrorist organizations""(a list that included Al Qaeda and the Islamic State).
U.S. officials assert that they continue to promote democracy, rule of law, independent media, and civil society in the UAE through State Department programs that are tolerated by the UAE government.
Other Human Rights-Related Issues7 Recent State Department human rights reports and reports by independent groups such as Human Rights Watch assert that there are a variety of human rights problems in the UAE including: unverified reports of torture, government restrictions of freedoms of speech and assembly, and lack of judicial independence.
The 2018 State Department report credits the UAE with implementing reforms that reduce forced labor among foreign workers in the private sector, instituting direct governmental oversight of domestic laborers, increasing the number of labor trafficking prosecutions, and funding and implementing a national action plan to combat trafficking in persons.
Its assertiveness has been enhanced by the training, arms, and advice the country has received from its close security partnership with the United States, forged during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war and strengthened after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The UAE and the five other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman) also have close defense ties to the United States.
The rift has scuttled long-standing GCC plans to establish a joint military command and joint naval force to be based in Bahrain, supported by an Abu Dhabi-based ""Gulf Academy for Strategic and Security Studies."" Saudi Arabia, possibly as an overture, formally invited the Amir of Qatar to the GCC summit of December 7-9, 2018, but the Amir did not attend.
Criticism of the Arab coalition war effort has produced increasing congressional opposition to the U.S. logistical support provided to the effort, which included intelligence and aerial refueling under a cross-servicing agreement, as well as related arms sales and some direct U.S. military action to prevent Iranian weapons flows to the Houthis.
Also in 2015, the UAE expanded its partnership with the fragile government in Somalia to open a new center at which a few hundred UAE special forces trained Somali commandos to counter terrorist groups, particularly Al Shabab.
Defense Cooperation with the United States  The UAE's ability to project power in the region is a product of many years of U.S.-UAE defense cooperation that includes U.S. arms sales and training, strategic planning, and joint exercises and operations.
Some experts say the UAE has joined U.S.-led operations to further invest the United States in UAE security and increase UAE influence over U.S. policy.
Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) and U.S. Forces in UAE  The United States and UAE have established a ""Defense Cooperation Framework"" to develop joint strategic approaches to regional disputes and conflicts and to better integrate U.S. capabilities with those of the UAE.
About 600-800 UAE military personnel study and train in the United States each year, mostly through the Foreign Military Sales program, through which the UAE buys most of its U.S.-made arms.
Within a broader GCC context, joint statements issued after a 2015 and a 2016 U.S.-GCC summit at Camp David announced a new U.S.-GCC strategic partnership in which the United States pledged to (1) facilitate U.S. arms transfers to the GCC states; (2) increase U.S.-GCC cooperation on maritime security, cybersecurity, and counterterrorism; (3) organize additional large-scale joint military exercises and U.S. training; (4) help realize a long-discussed concept of a Gulf-wide ballistic missile defense capability; and (5) U.S.-GCC military exercises and U.S. training for GCC special forces.
In April 2013, the United States sold the UAE an additional 30 F-16s and associated ""standoff"" air-to-ground munitions, in conjunction with similar weapons sales to Israel and Saudi Arabia, which U.S. officials indicated were intended to signal resolve to Iran.
Even though Israel and the UAE are aligned on many regional policies, U.S. officials have said that the United States would not sell the aircraft to the UAE before Israel receives the weapon; delivery to Israel is expected to begin in late 2016.
UAE authorities have arrested and prosecuted Al Qaeda and Islamic State operatives; denounced terror attacks; improved border security; instituted programs to counter violent extremism; instituted laws to block suspect financial transactions; criminalized use of the internet by terrorist groups; and strengthened its bureaucracy and legal framework to combat terrorism.
For example, the 85 groups that the UAE government designates as terrorist organizations include some U.S.- and Europe-based groups that represent Muslims in those societies and which neither the United States nor any European government accuses of terrorism.
The United States Embassy in Abu Dhabi questioned the UAE government about why it designated these groups."
95,"As more states decriminalize the use of marijuana, the question of what impact marijuana usage has on the risk of a driver being involved in a motor vehicle crash has become more pertinent.
Studies of marijuana's impact on a driver's performance have thus far found that, while marijuana usage can measurably affect a driver's performance in a laboratory setting, that effect may not translate into an increased likelihood of the driver being involved in a motor vehicle crash in a real-world setting, where many other variables affect the risk of a crash.
Other state laws, known as per se laws, provide that a driver is automatically guilty of driving while impaired if specified levels of a potentially impairing substance are found in his or her body (e.g., blood alcohol content (BAC) of .08% or higher, or, in some states, THC in the blood; see Table 1 ).
There is as yet no scientifically demonstrated correlation between levels of THC and degrees of impairment of driver performance, and epidemiological studies disagree as to whether marijuana use by a driver results in increased crash risk.
Other studies have estimated the increased crash risk for drivers testing positive for marijuana at between zero and three times that for unimpaired drivers, roughly comparable to the increased crash risk of having a blood alcohol content of between .01% and .05%, well below the legal per se impaired level of .08 BAC.
These include continued research into whether a quantitative standard can be established that correlates the level of THC in a person's body and the level of impairment, and better data on the prevalence of marijuana use by drivers, especially among drivers involved in crashes and drivers arrested for impaired driving."
96,"Currently administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the program provides federal grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs.
829 as passed by the Senate; and H.R. 1571 , the Fire Department Proper Response and Equipment Prioritization Act, which was introduced by Representative Herrera-Beutler and would amend the FIRE Act statute to direct FEMA to give high-priority consideration to grants providing for planning, training, and equipment to firefighters for crude oil-by-rail and ethanol-by-rail derailment and incident response.
Table 2 shows the appropriations history for firefighter assistance, including AFG, SAFER, and the Fire Station Construction Grants (SCG) provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $700 million for firefighter assistance in FY2019, including $350 million for AFG and $350 million for SAFER, with funds to remain available through September 30, 2020.
The SAFER Act authorizes grants to career, volunteer, and combination fire departments for the purpose of increasing the number of firefighters to help communities meet industry minimum standards and attain 24-hour staffing to provide adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards.
According to the report, the ""challenge for the AFG program will be to support a gradual shift in direction without losing major strengths of its current management approach—including industry driven priority setting and its well-respected peer review process."" The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-161 ), in the accompanying Joint Explanatory Statement, directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the application and award process for fire and SAFER grants."
97,"The most general and direct protection of individual privacy is contained in the Fourth Amendment, which states that ""[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated .
Carpenter distinguished earlier cases which had relied upon the principle that information shared with third parties was generally not subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny, concluding that ""an individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy in the record of his physical movements as captured through [his cellular phone]."" The Court's holding means that, in the future, the government must obtain a warrant supported by probable cause to obtain this information.
Under this doctrine, only government action is subject to scrutiny under the Constitution, but purely private conduct is not proscribed, ""no matter how unfair that conduct may be."" As a result, neither the common nor constitutional law provides a complete framework for considering many of the potential threats to digital privacy and consumer data.
These obligations are centered on a category of data called ""consumer"" ""nonpublic personal information"" (NPI), and generally relate to: (1) sharing NPI with third parties, (2) providing privacy notices to consumers, and (3) securing NPI from unauthorized access.
Third, GLBA and its implementing regulations (often referred to as the ""Safeguards Rule"" ) require financial institutions to maintain ""administrative, technical, and physical safeguards"" to ""insure the security and confidentiality"" of ""customer"" (as opposed to ""consumer"") NPI, and to protect against ""any anticipated threats or hazards"" or ""unauthorized access"" to such information.
First, with respect to sharing, HIPAA's privacy regulations generally prohibit covered entities from using PHI or sharing it with third parties without patient consent, unless such information is being used or shared for treatment, payment, or ""health care operations"" purposes, or unless another exception applies.
The Department of Justice has criminal enforcement authority and may seek fines or imprisonment against a person who, in violation of HIPAA's privacy requirements, ""knowingly"" obtains or discloses ""individually identifiable health information"" or ""uses or causes to be used a unique health identifier."" HIPAA does not, however, contain a private right of action that would allow aggrieved individuals to sue alleged violators.
In contrast to HIPAA or GLBA, there are no privacy provisions in FCRA requiring entities to provide notice to a consumer or to obtain his opt-in or opt-out consent before collecting or disclosing the consumer's data to third parties.
For willful violations, consumers may recover either actual damages or statutory damages ranging from $100 to $1,000, attorney's fees, other litigation costs, and ""such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow."" FCRA also imposes criminal liability on any individual who knowingly and willfully obtains consumer information from a CRA under false pretenses and on any officer or employee of a CRA who knowingly and willfully provides consumer information to a person not authorized to receive that information.
The privacy and security requirements imposed on entities acting as common carriers are primarily centered on a category of information referred to as ""customer proprietary network information (CPNI)."" CPNI is defined as information relating to the ""quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of a telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer of a telecommunications carrier,"" and is ""made available to the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship.""  Section 222(c) of the Communications Act and the FCC's implementing regulations set forth carriers' obligations regarding CPNI.
It further maintained that Sections 201(b) and 202(a) provide independent ""backstop authority"" to ensure that no gaps are formed in commercial data privacy and security practices, similar to the FTC's authority under the FTC Act. However, given that Congress overturned the 2016 rule, the FCC may be prohibited under the CRA from relying on these three provisions to regulate data privacy and security.
Along with its general civil and criminal provisions, the Communications Act provides a private right of action for those aggrieved by violations of its common carrier provisions; in such actions, plaintiffs may seek actual damages and reasonable attorney's fees.
Cable Operators and Satellite Carriers In addition to common carriers, the Communications Act imposes a number of data privacy and security requirements on how ""cable operators"" and ""satellite carriers"" (i.e., covered entities) treat their subscribers' ""personally identifiable information"" (PII).
Additionally, covered entities violating these provisions may be subject to FCC civil enforcement and criminal penalties that, as previously noted, are generally applicable to violations of the Communications Act. Video Privacy Protection Act The Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) was enacted in 1988 in order to ""preserve personal privacy with respect to the rental, purchase, or delivery of video tapes or similar audio visual materials."" The VPPA does not have any data security provisions requiring entities to maintain safeguards to protect consumer information from unauthorized access.
The VPPA does not empower any federal agency to enforce violations of the Act and there are no criminal penalties for violations, but it does provide for a private right of action for persons aggrieved by the Act. In such actions, courts may award actual damages, punitive damages, preliminary and equitable relief, and reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation costs.
Among other things, these additional procedures require the FTC to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), give interested persons an opportunity for an informal hearing, and issue a statement accompanying the rule regarding the ""prevalence of the acts or practices treated by the rule."" Consequently, the FTC rarely uses its TRR rulemaking authority and has not enacted any TRRs regarding data protection.
With respect to tort law, in addition to the ""privacy"" causes of action that developed at the state level during the early 20th century (discussed above), negligence and other state tort law claims serve as a means to regulate businesses that are injured from data security issues or otherwise fail to protect their customers from foreseeable harm.
Other legislative proposals have sought to avoid dual layers of regulations by stating that the proposed data protection requirements would not apply to individuals or entities covered by certain existing federal privacy laws.
First Amendment Although legislation on data protection could take many forms, several approaches that would seek to regulate the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information online may have to confront possible limitations imposed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
However, a few commentators have observed that the case will likely have an important effect on the future of privacy regulation, if nothing else, by having all but concluded that First Amendment principles apply to the regulation of the collection, disclosure, and use of personally identifiable information as speech, not conduct.
Except in extreme incidents and cases of government access to personal data, the ""right to privacy"" that developed in the common law and constitutional doctrine provide few safeguards for the average internet user."
98,"In addition, Executive Order (E.O.) 13783 has directed EPA and other federal agencies to review existing regulations and policies that ""potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources"" for consistency with policies that the E.O. enumerates, and as soon as practicable, to ""suspend, revise, or rescind the guidance, or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding those rules."" EPA rules to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants, cars and trucks, and the oil and gas sector have been of particular interest.
EPA's Greenhouse Gas Regulations EPAs regulatory actions to limit GHG emissions have relied on authority that Congress granted the agency in the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1970.
EPA finalized GHG standards for power plants in August 2015; set GHG emission standards for oil and gas industry sources in June 2016; finalized a second round of GHG standards for trucks in August 2016; and completed a Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) of the already promulgated GHG standards for model years 2022-2025 light-duty vehicles (cars and light trucks) in January 2017.
EPA finalized GHG (CO 2 ) emission standards under CAA Section 111 for new, existing, and modified fossil-fueled power plants in August 2015.
New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new and modified power plants, promulgated at the same time as the CPP, would affect fewer plants, but they too are controversial, because of the technology the rule assumed could be used to reduce emissions at new coal-fired units.
Prior to the power sector GHG rules, EPA made two findings under CAA Section 202: (1) that GHGs currently in the atmosphere potentially endanger public health and welfare and (2) that new motor vehicle emissions cause or contribute to that pollution.
While neither ACE nor the 2018 NSPS rule proposes to reconsider the endangerment finding or the conclusions related to the endangerment finding in the 2015 NSPS, the 2018 NSPS requested comments on these issues, ""either as a general matter or specifically applied to GHG emissions."" For example, EPA noted that power sector GHG emissions are declining and requested comment on whether EPA has ""a rational basis for regulating CO 2 emissions from new coal-fired"" units.
Congress anticipated that the understanding of air pollution's effects on public health and welfare would change with time, and it required, in Section 109(d) of the act, that EPA review the NAAQS at five-year intervals and revise them, as appropriate.
The agency is reviewing additional regulations, among them air toxics rules applicable to power plants, brick and ceramic kilns, and industrial sources of ethylene oxide as well as NSPS rules applicable to particulate matter from wood heaters.
Similarly, H.R. 1152 would, among other things, require EPA to revise the MON and commercial sterilization NESHAPs within 180 days, and to base the revision on an EPA report, ""Evaluation of the Inhalation Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide.""  Mercury from Power Plants  EPA is reviewing the benefit-cost analysis it prepared in 2011 for the Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS) rule, raising questions about whether the agency will take additional action on the rulemaking in 2019."
99,"In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of a funding gap may be postponed if it appears that an additional CR or regular appropriations act is likely to be enacted that same day.
In the lead-up to the first funding gap, only 3 out of the 13 regular appropriations acts had been signed into law, and budget authority, which had been provided by a CR since the start of the fiscal year, expired at the end of the day on November 13.
FY2018 At the beginning of FY2018, none of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so the federal government operated under a series of CRs. The first, P.L. 115-56 , provided government-wide funding through December 8, 2017."
100,"These include a strong sense of social cohesion, strong support for the government from both Western powers and the Gulf Arab monarchies, and an internal security apparatus that is highly capable and, according to human rights groups, uses vague and broad criminal provisions in the legal system to dissuade dissent.
According to one Jordanian commentator, ""Domestically, the King's decision is a much-needed shot in the arm for the government at a time when it is facing public pressure over its unpopular economic policies."" Several months later, Jordan expanded the membership of the Islamic Waqf Council (Islamic custodial trust), which Jordan appoints to oversee the administration of Jerusalem's Temple Mount (known by Muslims as the Haram al Sharif or Noble Sanctuary) and its holy sites.
King Abdullah II recently traveled to the United Kingdom, where UK officials pledged to partially guarantee a $1.9 billion World Bank loan to Jordan.
Educated largely in Britain and the United States, King Abdullah II had earlier pursued a military career, ultimately serving as commander of Jordan's Special Operations Forces with the rank of major general.
U.S. Foreign Assistance to Jordan The United States has provided economic and military aid to Jordan since 1951 and 1957, respectively.
Economic Assistance The United States provides economic aid to Jordan for (1) budgetary support (cash transfer), (2) USAID programs in Jordan, and (3) loan guarantees."
101,"A draft framework, in which the Taliban would prohibit terrorist groups from operating on Afghan soil in return for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces, was reached between U.S. and Taliban negotiators in January 2019, though lead U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad insists that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."" Negotiations do not, as of May 2019, directly involve representatives of the Afghan government, leading some to worry that the United States will prioritize a military withdrawal over a complex political settlement that preserves some of the social, political, and humanitarian gains made since 2001.
The United States has contributed approximately $133 billion in various forms of aid to Afghanistan over the past decade and a half, from building up and sustaining the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) to economic development.
After a six-day series of negotiations in Doha in late January 2019, Khalilzad stated that, ""The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals,"" in return for which U.S. forces would eventually fully withdraw from the country.
President Ghani's concern about being excluded from the talks surfaced in mid-March when his national security advisor accused Khalilzad of ""delegitimizing the Afghan government and weakening it,"" and harboring political ambitions within Afghanistan, leading to a shark rebuke from the State Department.
Military and Security Situation  Since early 2015, the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan of 17,000 troops, known as ""Resolute Support Mission"" (RSM), has focused on training, advising, and assisting Afghan government forces."
102,"In his May 28, 2004, report following the vote, Annan said that ""the Greek Cypriots' vote must be respected, but they need to demonstrate willingness to resolve the Cyprus problem through a bicommunal, bizonal federation and to articulate their concerns about security and implementation of the Plan with 'clarity and finality.'"" The Christofias-Talat Negotiations: 2008-2010 As early as 2004, Talat, as Turkish Cypriot ""prime minister,"" was credited with helping convince the Turkish Cypriots to support the Annan Plan and had been seen as perhaps the one Turkish Cypriot leader who could move the Greek Cypriots toward a more acceptable solution for both sides.
After Christofias's election, Turkish Cypriot leader Talat, a long-time acquaintance of Christofias, declared that ""a solution in Cyprus is possible by the end of 2008."" He also declared that ""the goal was to establish a new partnership state in Cyprus, based on the political equality of the two peoples and the equal status of two constituent states."" While the negotiations between Christofias and Talat appeared to get off to a fast start, the differences in positions quickly became apparent, and the talks, although held on a regular basis, soon began to bog down.
Almost immediately, a controversy arose when it was reported that Downer read a statement from U.N. Secretary-General Ban congratulating the parties for starting the talks again from where they left off (including the confirmation of existing convergences agreed to by Christofias and Talat), for agreeing to abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions on Cyprus, and for suggesting that a final agreement could be reached in the coming months.
On the other hand, apparently after the May 26 meeting, Eroglu made a statement that the Turkish Cypriots would not be bound by the statement of the U.N. Secretary-General, especially with regard to previous U.N. Security Council resolutions, some of which did include calls for Turkey to withdraw its troops from Cyprus.
""As time passes,"" he said, ""the willingness of the two communities to live together is diminishing."" For his part, Christofias told the U.N. Secretary-General in September 2010 that both sides were not coming closer to a settlement and that Turkey, given its own domestic and regional problems, ""was not ready to solve the Cyprus problem."" Although assessments of the negotiations appeared to grow more pessimistic, additional sessions were held through the end of December.
Ban had asked both Christofias and Eroglu to come to New York on January 22-24 with significant offers in the areas of governance, economy, and EU affairs so that the ""Greentree 2"" meeting could facilitate a final deal that would allow the U.N. to convene an international conference in the spring to resolve security-related issues and allow referenda on a final agreement in both the north and south by early summer of 2012.
It appeared, however, that even before arriving in New York, neither Christofias nor Eroglu was willing or able to make necessary concessions on the difficult issues of property rights, security, territory, mainland Turks who had ""settled"" in the north, or citizenship—areas where both sides had long-held and very different positions.
The lack of any progress to that point led some in the Greek Cypriot opposition to suggest the meeting be cancelled and warned Christofias not to accept any deadlines or U.N. arbitration or agree to an international conference without explicit agreements on internal issues.
While foreclosing new discussions based on the old Annan Plan, Anastasiades had suggested that the basis of future talks would have to be broad understandings reached in 1977 and 1979 between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leadership at the time as well as a 2006 set of principles agreed to by former Cypriot leaders.
On the other hand, Yiannakis Omirou, then-leader of the parliament, stated that a new national policy was necessary: ""We need to denounce the Turkish stance to the international and European community and redefine the Cyprus problem as a problem of invasion, occupation and violation of international law."" The new policy, Omirou went on, ""must set out the framework for a Cyprus solution and use Cyprus's EU membership and Turkey's EU prospects to exert pressure on Ankara to terminate the island's occupation and accept a solution, in accordance with international and European law."" Initially, the Turkish Cypriots appeared cautious about which negotiating partner they expected to see across the table if and when the talks resumed.
On February 8, 2014, after what appeared to be a significant intervention by the United States, the Cyprus press reported that an agreement on the language of a ""joint declaration"" had been reached and that Anastasiades and Eroglu would meet right away to relaunch the negotiations.
Such a long disagreement first over the need for, and then the language of, the joint statement indicated to many observers that it would continue to be difficult to reach a final solution, particularly in 2014, which marked the 40 th anniversary of the 1974 deployment of Turkish military forces to the island and the 10 th anniversary of the Greek Cypriot vote against the Annan Plan, events that would be observed in very different ways on each side of the island.
These and other reported roadblocks to the negotiations prompted Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras to say in July that no ""significant progress"" had been made and the Turkish Cypriot official for foreign affairs, Ozdil Nami, to suggest ""the peace talks were finished.""  The last meeting between Anastasiades and Eroglu before a break for the summer was held on July 26 and was reportedly a somewhat tense session, with Anastasiades expressing his frustration with the Turkish Cypriot side.
Reacting to Turkey's decision to establish a presence in the Cypriot EEZ, President Anastasiades announced in October that he was withdrawing from the settlement negotiations and declared that the talks would not resume until the Turkish seismic vessel was withdrawn from Cyprus's EEZ and the NAVTEX was rescinded.
Although the Greek Cypriots insisted that all of the island would eventually benefit from any resources exploited in the waters off the coast, they pointed out that energy, under the provisions of the joint statement agreed to earlier, would be considered a ""federal-level"" issue and would become part of the dialogue once an agreement was reached.
The suspension of the talks, precipitated for some by an unnecessary action and a possible overreaction, again raised serious doubts regarding the commitment of both sides to achieve a solution that left one former British foreign secretary stating that ""the international community should accept the reality that there is division and that you have partition.""  Through the first four months of 2015, the talks remained in suspension with Anastasiades continuing to hold that Turkey would have to withdraw its seismic ship, rescind the NAVTEX issued in January, and stop threatening existing energy exploration activities off the southern coast of Cyprus.
For instance, in early September 2015 several Greek Cypriot political parties officially rejected the notion of a bizonal, bicommunal federation as a part of the solution to the Cyprus problem and criticized reported convergences on population size in the north, the rotating presidency, and particularly Turkey's security role.
Some believed that he retained his father's hard-line skepticism of any deal and had suggested that if an agreement was not reached by the end of 2016, a referendum should be held in the north to determine whether the Turkish Cypriots wanted the negotiations to continue in 2017.
The idea was to achieve enough progress by then on many of the basic issues that both sides would then ask the U.N. Secretary-General to convene a five-party conference (with the two Cypriot communities and the security guarantee countries, Greece, Turkey, and the UK) in December to discuss the issue of security guarantees and finalize an agreement.
Although no five-party conference was announced at the U.N. meeting, the two leaders returned to Cyprus and agreed to another series of accelerated sessions in October and November, to further address the issue of territory and to move to a multiparty conference on security guarantees with the intention of finalizing an agreement.
Ankara's decision led some to wonder if its presence at Geneva was merely intended to reinforce Akinci's earlier demands that Anastasiades agree to such a conference or to demonstrate that Turkey, despite Greek Cypriot claims that Ankara was not interested in a solution, was indeed willing to continue negotiations.
The Geneva meetings apparently began on a positive note with what was reported to be a convergence on the sticking point of a rotating presidency and even more public references to a ""United Federal Cyprus."" Nevertheless, on January 11, 2017, when both sides presented their proposed maps for territorial adjustment to the U.N., the negotiations appeared to veer off course.
Apparently realizing that the security-guarantee issue and Turkey's future role in the north would not be resolved, and with Anastasiades's rejection of the introduction of the four freedoms proposal, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu departed Geneva.
Turkey's injection of the four freedoms issue could have been an attempt by Ankara to stall the negotiations until after the April referendum in Turkey, while Akinci still wanted Anastasiades to step back from his reported comments that the Turkish Cypriots had to face the fact of a minority status on the island.
When the two leaders met for their regularly scheduled meeting on February 16, 2017, Akinci insisted that Anastasiades reverse the parliament's decision on a commemoration of the 1950 referendum, claiming the enosis issue underscored Turkish Cypriot concerns for their safety and security after a settlement and reinforced the argument for why Turkish troops should remain in the north.
Following the announcement of the new conference in Crans Montana, U.N. Special Adviser Eide contacted officials of Greece, Turkey, the UK, and the two Cypriot parties to collect the ""bottom line"" positions of all sides on the security guarantee and troop level issues.
For Akinci, it appeared that if he could win enough concessions on issues such as political equality and a rotating presidency, and could be comfortable as a coequal partner in the future of Cyprus, he might have been able to help Turkey make the necessary concessions on security that Ankara may not have been willing to accept otherwise.
President Anastasiades indicated that he was ready to resume the negotiations, and, despite Guterres's assertion that this was not the end of the road, several news outlets reported that comments by Turkish Foreign Minister Cavusoglu suggested a Turkish decision to abandon the U.N. framework (bizonal, bicommunal federation) as a solution to the Cyprus problem and to move on to a ""Plan B."" Several in the Turkish Cypriot government also echoed the theme that negotiations under the current U.N. structure were over.
In May 2018, Akinci, despite his earlier comments regarding a new format for the talks, suggested negotiations could possibly resume from where they left off at Crans Montana if both sides agreed to adopt as a strategic agreement the six-point framework presented by U.N. Secretary-General Guterres on June 30, 2017.
This time, however, the Secretary-General tasked Lute to determine during her consultations whether there were grounds for the two leaders to accept what Guterres referred to as a ""terms of reference"" document that would include his original 2017 six-point framework, those issues on which both sides previously agreed ""convergences"" had been reached, and a road map for when and how new negotiations would be launched.
In April 2016, the Greek foreign minister reportedly suggested that no final agreement on Cyprus could be achieved until all Turkish military forces agreed to leave the island."
103,"The LCS program has been controversial over the years due to past cost growth, design and construction issues with the first LCSs, concerns over the survivability of LCSs (i.e., their ability to withstand battle damage), concerns over whether LCSs are sufficiently armed and would be able to perform their stated missions effectively, and concerns over the development and testing of the modular mission packages for LCSs. The LCS program has been modified or restructured several times over the years, in part to address these issues.
Supporters of procuring one or more LCSs could argue that it could provide a hedge against delays in the FFG(X) program and help the Navy achieve its small surface combatant force-level goal more quickly.
Opponents of this plan might argue that it could weaken the FFG(X) competition by offering the winner a smaller prospective number of FFG(X)s and essentially guaranteeing the LCSs yard that they will build some number of FFG(X)s; substantially increase annual FFG(X) procurement funding requirements so as to procure as many as four to six FFG(X)s per year rather than two per year, which in a situation of finite Department of Defense (DOD) funding could require offsetting reductions in other Navy or DOD programs; and reduce production economies of scale in the FFG(X) program by dividing FFG(X) among two or three designs, and increase downstream Navy FFG(X) operation and support (O&S) costs by requiring the Navy to maintain two or three FFG(X) logistics support systems.
Supporters of this perspective might argue that the costs of the rapid acquisition strategy are not offset by very much in terms of a true reduction in acquisition cycle time, because the first LCS to be equipped with a mission package that had reached IOC (initial operational capability) did not occur until late FY2014—almost 13 years after the LCS program was announced."
104,"Data fro m streamgages informs real-time decisionmaking and long-term planning on issues such as hazard preparations and response, infrastructure design, water use allocations, ecosystem management, and recreation.
Originally titled the National Streamflow Information Program (NSIP), the USGS now designates these streamgages as FPSs. Out of the 4,760 FPS locations identified by the USGS, 3,640 sites were operational in 2018.
The proposed program was to be fully federally funded, conduct intense data collection during floods and droughts, provide regional and national assessments of streamflow characteristics, enhance information delivery, and conduct methods development and research.
The law also directed the program to determine the relationship between long-term streamflow dynamics and climate change, to incorporate principals of adaptive management to assess program objectives, and to integrate data collection activities of other federal agencies (i.e., NOAA's National Drought Information System) and appropriate state water resource agencies.
Funding for streamgages is included in the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program under the USGS Water Resources Mission Area.
While maintaining level funding for FPS and CMF streamgages in FY2019, Congress directed increased funding of $8.5 million for the deployment and operation of NextGen water observing equipment.
The FY2020 budget request states that ""one of the highest goals of the USGS is to maintain long-term stability of a 'Federal needs backbone network' for long-term tracking and forecasting/modeling of streamflow conditions."" Some stakeholders may advocate to maintain the current network as it provides hydrologic information for diverse applications (see section on "" Streamgage Uses "").
If inflation increases costs, level funding may not fully maintain the current operations of FPSs. In addition, 71% of the network, including some FPSs, are funded by other federal and nonfederal partners, which makes those streamgages potentially vulnerable for discontinuation.
While some stakeholders have advocated for Congress to provide full appropriations for FPSs to meet the mandate based on network needs, Congress may consider other funding priorities (e.g., the NextGen system).
Congress may also consider if other federal agencies and nonfederal cooperative partners could provide more funding for FPSs. These entities may not be interested in financing some of the designated streamgages in the FPS network, particularly those in isolated river basins with little anthropogenic activity."
105,"A key aspect of eligibility for major farm revenue support programs is the requirement that a person be ""actively engaged in farming"" (AEF)—that is, that a person contribute either labor or management time (or both) to the farm's operation.
This is followed by a description of a 2015 USDA rule—released subsequent to the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 )—that clarifies what constitutes AEF for nonfamily members of a farming operation, how more than one nonfamily person may qualify as an active farm manager (subject to a limit of three farm managers), and the recordkeeping requirements necessary to meet this new criteria.
In 2004, GAO contended that USDA regulations failed to specify a measurable standard for what constituted ""a significant contribution of active personal management."" Furthermore, GAO argued that, by not specifying such a measurable standard, USDA allowed individuals with little or no involvement in a farming operation to qualify for payments.
Critics contend that current USDA eligibility criteria—especially for providing active personal management—remain broad and subjective and may represent a low threshold to qualify for payments, thus facilitating the creation of partnership members to increase the farm business's payment limit and expand its farm payment receipts.
The resulting USDA rule, published on December 16, 2015, specifies how legal entities comprised, either entirely or in part, of nonfamily members may be determined eligible for payments, based on a contribution of active personal management.
In particular, some advocacy groups suggest that USDA's new rule did not go far enough in tightening AEF criteria and that it continues to allow for a high number of farm managers and associated payment limits for both family and nonfamily farm operations.
These concerns include the lack of specificity in eligibility criteria that continues to allow for as many as three nonfamily farm managers (each, plus their spouses, qualifying for a full payment limit) and no limit on the number of potential farm managers from family-held farm operations."
106,"In April 2015, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution (UNSCR) 2216 demanding that Houthi-Saleh forces end their use of violence and that all Yemeni parties avoid ""further unilateral actions that could undermine the political transition in Yemen."" The United States agreed to provide limited assistance to the coalition military operations, assistance which has evolved over time in response to conditions in the conflict and in light of congressional scrutiny.
For the Trump Administration, U.S. officials have supported the continued defense of Saudi Arabia against Houthi missile and rocket strikes, while also openly calling on coalition members to use air power judiciously to minimize civilian casualties.
The United States will continue to press the coalition and the Republic of Yemen government to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country."" In early February 2019, CENTCOM Commander General Joseph Votel testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding the U.S. role in assisting Saudi Arabia.
The foreign ministers comprising the quad also ""expressed full support for Saudi Arabia and its legitimate national security concerns and called for an immediate end to such attacks by Houthi forces and their allies."" On February 13, 2019, the House passed (248-177) H.J.Res. 37 , a joint resolution ""Directing the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress."" Prior to its passage by the House, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy in which the Administration argued that ""the premise of the joint resolution is flawed"" because the United States has provided only ""limited support to member countries of the Saudi-led coalition"" and U.S. forces providing such intelligence and logistics support are not engaged in hostilities.
In March 2015, President Obama authorized ""the provision of logistical and intelligence support to GCC-led military operations,"" and the Obama Administration announced that the United States would establish ""a Joint Planning Cell with Saudi Arabia to coordinate U.S. military and intelligence support."" U.S. CENTCOM personnel were deployed to provide related support, and U.S. mid-air refueling of coalition aircraft began in April 2015 and ended in November 2018.
According to President Trump's December 2018 letter to Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, U.S. Armed Forces, ""in a non-combat role,""  continued to provide military advice and limited information, logistics, and other support to regional forces combatting the Houthi insurgency in Yemen; however, aerial refueling of regional forces' aircraft ended in November 2018."
107,"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated for emergencies or OCO/GWOT in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities.
A similar pattern occurred, to varying degrees, during the Vietnam War and 1990-1991 Gulf War. During the post-9/11 conflicts, primarily conducted in Afghanistan and Iraq but also in other countries, Congress has, for an extended period and to a much greater degree than in previous conflicts in the 20 th century, appropriated supplemental and specially designated funding over and above the base DOD budget—that is, funding for planned or regularly occurring costs to man, train, and equip the military force.
Shift from Emergency Supplementals to Contingency Funding Congress used supplemental appropriations to provide funds for defense and foreign affairs activities related to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq following 9/11, and each subsequent fiscal year through FY2010.
The foreign affairs agencies began formally requesting OCO/GWOT funding in FY2012, distinguishing between what is referred to as enduring, ongoing or base costs versus any extraordinary, temporary costs of the State Department and USAID in supporting ongoing U.S. operations and policies in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
By designating funding for OCO for certain activities not directly related to contingency operations, Congress and the President can effectively continue to increase topline defense, foreign affairs, and other related discretionary spending without triggering sequestration.
For example, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said if Congress allows the FY2020 and FY2021 defense spending caps to take effect, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which calls for the United States to bolster its military advantage against potential competitors such as Russia and China, ""is not sustainable."" Critics, including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, have described the OCO account as a ""slush fund"" for military and foreign affairs spending unrelated to contingency operations.
Mulvaney, former director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has described the use of OCO funding for base budget requirements as ""budget gimmicks."" Critics argue what was once generally restricted to a fund for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, transporting troops to and through war zones, and distributing foreign aid to frontline states has ""ballooned into an ambiguous part of the budget to which government financiers increasingly turn to pay for other, at times unrelated, costs."" OMB criteria for OCO funding include the combat losses of ground vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment; replenishment of munitions expended in combat operations; facilities and infrastructure in the theater of operations; transport of personnel, equipment, and supplies to and from the theater; among other items and activities.
There's no pretense that it has anything to do with the region."" Others have argued it makes sense for the military to use OCO funding to purchase new aircraft to replace planes used in current conflicts and no longer in production: ""What are the conditions that are making the combatant commanders and those with train/equip authority to say, 'We need more of this?'"" GWOT/OCO Appropriations by Agency, FY2001-FY2019 Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority for war-related and other international emergency or contingency-designated activities since 9/11.
The Obama Administration's FY2012 International Affairs budget request was the first to include a request for OCO funds for ""extraordinary and temporary costs of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan."" At the time, the Administration indicated that the use of this designation was intended to provide a transparent, whole-of-government approach to the exceptional war-related costs incurred in those three countries, thus better aligning the associated military and civilian costs.
Statutes, Guidance, and Regulations The designation of funding as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) is governed by several statues as well as Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance and the Department of Defense (DOD) Financial Management Regulation (FMR).
Funding for certain DOD contingency operations has been moved to the base budget request, and is no longer designated as emergency or OCO/GWOT requirements."
108,"For example, it provides education programs to assist with business formation and expansion; loan guaranty programs to enhance small business owners' access to capital; and programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting, including oversight of the service-disabled veteran-owned small business federal procurement goaling program.
The program consists of a two-day introductory course on entrepreneurship followed by an eight-week, online course to prepare servicemenmbers and military spouses ""for post-service career success as business owners."" Congress provided the SBA's OVBD an additional $7 million in FY2014 to expand the Boots to Business initiative ""nationwide to the 250,000 yearly transitioning servicemembers in all branches of the military."" The initiative's two-day Introduction to Entrepreneurship course is currently offered at 213 military institutions worldwide and is ""a standard portion of the curricula offered at the revised Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to servicemembers."" TAP is administered by the Department of Defense (DOD) in cooperation with the Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Education (DOE), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the SBA.
In addition, the SBA's OVBD administers several programs to assist veteran-owned businesses, including the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities Consortium of Universities, which provides ""experiential training in entrepreneurship and small business management to post-9/11 veterans with disabilities"" at eight universities; the Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship (V-WISE) program, administered through a cooperative agreement with Syracuse University, which offers women veterans a 15-day, online course focused on entrepreneurship skills and the ""language of business,"" followed by a 3-day conference (offered twice a year at varying locations) in which participants ""are exposed to successful entrepreneurs and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and leaders in government"" and participate in courses on business planning, marketing, accounting and finance, operations and production, human resources, and work-life balance; the Operation Endure and Grow Program, administered through a cooperative agreement with Syracuse University, which offers an eight-week online training program ""focused on the fundamentals of launching and/or growing a small business"" and is available to National Guard members and reservists and their family members; the Boots to Business initiative, which is ""an elective track within the Department of Defense's revised Training Assistance Program called Transition Goals, Plans, Success (Transition GPS) and has three parts: the Entrepreneurship Track Overview —a 10-minute introductory video shown during the mandatory five-day Transition GPS course which introduces entrepreneurship as a post-service career option; Introduction to Entrepreneurship —a two-day classroom course on entrepreneurship and business fundamentals offered as one of the three Transition GPS elective tracks; and Foundations of Entrepreneurship —an eight-week, instructor-led online course that offers in-depth instruction on the elements of a business plan and tips and techniques for starting a business""; the Boots to Business: Reboot initiative, which expanded the Boots to Business initiative in 2014 to include veterans of all eras, active duty servicemembers (including National Guard and Reserves), and their partner/spouse; the Veterans Institute for Procurement (VIP) program, which is designed to increase the ability of veteran-owned businesses to win government contracts by providing ""an accelerator-like, in-residence educational training program for owners, principals, and executives of veteran-owned businesses, consisting of a three-day comprehensive certification program instructed by professional service experts, government officials, and agency representatives""; and the VBOC program, which provides veterans and their spouse management and technical assistance training at 22 locations, including assistance with the Boots to Business initiatives, the development and maintenance of a five-year business plan, and referrals to other SBA resource partners when appropriate for additional training or mentoring services.
At that time, several Members of Congress argued that ""the needs of veterans have been diminished systematically at the SBA"" as evidenced by the agency's elimination of direct loans, including direct loans to veterans, in 1995; and a decline in the SBA's ""training and counseling for veterans … from 38,775 total counseling sessions for veterans in 1993 to 29,821 sessions in 1998."" To address these concerns, the act authorized the establishment of the federally chartered National Veterans Business Development Corporation (known as the Veterans Corporation and reconstituted, without a federal charter, in 2012 as Veteranscorp.org).
It also required the SBA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with SCORE to, among other things, establish ""a program to coordinate counseling and training regarding entrepreneurship to veterans through the chapters of SCORE throughout the United States."" In addition, it directed the SBA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with small business development centers, the VA, and the National Veterans Business Development Corporation ""with respect to entrepreneurial assistance to veterans, including service-disabled veterans."" The act specified that the following services were to be provided: (1) Conducting of studies and research, and the distribution of information generated by such studies and research, on the formation, management, financing, marketing, and operation of small business concerns by veterans.
The SBA's OVBD was established to address these statutory requirements by promoting ""veterans' small business ownership by conducting comprehensive outreach, through program and policy development and implementation, ombudsman support, coordinated agency initiatives, and direct assistance to veterans, service-disabled veterans, reserve and National Guard members, and discharging active duty service members and their families."" As mentioned previously, the OVBD provides, or supports third parties to provide, management and technical assistance training services to more than 100,000 veterans each year.
The bill was designed to enhance oversight and coordination of the SBA's management and technical assistance training programs by requiring the SBA to coordinate these programs ""with State and local economic development agencies and other federal agencies as appropriate"" and to ""report annually to Congress, in consultation with other federal departments and agencies as appropriate, on opportunities to foster coordination, limit duplication, and improve program delivery for federal entrepreneurial development activities."" In a related development, as mentioned previously, the Obama Administration formed the Interagency Task Force for Veterans Small Business Development by executive order on April 26, 2010.
The rationale seems to be … the banks in general seem to be tightening the credit, their lending practices, so that is … what we are hearing."" More recently, GAO reported in 2013 that ""selected loan recipients, lenders, and veteran service organizations said that a low awareness of the Patriot Express program among the military community was among the most frequently cited challenges."" No empirical assessments of veterans' experiences with either the SBA's Patriot Express or SBAExpress loan programs exist that would be useful for determining the relative ease or difficulty for veteran-owned small business owners of accessing capital through the SBA's loan programs.
2273 , would have authorized the SBA to provide up to $1.5 million in grants annually ""from amounts made available to the Office of Veterans Business Development"" to organizations to create and operate business incubators and accelerators that provide technical assistance and training to veterans (including their spouse and dependents) to enable them ""to effectively transfer relevant skills to launch and accelerate small business concerns owned and controlled by covered individuals; and to create an avenue for high-performing covered individuals to meet and collaborate on business ideas."" During the 115 th Congress, S.
For example, the SBA's veteran business development programs, loan guaranty programs, and federal procurement programs for small businesses generally, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, have all been subject to congressional hearings during the past several Congresses."
109,"Introduction and Background The federal child nutrition programs provide assistance to schools and other institutions in the form of cash, commodity food, and administrative support (such as technical assistance and administrative funding) based on the provision of meals and snacks to children.
Though exact eligibility rules and pricing vary by program, in general the amount of federal reimbursement is greater for meals served to qualifying low-income individuals or at qualifying institutions, although most programs provide some subsidy for all food served.
Unless stated otherwise, participation and funding data come from USDA-FNS's ""Keydata Reports.""  Authorization and Reauthorization The child nutrition programs are most often dated back to the 1946 enactment of the National School Lunch Act, which created the National School Lunch Program, albeit in a different form than it operates today.
At the state level, education, health, social services, and agriculture departments all have roles; at a minimum, they are responsible for approving and overseeing local providers such as schools, summer program sponsors, and child care centers and day care homes, as well as making sure they receive the federal support they are due.
At the local level, program benefits are provided to millions of children (e.g., there were 30.0 million in the National School Lunch Program, the largest of the programs, in FY2017), through some 100,000 public and private schools and residential child care institutions, nearly 170,000 child care centers and family day care homes, and just over 50,000 summer program sites.
Cash Reimbursements and Commodity Foods In the meal service programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, summer programs, and assistance for child care centers and day care homes, federal aid is provided in the form of statutorily set subsidies (reimbursements) paid for each meal/snack served that meets federal nutrition guidelines.
General Characteristics The federal school meals programs provide federal support in the form of cash assistance and USDA commodity foods; both are provided according to statutory formulas based on the number of reimbursable meals served in schools.
The subsidized meals are served by both public and private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools and residential child care institutions (RCCIs) that opt to enroll and guarantee to offer free or reduced-price meals to eligible low-income children.
All students can receive a meal at a NSLP- or SBP-participating school, but how much the child pays for the meal and/or how much of a federal reimbursement the state receives will depend largely on whether the child qualifies for a ""free,"" ""reduced-price,"" or ""paid"" (i.e., advertised price) meal.
In the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization ( P.L. 108-265 ), states were required under federal law to conduct direct certification for SNAP participants, with nationwide implementation taking effect in school year 2008-2009.
(Although this report focuses on the programs that serve children, one child nutrition program (CACFP) also serves day care centers for chronically impaired adults and elderly persons under the same general per-meal/snack subsidy terms.) The programs in the sections to follow serve comparatively fewer children and spend comparatively fewer federal funds than the school meal programs.
CACFP provides federal reimbursements for breakfasts, lunches, suppers, and snacks served in participating centers (facilities or institutions) or day care homes (private homes).
The eligibility test for these sites is that 50% or more of the children enrolled in the sponsor's program must be eligible for free or reduced-price school meals based on household income."
110,"The United States plays a significant role in the world oil market, not only as the top consumer of crude oil and petroleum products, but also as the largest producer.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that the United States surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's number one crude oil producer in 2018.
Congress may consider policies that affect the world oil market, including sanctions, alternative fuel standards, emission controls, use of electric vehicles, and protection of international trade routes.
The United States, both the top oil producer and the world's greatest consumer of crude oil and petroleum products (e.g., gasoline), remains a net oil importer.
In a world context, in September 2018, the EIA estimated that the United States surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the number one crude oil producer.
U.S. Demand The United States is the number one consumer of crude oil and refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel.
At the Permian Basin, according to the EIA, ""operators can continue to drill through several tight oil layers and increase production even with sustained West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices below $50 per barrel (bbl)."" While also cost competitive, production from the Bakken and Eagle Ford (south Texas) formations may be more economic with sustained prices above $50/bbl (at 2018 infrastructure, market, technology, and cost conditions).
In addition to economic growth or decline, the world oil supply is influenced by a number of drivers, including project investments, the price of oil, demand forecasts, and geopolitics.
Venezuela, for example, has significantly decreased its crude oil production (due in part to a lack of investment and other contributing factors) while the United States has become the number one producer.
The EIA estimated that the United States surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's number one crude oil producer in 2018.
While the EIA projects the United States, Brazil, and Canada to drive supply growth through 2023, a number of other countries may experience production declines.
The IEA projects the United States, Norway, Brazil, and Canada to provide the largest new non-OPEC crude exports to the world market."
111,"Introduction  This report provides an overview of the federal response to domestic violence—defined broadly to include acts of physical and nonphysical violence against spouses and other intimate partners—through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA).
ACF administers most FVPSA programming, including grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes to support local organizations that provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their children.
FVPSA was the first federal law to address domestic violence, with a focus on providing shelter and services for survivors; however, since the enactment of VAWA in 1994, the federal response to domestic violence has expanded to involve multiple departments and activities that include investigating and prosecuting crimes and providing additional services to victims and abusers.
(The FVPSA regulations also define these terms as generally consistent with VAWA, but recognize that the term ""dating violence"" encompasses additional acts.) The VAWA definition of ""domestic violence"" encompasses forms of intimate partner violence—involving current and former spouses or individuals who are similarly situated to a spouse, cohabiting individuals, and parents of children in common—that are outlawed under state or local laws.
Grants were authorized for states, territories, and Indian tribes to establish and expand programs to prevent domestic violence and provide shelter for victims.
Over time, FVPSA was expanded to include support of other activities, including state domestic violence coalitions and grants that focus on prevention activities; however, authorization of funding for FVPSA law enforcement training grants was discontinued in 1992, just before the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 authorized a similar purpose.
As originally implemented, the program provided funding and technical assistance to 14 state domestic violence coalitions to support local efforts to carry out prevention strategies and work at the state level to oversee these strategies.
FVPSA requires that the hotline provide information and assistance to adult and youth victims of domestic violence, family and household members of victims of such violence, and ""persons affected by victimization."" This includes support related to domestic violence, children exposed to domestic violence, sexual assault, intervention programs for abusive partners, and related issues.
Overview of Shelter, Services, and Support Funding for shelter, support services, and program support (hereinafter, shelter and services) encompasses multiple activities: formula grants to states and territories; grants to tribes; state domestic violence coalitions; national and special issue resource centers, including those that provide technical assistance; specialized services for abused parents and children exposed to domestic violence; and program support and administration.
In funding subgrantees, states must ""give special emphasis"" to supporting community-based projects of ""demonstrated effectiveness"" carried out by nonprofit organizations that operate shelters for victims of domestic violence and their dependents; or that provide counseling, advocacy, and self-help services to victims.
SDVCs must use FVPSA funding for specific activities, as follows: working with local domestic violence service programs and providers of direct services to encourage appropriate and comprehensive responses to domestic violence against adults or youth within the state, including providing training and technical assistance and conducting needs assessments; participating in planning and monitoring the distribution of subgrants and subgrant funds within the state under the grant program for states and territories; working in collaboration with service providers and community-based organizations to address the needs of domestic violence victims and their dependents who are members of racial and ethnic minority populations and underserved populations; collaborating with and providing information to entities in such fields as housing, health care, mental health, social welfare, or business to support the development and implementation of effective policies, protocols, and programs that address the safety and support needs of adult and youth victims of domestic violence; encouraging appropriate responses to cases of domestic violence against adult and youth victims, including by working with judicial and law enforcement agencies; working with family law judges, criminal court judges, child protective service agencies, and children's advocates to develop appropriate responses to child custody and visitation issues in cases of children exposed to domestic violence, and in cases where this violence is concurrent with child abuse; providing information to the public about prevention of domestic violence and dating violence, including information targeted to underserved populations; and collaborating with Indian tribes and tribal organizations (and Native Hawaiian groups or communities) to address the needs of Indian (including Alaska Native) and Native Hawaiian victims of domestic dating violence, as applicable in the state.
Multiple FVPSA activities address children exposed to domestic and related violence: One of the purposes of the formula grant program for states is to provide specialized services (e.g., counseling, advocacy, and other assistance) for these children.
Since VAWA's enactment, the federal response to domestic violence has expanded to involve multiple departments and activities that include investigating and prosecuting crimes, providing additional services to victims and abusers, and educating the criminal justice system and other stakeholders about violence against women."
112,"Employers in states with programs approved by the U.S. Labor Secretary and with no outstanding federal loans may credit up to 5.4 percentage points of state unemployment taxes paid against the 6.0% tax rate, making the minimum net federal unemployment tax rate 0.6%.
If the state chooses to borrow funds from the UTF, not only will the state be required to continue paying benefits, it also will be required to repay the funds (plus any interest due) it has borrowed from the federal loan account within a few years.
1. Revenue from additional FUTA taxes paid by employers when a reduced credit against federal unemployment taxes exists because the state has an outstanding unpaid loan from FUA is deposited into the FUA.
The state's employers will pay the additional federal taxes resulting from the credit reduction no later than January 31 of the next calendar year."
113,"Although the President's budget request, the House committee-reported HUD appropriations bill, and the Senate bill all included different funding levels for voucher renewals for FY2019, each purported to provide enough to fund all vouchers currently in use.
Both the House committee-passed bill and the Senate bill proposed more funding than requested, but neither proposed the full amount the President's budget estimated would be needed to fully fund PHAs' formula eligibility in CY2019.
The final HUD appropriations law provided $4.65 billion for operating funding in FY2019, which is more than the House committee-passed bill, but less than the Senate level."
114,"Introduction The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).
In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by federal dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve.
Current Issues BPA has initiated strategies and a financial plan to address a changing power generation and demand market, as it endeavors to meet its mandate for cost-based electric power rates.
It is the smallest PMA, with just over 40 employees, and, unlike the other three agencies, SEPA does not operate or maintain any transmission facilities, and thus contracts with other utilities for transmitting the federal power it markets to more than 12 million consumers."
115,"The State Department stated that ""observers considered [the municipal council elections] free and fair."" Human Rights Issues7 Recent State Department reports identify the most significant human rights problems in the country as limits on the ability of citizens to choose their government in free and fair elections; restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association, including prohibitions on political parties and labor unions; restrictions on the rights of expatriate workers; and criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual activity.
In 2013-2014, differences over this and other issues widened to the point where Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors from Doha in March 2014, accusing Qatar of supporting ""terrorism."" The Ambassadors returned in November 2014 in exchange for a reported pledge by Qatar to fully implement a November 2013 ""Riyadh Agreement"" that committed Qatar to noninterference in the affairs of other GCC states and to refrain from supporting Muslim Brotherhood-linked organizations.
On June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain, joined by Egypt and a few other Muslim countries, severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, expelled Qatar's diplomats, recalled their ambassadors, and imposed limits on the entry and transit of Qatari nationals and vessels in their territories, waters, and airspace.
On June 22, 2017, the Saudi-led group presented Qatar with 13 demands, including closing Al Jazeera, severing relations with the Muslim Brotherhood, scaling back relations with Iran, closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, and paying reparations for its actions.
The Saudi-led group subsequently reframed its demands as six ""principles,"" among which were for Qatar to ""combat extremism and terrorism"" and prevent their financing, suspend ""all acts of provocation,"" fully comply with the commitments Qatar made in 2013 and 2014 (see above), and refrain ""from interfering in the internal affairs of states.""  President Trump initially responded to the crisis by echoing the Saudi-led criticism of Qatar's policies, but later sought to settle the rift.
Amir Tamim attended both U.S.-GCC summits (May 2015 at Camp David and April 2016 in Saudi Arabia) that addressed GCC concerns about the July 2015 U.S.-led multilateral agreement on Iran's nuclear program (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA).
Syria, Iraq, and Anti-Islamic State Operations In Syria, Qatar provided funds and weaponry to rebels fighting the regime of President Bashar Al Asad, including those, such as Ahrar Al Sham, that competed with and sometimes fought anti-Asad factions supported by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
The January 2018 Strategic Dialogue resulted in a number of U.S.-Qatar announcements of expanded defense and security cooperation, including Qatari offers to fund capital expenditures that offer the possibility of an ""enduring"" U.S. military presence in Qatar and to discuss the possibility of ""permanent [U.S.] basing"" there.
After a long delay reportedly linked to the U.S. commitment to Israel's ""Qualitative Military Edge"" (QME), on November 17, 2016, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified Congress of the potential sale, which has an estimated value of $21 billion.
On June 14, 2017, the United States and Qatar signed an agreement for a reported 36 of the F-15 fighters, which predated (and therefore were not covered by) then-Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Bob Corker's June 26, 2017 announcement that he would not provide informal concurrence to arms sales to the GCC countries until the intra-GCC rift was resolved.
On November 27, 2018, DSCA notified Congress of a State Department approval of a commercial sale by Raytheon of 40 National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NADSAMS) at an estimated value of $215 million.
Perhaps in part as a means to attract U.S. support in the context of the intra-GCC rift, on July 10, 2017, Qatar's foreign minister and then-Secretary Tillerson signed in Doha a Memorandum of Understanding on broad U.S.-Qatar counterterrorism cooperation, including but going beyond just combatting terrorism financing.
According to the State Department's report on international terrorism for 2015, entities and individuals within Qatar continue to serve as a source of financial support for terrorist and violent extremist groups, particularly regional Al Qa'ida affiliates such as the Nusrah Front."" The State Department report for 2017 stated: ""While the Government of Qatar has made progress on countering the financing of terrorism, terrorist financiers within the country are still able to exploit Qatar's informal financial system."" The United States has imposed sanctions on several persons living in Qatar, including Qatari nationals, for allegedly raising funds or making donations to both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.
Its gas industry gives Qatar some counter leverage against the Saudi-led group, but Qatar has said it will not reduce its gas supplies under existing agreements with other GCC states."
116,"With the states continuing as the primary insurance regulators, following Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve exercised holding company oversight over insurers who owned a bank subsidiary or who were designated for enhanced supervision (popularly known as systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs) by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).
The FIO is not a federal insurance regulator, but is tasked with representing the United States in international fora and, along with the United States Trade Representative (USTR), can negotiate international covered agreements relating to insurance prudential measures.
As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United States helped lead the conclusion of negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in 1994, thus creating the first and only multilateral framework of principles and rules for government policies and regulations affecting trade in services among the 164 WTO countries.
In addition to market access, national treatment, and MFN obligations, FTAs include WTO-plus obligations, such as increased transparency by providing interested persons from one party the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations of another party; allowing foreign providers to supply new financial services if domestic companies are permitted to do so; and providing access to public payment and clearing systems.
In further contrast, as mentioned previously, international agreements entered into by federal financial regulators, such as the Basel Capital accords in banking, have no specific congressional notification requirements, but must be implemented through the rulemaking process.
To address concerns among U.S. insurance firms that their market access to the EU would become limited due to changes in EU regulatory policy, in November 2015, the Obama Administration notified Congress regarding plans to begin negotiations with the EU on a covered agreement.
According to the USTR and Treasury, the bilateral agreement allows U.S. and EU insurers to rely on their home country regulators for worldwide prudential insurance group supervision when operating in either market; eliminates collateral and local presence requirements for reinsurers meeting certain solvency and market conduct conditions; and encourages information sharing between insurance supervisors.
The AIA's senior vice president and general counsel noted that, ""when negotiations began, U.S. insurance and reinsurance groups were facing growing obstacles to their ability to do business in Europe, but this agreement removes those barriers—affirming not only each other's regulatory systems, but also their commitments to non-discriminatory treatment and open, reciprocal, competitive insurance markets.""  State regulators and state lawmakers , respectively represented by the NAIC and National Council of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL), expressed concern with the agreement due to the limited state involvement in the negotiation process and the potential federal preemption of state laws and regulations.
NCOIL expressed disappointment with the final signing, stating ""this agreement is an intrusion by both the federal government and international regulatory authorities into the U.S. state based regulation of insurance regulation."" Some insurers also question the utility of the agreement, with the president of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC) seeing ambiguity that ""will result in confusion and potentially endless negotiations with Europe on insurance regulation."" As mentioned, the agreement includes a review after an initial implementation period, at which time either the United States or EU may pull out of the agreement.
A Council of the EU representative indicated that ""an agreement with the U.S. will greatly facilitate trade in reinsurance and related activities"" and would ""enable us, for instance, to recognize each other's prudential rules and help supervisors exchange information."" The European Union, Solvency II, and Equivalency The covered agreement also aims to assist U.S. insurers concerned with potential regulatory burdens in relation to EU market requirements that went into effect in 2016.
Congress may choose to address these issues in multiple ways including, for example, amending Dodd-Frank and the statutory role of FIO and the USTR in international insurance negotiations; legislating an increased role for states in U.S. representation to international insurance regulatory entities; endorsing international insurance standards and legislating their adoption by states; encouraging additional covered agreements to address the countries not covered by the current ones; or encouraging the inclusion of insurance services as part of negotiations of potential free trade agreements."
117,"Section 123 of the AEA requires that any agreement for nuclear cooperation meet nine nonproliferation criteria and that the President submit any such agreement to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
The President must also make a written determination ""that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security."" Requirements Under the Atomic Energy Act Section 123 of the AEA specifies the necessary steps for engaging in nuclear cooperation with another country.
These include guarantees that safeguards on transferred nuclear material and equipment continue in perpetuity; International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) comprehensive safeguards are applied in nonnuclear weapon states; nothing transferred is used for any nuclear explosive device or for any other military purpose; the United States has the right to demand the return of transferred nuclear materials and equipment, as well as any special nuclear material produced through their use, if the cooperating state detonates a nuclear explosive device or terminates or abrogates an IAEA safeguards agreement; there is no retransfer of material or classified data without U.S. consent; physical security on nuclear material is maintained; there is no enrichment or reprocessing by the recipient state of transferred nuclear material or nuclear material produced with materials or facilities transferred pursuant to the agreement without prior approval; storage for transferred plutonium and highly enriched uranium is approved in advance by the United States; and any material or facility produced or constructed through use of special nuclear technology transferred under the cooperation agreement is subject to all of the above requirements.
Section 102a.(2)(A) of the law states that ""no license may be issued for the export, and no approval may be given for the transfer or retransfer"" of ""any nuclear material, facilities, components, or other goods, services, or technology that are or would be subject to an agreement for cooperation between the United States"" and such countries.
Section 133 states that, before approving a subsequent arrangement involving certain transfers of special nuclear material, the Secretary of Energy must consult with the Secretary of Defense ""on whether the physical protection of that material during the export or transfer will be adequate to deter theft, sabotage, and other acts of international terrorism which would result in the diversion of that material."" If the Secretary of Defense determines that ""the export or transfer might be subject to a genuine terrorist threat,"" that Secretary is required to provide a written risk assessment of the risk and a ""description of the actions"" that he or she ""considers necessary to upgrade physical protection measures."" Examples of Subsequent Arrangements U.S.-Japan Agreement The first test of the subsequent arrangement provisions came in August 1978, when the Department of Energy informed the House and Senate foreign relations committees of a Japanese request for approval of the transfer of spent fuel assemblies from Japan to the United Kingdom for reprocessing.
The President can waive termination of exports if he determines that ""cessation of such exports would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of United States nonproliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security."" The President must submit his determination to Congress, which is then referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 60 days of continuous session."
118,"The SBA has argued that its support of management and technical assistance training for small businesses has contributed ""to the long-term success of these businesses and their ability to grow and create jobs."" It currently provides financial support to about 14,000 resource partners, including 63 small business development centers (SBDCs) and nearly 900 SBDC local outreach locations, 128 women's business centers (WBCs), and 350 chapters of the mentoring program, SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives).
The House Committee on Small Business has argued that the SBA's various management and technical assistance training programs should be ""folded into the mission of the SBDC program or their responsibilities should be taken over by other agencies"" because they ""overlap each other and duplicate the educational services provided by other agencies."" Congress has also explored ways to improve the SBA's measurement of these programs' effectiveness.
This report examines the historical development of federal small business management and technical assistance training programs; describes their current structures, operations, and budgets; and assesses their administration and oversight, including measures used to determine their effectiveness.
The bill would have required the SBA to only use authorized entrepreneurial development programs (SCORE, WBCs, SBDCs, etc.) to deliver specified entrepreneurial development services; added data collection and reporting requirements for SBDCs; authorized to be appropriated $21.75 million for WBCs for each of FY2018-FY2021 (WBCs were appropriated $18.0 million in FY2018); increased the WBC annual grant award from not more than $150,000 to not more than $185,000 (adjusted annually to reflect change in inflation); authorized the award of an additional $65,000 to WBCs under specified circumstances; authorized the SBA to waive, in whole or in part, the WBC nonfederal matching requirement for up to two consecutive fiscal years under specified circumstances; modified SCORE program requirements with respect to the role of participating volunteers, program plans and goals, and reporting; and added language concerning the provision and reporting of online counseling by SCORE.
SBDCs were to ""rely on the private sector primarily, and the university community, in partnership with the SBA and its other programs, to fill gaps in making quality management assistance available to the small business owner."" Although most SBDCs continued to be affiliated with universities, the legislation authorized the SBA to provide funding  to any State government or any agency thereof, any regional entity, any State-chartered development, credit or finance corporation, any public or private institution of higher education, including but not limited to any land-grant college or university, any college or school of business, engineering, commerce, or agriculture, community college or junior college, or to any entity formed by two or more of the above entities.
SBDC funding is allocated on a pro rata basis among the states (defined to include the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa) by a statutory formula ""based on the percentage of the population of each State, as compared to the population of the United States."" If, as is currently the case, SBDC funding exceeds $90 million, the minimum funding level is ""the sum of $500,000, plus a percentage of $500,000 equal to the percentage amount by which the amount made available exceeds $90 million."" In 1984, P.L. 98-395 , the Small Business Development Center Improvement Act of 1984, required SBDCs, as a condition of receiving SBA funding, to contribute a matching amount equal to the grant amount, and that the match must be provided by nonfederal sources and be comprised of not less than 50% cash and not more than 50% of indirect costs and in-kind contributions.
Today, the SBA provides grants to SBDCs that are ""hosted by leading universities, colleges, and state economic development agencies"" to deliver management and technical assistance training ""to small businesses and nascent entrepreneurs (pre-venture) in order to promote growth, expansion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement."" These services are delivered, in most instances, on a nonfee, one-on-one confidential counseling basis and are administered by 63 lead service centers, one located in each state (four in Texas and six in California), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.
Also, H.R. 1774 , the Developing the Next Generation of Small Businesses Act of 2017, introduced during the 115 th Congress, among other provisions, would have required the SBA to only use authorized entrepreneurial development programs (SCORE, WBCs, SBDCs, etc.) ""to deliver entrepreneurial development services, entrepreneurial education, support for the development and maintenance of clusters, or business training"" and would have added SBDC data collection and reporting requirements.
Microloan Technical Assistance Program Congress authorized the SBA's Microloan lending program in 1991 ( P.L. 102-140 , the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992) to address the perceived disadvantages faced by women, low-income, veteran, and minority entrepreneurs and business owners gaining access to capital for starting or expanding their business.
In addition, it required the SBA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with SCORE to, among other things, establish ""a program to coordinate counseling and training regarding entrepreneurship to veterans through the chapters of SCORE throughout the United States."" The act also directed the SBA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with SBDCs, the Department of Veteran Affairs, and the National Veterans Business Development Corporation ""with respect to entrepreneurial assistance to veterans, including service-disabled veterans."" It specified, among other things, that the SBA conduct and distribute studies on the formation, management, financing, marketing, and operation of small business concerns by veterans; provide training and counseling on these topics to veterans; assist veterans regarding procurement opportunities with federal, state, and local agencies, especially agencies funded in whole or in part with federal funds; and provide internet or other distance-learning academic instruction for veterans in business subjects, including accounting, marketing, and business fundamentals.
The Veterans Business Outreach Centers (VBOC) program provides veterans and their spouses management and technical assistance training at 22 locations, including assistance with the Boots to Business program, the development and maintenance of a five-year business plan, and referrals to other SBA resource partners when appropriate for additional training or mentoring services."
119,"At the same time, all four states are estimated to receive a smaller percentage share of Basic Grants than of overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Basic Grant formula is less favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be."
120,"A few years later, Congress enacted the Federal Firearms Act of 1938 (FFA), which created a licensing scheme for the manufacture, importation, and sale of firearms and established limited categories of persons who could not possess firearms.
For instance, the Firearm Owners' Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA) carved out exceptions to the felony firearm prohibition for certain crimes, repealed certain regulations pertaining to ammunition, expressly prohibited the creation of a national gun registry, added additional categories of persons who are barred from possessing firearms, prohibited the private possession of machineguns manufactured on or after the date of FOPA's enactment, and further expanded the available criminal penalties for violations, among other things.
United States that this forced disclosure of potentially incriminating information violated the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides in part that no person ""shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself[.]"" Haynes prompted Congress to amend the statute to make clear, among other things, that no information from registration records that are required to be submitted or retained by a natural person may be used as evidence against that person in a criminal proceeding for a violation of law occurring prior to or concurrently with the filing of the records, unless the prosecution relates to the furnishing of false information.
Gun Control Act of 1968 Congress passed the GCA in the wake of the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy to ""keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency and to assist law enforcement authorities in the states and their subdivisions in combating the increasing prevalence of crime in the United States."" Among other things, the statute represented ""a Congressional attempt to stem the traffic in dangerous weapons being used in an increasing number of crimes involving personal injury."" As enacted, the GCA expanded the existing licensing scheme for the manufacture, importation, and sale of firearms and augmented a previously enacted prohibition on the possession of firearms by certain categories of persons (including felons and ""mental defective[s]"").
Major components of the GCA and related supplementing statutes are discussed below, focusing on (1) licensing requirements for firearm manufacturers and dealers, (2) prohibitions on firearm possession, (3) background checks for firearm purchases, (4) interstate firearm sales and transfers, and (5) penalties.
Specifically, a person is prohibited if he or she is a felon (i.e., someone who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year); is a fugitive from justice; is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, any controlled substance; has been adjudicated as a ""mental defective"" or committed to a mental institution; has been admitted to the United States pursuant to a nonimmigrant visa or is an unlawfully present alien; has been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces; has renounced his or her U.S. citizenship; is subject to a court order preventing that person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner (or that partner's child) or engaging in other conduct that would cause the partner to reasonably fear bodily injury to himself or herself or the child; or has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
The prohibition on firearm possession by those who unlawfully use or are addicted to controlled substances also raises the question of what it means to be an ""unlawful user"" or ""addicted."" Regulations define the terms as including those who have ""lost the power of self-control with reference to the use of [a] controlled substance,"" as well as ""current user[s]"" of a controlled substance ""in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician."" The regulations make clear that one need not be using a controlled substance ""at the precise time"" a firearm is sought so long as use has occurred ""recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct."" Prosecutions and court decisions appear to focus on the term unlawful user , which establishes a lower disability threshold than ""addict[]."" Cases interpreting the term ""typically discuss two concepts: contemporaneousness and regularity,"" requiring that there be some ""pattern"" and ""recency"" of controlled-substance use.
In response to the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, ATF recently amended the regulatory definition of machinegun for purposes of the NFA and GCA to include bump-stock-type devices, i.e., devices that ""allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger."" The amended definition is effective as of March 26, 2019, rendering possession of bump-stock-type devices illegal (subject to exceptions) as of that date pursuant to the machinegun prohibition.
Background Checks for Firearm Purchases Overview The Brady Act requires FFLs—but not private parties who make occasional firearm sales from personal collections or as a hobby—to conduct background checks on prospective firearm purchasers who are not licensed dealers themselves in order to ensure that the purchasers are not prohibited from acquiring firearms under federal or state law.
Between the enactment of the Brady Act and the launch of NICS, a set of interim provisions required background checks to be conducted through ""the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee,"" but the Supreme Court struck down those provisions as an unconstitutional usurpation of state executive prerogatives.
Congress has relied on the Commerce Clause as a constitutional basis for GCA provisions restricting the manufacture, import, sale, transfer, and possession of firearms, and the Supreme Court has reviewed a number of these regulations.
Without finding a substantial effect on interstate commerce, the Court further concluded that the law exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause because ""[t]he Act neither regulate[d] a commercial activity nor contain[ed] a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce."" Congress subsequently amended the provision to provide expressly that, for the possession of a firearm in a school zone to be a federal crime, the government must show that the firearm ""moved in or ...
Accordingly, it appears that in the event the government deprives a person of the right to keep and bear arms—the potential result of an overly stringent federal firearms measure—the touchtone of a reviewing court's constitutional analysis would be the Second Amendment rather than the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.
United States , for example, the Supreme Court struck down under the anti-commandeering doctrine certain interim provisions of the Brady Act. The relevant provisions required state and local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers.
As relevant here, though, Congress, as part of a deregulation measure, may expressly prohibit states from further regulating the same activity ""[t]o ensure that the States would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own.""  ""Red Flag"" Laws Somewhat related to mental health firearm restrictions are proposals for so-called ""red flag"" laws, which generally permit courts to issue temporary orders barring particular persons from possessing guns based on some showing of imminent danger or a risk of misuse."
121,"The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) notes that the Southwest border ""remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States."" Mexican TCOs control the flow of heroin across the border, the majority of which ""is through [privately owned vehicles] entering the United States at legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods."" Mexican criminal networks have not always featured so prominently (or broadly) in the U.S. heroin market.
Administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the program aims to reduce drug production and trafficking through four means: promoting coordination and information sharing between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement; bolstering intelligence sharing between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement; providing reliable intelligence to law enforcement agencies such that they may be better equipped to design effective enforcement operations and strategies; and promoting coordinated law enforcement strategies that rely upon available resources to reduce illegal drug supplies not only in a given area, but throughout the country.
In 2015, ONDCP launched the Heroin Response Strategy (HRS), ""a multi-HIDTA, cross-disciplinary approach that develops partnerships among public safety and public health agencies at the Federal, state and local levels to reduce drug overdose fatalities and disrupt trafficking in illicit opioids."" Within the HRS, a Public Health and Public Safety Network coordinates teams of drug intelligence officers and public health analysts in each state.
COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force Program Within DOJ, the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office's Anti-Heroin Task Force (AHTF) Program provides funding assistance to state law enforcement agencies to investigate illicit activities related to the trafficking or distribution of heroin or diverted prescription opioids.
In addition, as noted, officials have estimated heroin availability in the United States based, in part, on estimated production, known seizures, and the price and purity of select samples of wholesale and retail-level heroin, but these numbers collectively represent an imprecise picture of heroin trafficking.
Notably, the 2016 strategy identified the greatest drug threat to the United States as ""the continuing opioid epidemic, which began with the overprescribing of powerful long-acting, time-released opioid medications … [and] was further complicated by a sharp increase in the supply and subsequent use of high purity, low cost heroin produced in Mexico and Colombia and the trafficking of illicitly produced fentanyl."" It is unclear whether the Trump Administration will release a strategy or how prominently countering heroin trafficking as it contributes to the opioid epidemic may feature in that strategy."
122,"8(a) Program eligibility is generally limited to small businesses which are ""unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who are of good character and citizens of and residing in the United States"" and demonstrate ""potential for success."" However, small businesses owned by Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) are also eligible to participate in the 8(a) Program under somewhat different terms.
The Small Business Act also indicates ""that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy."" To help achieve these goals, the 8(a) Program's stated statutory purposes are to  (A) promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals so that such concerns can compete on an equal basis in the American economy; (B) promote the competitive viability of such concerns in the marketplace by providing such available contract, financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary; and (C) clarify and expand the program for the procurement by the United States of articles, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
In addition, the Small Business Administration (SBA) reviews and certifies eligible clients; assigns SBA personnel (Business Opportunity Specialists, BOSs) to monitor and measure each firm's progress through annual reviews, business planning collaboration, and systematic evaluations; helps to identify potential contract opportunities; and markets each firm's technical capabilities to federal agency procurement officials.
It concludes with an analysis of the following current 8(a) Program issues: The SBA's decision to address recent declines in the number of program participants by revising and streamlining the program's application process, an action which the SBA's Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG) reports ""may erode core safeguards that prevented questionable firms from entering the 8(a) Program."" Reported variation in 8(a) Program service delivery.
Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon laid foundations for the present 8(a) Program in the hope of providing such ""encouragement."" Johnson created the President's Test Cities Program (PTCP), which involved a small-scale use of the SBA's authority under Section 8(a) to award contracts to firms willing to locate in urban areas and hire unemployed individuals, largely African Americans, or sponsor minority-owned businesses by providing capital or management assistance.
The 1978 amendments also defined economically disadvantaged individuals , for purposes of the 8(a) Program, as ""those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged."" In 1989, the SBA established by regulation that personal net worth of less than $250,000 at the time of entry into the program ($750,000 for continuing eligibility) constitutes economic disadvantage.
General Requirements Program Eligibility As mentioned previously, 8(a) Program eligibility is limited to ""small business[es] which [are] unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who are of good character and citizens of and residing in the United States, and which demonstrates potential for success."" Each of these terms is defined by the Small Business Act; SBA regulations; and judicial and administrative decisions.
Set-Asides and Sole-Source Awards Under Section 8(a) Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act authorizes agencies to award contracts for goods or services, or to perform construction work, to the SBA for subcontracting to 8(a) firms.
Sole-source awards of contracts valued at $4 million ($7 million or more for manufacturing contracts) may be made only when (1) there is not a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible 8(a) firms will submit offers at a fair market price or (2) the SBA accepts the requirement on behalf of an 8(a) firm owned by an Indian tribe, an ANC or, in the case of Department of Defense contracts, an NHO.
Other Requirements Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes are governed by the same regulations as other 8(a) firms in which certain of the ""other requirements"" are involved, including (1) inability to protest an 8(a) firm's eligibility for an award; (2) maximum of nine years in the program (for individual firms); and (3) limits on subcontracting.
As will be discussed, GAO and others have argued that this overlapping organizational structure may ""create programmatic challenges."" The Application Process Prior to applying for certification, firms must complete all requirements for contracting with the federal government (e.g., get a free D-U-N-S number—a unique nine-digit identification number of each physical business location from Dun and Bradstreet; obtain a free tax identification number or employer identification number from the Internal Revenue Service; create a profile in the federal System for Award Management, and get a free SBA general login system user ID).
If the firm participates in the 8(a) Mentor-Protégé Program (see below) it must provide ""a narrative report detailing the contracts it has had with its mentor and benefits it has received from the mentor/protégé relationship."" In addition, the firm must provide a report for each 8(a) contract performed during the year ""explaining how the performance of work requirements are being met for the contract, including any 8(a) contracts performed as a joint venture."" In 2010, GAO reported that the district staff's ""dual role of advocacy for and monitoring of the firms may have contributed in part to the retention of ineligible firms."" In response, in 2012, the SBA shifted responsibility for processing the continued eligibility portion of the required annual review from BOSs located in the SBA district offices to its Washington, DC, office.
Only SBA approved firms may serve as mentors, and each mentor must (1) demonstrate that it ""is capable of carrying out its responsibilities to assist the protégé firm under the proposed mentor-protégé agreement""; (2) possess good character; (3) not be debarred or suspended from government contracting; and (4) be able to ""impart value to a protégé firm due to lessons learned and practical experienced gained because of the [8(a) program], or through its knowledge of general business operations and government contracting."" Protégés, in turn, are required to be small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals that are in good standing in the 8(a) Program."

Alternative fuels programs can be generally classified into six categories: expanding domestic ethanol production; establishing other alternative fuels; encouraging the purchase of nonpetroleum vehicles; reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; supporting U.S. vehicle manufacturing; and funding U.S. highways."
127,"Successive U.S. Administrations have viewed U.S. leadership of NATO as a cornerstone of U.S. national security strategy, bringing benefits ranging from peace and stability in Europe to the political and military support of 28 allies, including many of the world's most advanced militaries.
President Trump's supporters, including some Members of Congress, also argue that Trump's forceful statements have succeeded in securing defense spending increases across the alliance that were not forthcoming under his predecessors.
At the same time, Congress continues to assess NATO's utility and value to the United States and some Members are concerned about several key challenges that continue to face the alliance, including burdensharing, managing relations with Russia, and divergent threat perceptions within the alliance.
Historical Context: NATO's Evolution4 Broadly speaking, NATO has evolved through four phases since its inception in 1949:  t he Cold War era between 1949 and 1991; t he post-Cold War transformation of the 1990s , marked by the start of NATO enlargement to former Warsaw Pact countries and debates over ""out-of-area"" military operations prompted by wars in the Western Balkans; t he post-September 11, 2001 , focus on crisis management and stabilizing Afghanistan; and s ince 2014, a renewed focus on deterring Russia and heightened concern about threats emanating from the Middle East and North Africa.
The United States led a renewed push for the allies to increase defense spending and develop military capabilities to better respond to the new security environment, including ""out-of-area"" stabilization and counter-insurgency operations.
In an effort to address these concerns, in 2014, the allies adopted the aforementioned guideline calling for 20% of member states' national defense budgets to be allocated to the procurement of new equipment and related research and development, considered to be a key indicator of the pace of military modernization.
Since the end of the Cold War, NATO allies and partner countries have contributed to a range of NATO-led military operations across the globe, including in the Western Balkans, Afghanistan, the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.
Despite the criticisms of European defense spending trends, non-U.S. allies still possess significant military capabilities, which they have deployed in support of U.S. security objectives."
128,"The combined total of $45.9 billion would have been about $3.2 billion below the President's FY2019 request, with the largest differences in the funding for the General Services Administration (GSA) and in language relating to government-wide transfers that was requested by the President but not included in the legislation (Section 737).
Although funding for many financial regulatory agencies may not be provided by the FSGG bill, legislative provisions affecting financial regulation in general and some of these agencies specifically have often been included in FSGG bills."
129,"IEA member countries, including the United States, have committed to maintaining stocks of crude oil and petroleum products equivalent to 90 days of their previous year's net imports; developing programs for demand restraint in the event of emergencies; and agreeing to participate in an allocation of oil deliveries program to balance shortages among IEA member nations.
For example, in 2011, the United States participated in a coordinated IEA oil stock drawdown in response to the withdrawal of Libyan oil exports from the market as a result of political and military turmoil in that country.
Considered in another way, the net import level of 3.768 mmb/d, when multiplied by 90 days required stocks, implies a need for the United States to hold about 340 million barrels in the SPR.
Leasing of excess SPR capacity to foreign governments for oil reserve storage is less likely to be associated with the short-term problems identified with commercial leasing."

132,"Introduction The 116 th Congress, in both its legislative and oversight capacities, faces numerous trade policy issues related to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations and the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Key issues for Congress in regard to the consideration of the proposed USMCA include the constitutional authority of Congress over international trade, its role in revising, approving, or withdrawing from the agreement, U.S. negotiating objectives and the extent to which the proposed agreement makes progress in meeting them as required under TPA.
Congress may also consider the agreement's impact on U.S. industries, the U.S. economy, and broader U.S. trade relations with Canada and Mexico, two of the United States' largest trading partners.
After numerous rounds of negotiations, on August 31, 2018, after the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary U.S.-Mexico agreement, President Trump notified Congress of his intention to ""enter into a trade agreement with Mexico – and with Canada if it is willing."" On September 30, 2018, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer announced that the three countries had reached an agreement on a USMCA trade deal that would revise, modernize, and replace NAFTA upon ratification.
Canada, in its negotiating objectives, pledged to make NAFTA more ""progressive"" by strengthening labor and environmental provisions, adding a new chapter on indigenous rights, reforming the investor-state dispute settlement process, and protecting Canada's supply-management system for dairy and poultry, among other objectives.
Mexico's set of negotiating objectives prioritized free trade of goods and services, and included provisions to update NAFTA, such as working toward ""inclusive and responsible"" trade by incorporating cooperation mechanisms in areas related to labor standards, anticorruption, and the environment, as well as strengthening energy security by enhancing NAFTA's chapter on energy.
U.S. objectives appeared to seek to ""rebalance the benefits"" of the agreement, echoing President Trump's statements that NAFTA has been a ""disaster"" and the ""worst agreement ever negotiated."" Some U.S. negotiating positions could be seen to have the explicit or implicit goal of promoting U.S. economic sovereignty and/or rolling back previous liberalization commitments in specific areas, such as reviewing and potentially sunsetting the agreement every five years, questioning the validity of binational dispute settlement, enhancing government procurement restrictions, and increasing U.S. and North American content in the auto rules of origin.
Many economists and business representatives generally look to maintain and strengthen the trade and investment relationship with Canada and Mexico under NAFTA or the proposed USMCA, and to further improve overall relations and economic integration within the region.
It is significant because it was the first FTA among two wealthy countries and a lower-income country and because it established trade liberalization commitments that led the way in setting new rules for future trade agreements on issues important to the United States.
These include provisions on intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, services trade, agriculture, dispute settlement procedures, investment, labor, and the environment.
At the time that NAFTA was implemented, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) was already in effect and U.S. tariffs on most Mexican goods were low, while Mexico had the highest level of trade barriers among the three countries.
Key NAFTA Provisions Some key NAFTA provisions include tariff and nontariff trade liberalization, rules of origin, commitments on services trade and foreign investment, IPR protection, government procurement rules, and dispute resolution.
Because NAFTA is 25 years old, the proposed USMCA could be viewed as an opportunity to include obligations not currently covered in the original text, such as digital trade or more enforceable labor and environmental provisions.
The proposed USMCA would tighten auto rules of origin by including new motor vehicle rules of origin and procedures, including product-specific rules, and requiring 75% North American content; for the first time in a trade agreement, wage requirements stipulating 40%-45% of North American auto content be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour; a requirement that 70% of a vehicle's steel and aluminum must originate in North America; and a provision aiming to streamline the enforcement of manufacturers' rules of origin certification requirements.
After the announcement of the proposed USMCA, the UAW issued a statement that it would need time to evaluate the details of the agreement before determining whether the ""agreement will protect our UAW jobs and the living standards of all Americans."" Agriculture65 NAFTA's agriculture provisions include tariff and quota elimination, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, rules of origin, and grade and quality standards.
Core provisions promote transparency in the tendering process through online tender information and descriptions; provide online application and documentation processes without cost to the applicant; provide for publication of post-award explanations of procurement decisions; exclude government procurement from the financial services chapter; exclude textile and apparel procured by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the ""Kissell Amendment;"" allow Mexico to set aside annual procurement contracts of $2.328 billion, annually adjusted for inflation, to Mexican suppliers; allow for coverage of build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts (As Mexico has taken an exception to this provision, the United States will extend this coverage to Mexico when Mexico reciprocates.) The exclusion of Canada is a break from previous government procurement chapters in U.S. FTAs. As noted above, procurement opportunities in each country for U.S. and Canadian firms will continue to be covered by the GPA, which was revised and updated in 2014.
Government Right to Regulate  Unlike NAFTA, the proposed USMCA contains a provision stating that, except in rare circumstances, nondiscriminatory regulatory action by a party to protect legitimate public welfare objectives (e.g., in public health, safety, and the environment) do not constitute indirect expropriation.
Under the proposed USMCA, ISDS is continued in three circumstances:  Legacy claims from existing investments are eligible for arbitration under NAFTA ISDS provisions for three years from the date of NAFTA termination; Direct expropriation claims, including claims of violation of national treatment, would continue to be eligible for arbitration for United States and Mexican investors, provided that they exhaust domestic remedies first.
Services The United States has a highly competitive services sector and has made services trade liberalization a priority in its negotiations of FTAs, including NAFTA and the proposed USMCA.
Key provisions of the services chapter in NAFTA and the proposed USMCA include the following:  nondiscriminatory treatment of services from partner-country providers in like circumstances, including national treatment and MFN treatment; no limitations on the number of service suppliers, the total value or volume of services provided, the number of persons employed, or the types of legal entities or joint ventures that a foreign service supplier may employ; prohibition on locality requirements that a service provider maintain a commercial presence in the country of the buyer; support of mutual recognition of professional qualifications for certification of service providers; transparency in the development and application of government regulations; and allowance for payments and transfers of capital flows ""freely and without delay"" that relate to the provision of services, with permissible restrictions in some cases for bankruptcy and criminal offences.
Other new USMCA financial services provisions would exclude government procurement from financial services disciplines; modify investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) through a bilateral annex on Mexico-United States Investment Disputes in Financial Services; allow a financial institution from one party with a presence in a second party to have access to the latter's payment and clearance system; and protect source code and algorithms and a prohibition on forced technology transfer in the digital trade section.
Key provisions of the proposed USMCA digital trade chapter ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of digital products; prohibit cross-border data flows restrictions and data localization requirements; prohibit requirements for source code or algorithm disclosure or transfer as a condition for market access, with exceptions; prohibit customs duties or other charges for electronically transmitted products; require parties to have online consumer protection and anti-spam laws, and a legal framework on privacy; promote cooperation on cybersecurity, and risk-based strategies and consensus-based standards over prescriptive regulation in combating cybersecurity risks and events; prohibit imposition of liability for harms against Internet services providers or users related to information stored, processed, transmitted, distributed, or made available by the service, with the exclusion of ISP liability for intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement; and promote publication of open government data in machine readable format for public usage.
In FTA negotiations, the United States has sought to limit GI protections that can improperly constrain U.S. agricultural market access in other countries by protecting terms viewed as ""common."" This goal may be complicated by the recent Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union, which provides additional protections for GIs in Canada.
The proposed USMCA protects GIs for food products that Canada and Mexico have already accepted as a consequence of trade agreements with the European Union; provides transparency and notification requirements, and objection procedures, for new GIs; and sets forth guidelines to determine whether a term is customary in the common language.
The dispute settlement system in NAFTA Chapter 19 originated during the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) negotiations that culminated in 1988, and it was retained under NAFTA.
While neither Canada nor Mexico have been accused of currency manipulation in the past, the inclusion of a currency manipulation chapter could serve as a precedent for including such provisions in future FTAs. Over the past decade, some Members of Congress and policy experts have been concerned that foreign countries may use exchange rate policies to gain an unfair trade advantage against the United States, or are ""manipulating"" their currencies.
Key issues Congress may examine include modernized provisions of the agreement, the role of the Congress and the President in the NAFTA renegotiation and approval process, whether the agreement meets TPA objectives, the possible economic impact, especially in the auto industry, and how the agreement may impact U.S. relations with Canada and Mexico, two of the United States' largest trading partners.
The full effects of the proposed USMCA on North American trade relations are not be expected to be significant because nearly all U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico that meets rules of origin requirements is now conducted duty and barrier free under NAFTA."
133,"According to an informal agreement among their member countries, the U.S. nominee is chosen as the World Bank president and a European candidate (typically French or German) is appointed as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The IBRD provides middle-income developing countries with loans at near-market rates using funds raised by the World Bank on international capital markets.
As the largest contributor, the United States holds a single seat on the 25-member Board of Executive Directors and carries 16.32% of the total votes in Bank decisionmaking, which provides veto power on decisions requiring an 85% majority vote.
In a statement at the 2017 IMF and World Bank spring meetings, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that, ""the relationship between the World Bank and more creditworthy countries [such as China] should mature over time, with the absolute level of borrowing declining as countries become better able to finance their own development objectives."" Leadership Selection at the World Bank Selecting the leadership at the two major international financial institutions—the IMF and the World Bank—is guided by a tradition that the World Bank president is an American and that the IMF managing director is a European."
134,"Introduction Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States ""by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate."" The method by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, referred to broadly as the confirmation process, serves several purposes.
First, largely through committee investigations and hearings, the confirmation process allows the Senate to examine the qualifications of nominees and any potential conflicts of interest.
Except by unanimous consent, the Senate cannot vote on nominations the day they are received, and most are referred immediately to committees.
This section of the Calendar is titled ""Privileged Nominations."" After the chair of the committee with jurisdiction over a nomination has notified the executive clerk that biographical and financial information on the nominee has been received, this is indicated in the Calendar.
Formally the presiding officer, but administratively the executive clerk's office, refers the nominations to committees according to the Senate's rules and precedents.
In addition, at the start of each Congress, the Senate adopts a standing order, by unanimous consent, that allows the Senate to receive nominations from the President and for them to be referred to committees even on days when the Senate does not meet in executive session.
For example, the majority leader may move or ask unanimous consent to ""immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination on the Executive Calendar....
Cloture may be moved only on a question that is pending before the Senate; therefore, absent unanimous consent, the Senate must be in executive session and considering the nomination when the motion is filed.
Instead, Senators typically debated the nomination for some time post-cloture, but also usually entered into unanimous consent agreements that affected when the vote would occur."
135,"DOI defines its mission as to protect and manage the nation's natural resources and cultural heritage for the benefit of the American people; to provide scientific and scholarly information about those resources and natural hazards; and to exercise the country's trust responsibilities and special commitments to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and island territories under U.S. administration.
Initially conceived as a ""home department"" in 1849 to oversee a broad array of internal affairs, DOI has evolved to become the nation's principal land management agency, charged with administering the use of more than 480 million acres of public lands, 700 million acres of subsurface minerals, and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf (OCS).
DOI Today: Leadership, Structure, and Functions Overview DOI is a Cabinet-level department that employs approximately 65,000 full-time employees across nine technical bureaus and various administrative and programmatic offices.
In addition to its headquarters in Washington, DC, DOI has staff in roughly 2,400 locations across the United States, including both regional offices and field centers.
Like other Cabinet-level agencies, DOI has an inspector general, who administers the office responsible for providing oversight to DOI's programs, operations, and management.
The bureau also is responsible for protecting and administering assets on tribal lands, including the management of 55 million surface acres and 57 million acres of subsurface mineral estates held in trust by the United States.
Similar to other DOI agencies, the BIA has a three-tiered organizational structure, with leadership and senior executives operating from headquarters in Washington, DC, and 12 regional offices that oversee 53 field offices (referred to as agencies by the BIA); these agencies deliver program services directly to tribal communities.
With the Organic Act, Congress created the National Park Service (NPS) and established the agency's dual mandate—to protect the country's natural and cultural resources while providing for their public use and enjoyment.
Similar to most DOI agencies, FWS has a three-tiered organizational structure comprised of national, regional, and local field offices across the United States."
136,"Should such a post be established, potential candidates include the deputy prime minister for cabinet affairs, Fahd bin Mahmud Al Said (who Omanis already widely refer to as ""Prime Minister""); the secretary general of the Foreign Ministry, Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi; Salim bin Nasir al-Ismaily, a businessman and economic adviser to the Sultan who reportedly brokered 2013 U.S.-Iran meetings; and Royal Office head General Sultan bin Mohammad al-Naamani.
They are Minister of Heritage and Culture Sayyid Haythim bin Tariq Al Said, whom some assess indecisive; Asad bin Tariq Al Said, a former military officer who has the title ""Representative of the Sultan"" and was appointed deputy prime minister for international relations and cooperation affairs in early 2017; and Shihab bin Tariq Al Said, the former commander of Oman's Navy.
Representative Institutions, Election History, and Unrest Many Omanis, U.S. officials, and international observers credit Sultan Qaboos for establishing consultative institutions and electoral processes before there was evident public pressure to do so.
By mid-2012, the government had calmed the unrest through a combination of reforms and punishments, including expanding the powers of the Oman Council; appointing several members of the Consultative Council as ministers; giving the office of the public prosecutor autonomy and consumers additional protections; naming an additional woman minister; ordering that additional public sector jobs be created; increasing the minimum wage; making grants to unemployed job seekers; and arresting journalists, bloggers, and other activists for ""defaming the Sultan,"" ""illegal gathering,"" or violating the country's cyber laws.
State Department funds (Middle East Partnership Initiative, Near East Regional Democracy account, and other accounts) have been used in past fiscal years to promote Omani civil society, judicial reform, election management, media independence, and women's empowerment.
In July 2017, during a visit by Oman's de-facto Foreign Minister Yusuf Alawi to Tehran, Iran and Oman announced plans to strengthen their ties—a statement interpreted as an Omani signal of disagreement with the Saudi-led move to isolate Qatar.
Iran's Foreign Minister visited Oman and met with Sultan Qaboos in October 2017 to discuss regional issues.
In the course of his January 2019 regional trip, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo met with Sultan Qaboos to discuss regional issues, and he praised Oman for enforcing the sanctions that the Trump Administration reimposed on Iran.
As the only GCC state that has not joined the Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting to restore the Hadi government and with its ties to Iran, Oman has become a mediator of the Yemen conflict.
In August 2015, Oman hosted Syria's foreign minister for talks on possible political solutions to the Syria conflict, and in October 2015, Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Alawi visited Damascus to convey a U.S. message to Asad.
In an April 2008 meeting in Qatar, de-facto Foreign Minister Alawi informed his Israeli counterpart (visiting Doha for a conference) that the Israeli trade office in Oman would remain closed until agreement was reached on a Palestinian state.
Sultan Qaboos has always supported close defense cooperation with the United States.
Days after the signing, the United States used Oman's Masirah Island air base to launch the failed attempt to rescue the U.S. Embassy hostages in Iran, although Omani officials assert that they were not informed of that operation in advance.
On March 24, 2019, Oman and the United States signed a ""Strategic Framework Agreement"" that expands the U.S.-Oman facilities access agreements by allowing U.S. forces to use the ports of Al Duqm (see above) and Salalah.
Omani leaders express willingness to join a U.S.-backed ""Middle East Strategic Alliance"" of the GCC states and Jordan and Egypt, envisioned as countering Iran.
The intra-GCC rift, as well as Yemen, Iran, and other issues, was discussed during the January 2019 visit to Oman of Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, according to a State Department announcement."
137,"Introduction The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program provides long-term, low-interest loans and other types of credit assistance for the construction of surface transportation projects.
Direct funding for the TIFIA program to make loans is authorized at $300 million for each of FY2019 and FY2020, but state departments of transportation can also use federal-aid highway grant money, both formula and discretionary, to subsidize much larger loans.
The TIFIA program has been one of the main ways in which the federal government has encouraged the development of public-private partnerships (P3s) and private financing in surface transportation often backed by new, but sometimes uncertain, revenue sources such as highway tolls, other types of user charges, and incremental real estate taxes.
These limits include the number of projects that can take advantage of credit assistance, the difficulties of developing revenue mechanisms to service loans, the typical need for grant funding to make up a portion of the capital, and the difficulties of attracting private investment to risky projects, particularly those for which demand is uncertain or hard to predict.
Despite the higher limit established in law, DOT has generally limited loans and loan guarantees to no more than 33% of project costs, so as ""to ensure that the DOT shares the credit risk with other participants."" Projects eligible for TIFIA assistance include highways and bridges, public transportation, transit-oriented development, intercity passenger bus and rail, intermodal connectors, intermodal freight facilities, and the capitalization of a rural projects fund.
As an example, if administrative costs are ignored, for every $100 of budget authority at a subsidy rate of 10%, the federal government can loan out $1,000 because it expects to eventually receive back $900 calculated in today's dollars.
However, the FAST Act also allows states to use funds from three other highway programs to pay for the subsidy and administrative costs of credit assistance: the discretionary Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects Program, known as INFRA grants; the formula National Highway Performance Program; and the formula Surface Transportation Block Grant Program."
138,"Overview The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress is the most recent effort of the House of Representatives to examine its internal procedures and operations through the use of a specialized committee, commission, or party conference or caucus group.
The stated purpose of the select committee is ""to investigate, study, make findings, hold public hearings, and develop recommendations on modernizing Congress."" The select committee's authorization ends on February 1, 2020, and any activities beyond that date would require additional authorization."
139,"Overview U.S. relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia have become increasingly strained in recent years in light of Prime Minister Hun Sen's suppression of the political opposition and his growing embrace of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
During the previous decade, U.S. engagement with the Kingdom slowly strengthened as Western countries continued to pressure Hun Sen to abide by democratic norms and institutions and as the U.S. government attempted to prevent Cambodia from falling too heavily under China's influence.
The Trump Administration stated that the election ""failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people"" and represented ""the most significant setback yet to the democratic system enshrined in Cambodia's constitution.…""  Between 1975 and 1991, Cambodia endured the four-year reign of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (also known as the Khmer Rouge), during which an estimated 2 million Cambodians died; an invasion and occupation by Vietnam; and civil war.
A U.S. Embassy spokesperson stated, ""We continue to call on the government of Cambodia to drop all charges against Mr. Sokha, remove restrictions on the political rights of him and other opposition leaders, and engage opposition leaders in an urgent dialogue aimed at building genuine national reconciliation."" Crackdown on Government Critics and Civil Society Beginning in 2015 with new government restrictions on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and during the lead-up to the 2018 national elections, the Cambodian government placed increasing restrictions on political and social activism, civil society, free speech, and foreign-funded democracy programs.
In September 2018, Prime Minister Hun Sen, in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, stated, ""We are heartedly regretful to highlight the fact that human rights nowadays have become 'a mission to impose civilization' for some powerful nations or, perhaps, as their operating standards as the pretext for interference under the name of political right protection."" U.S.-Cambodia Cooperation U.S.-Cambodian relations expanded after 2007, when political and human rights conditions in the Kingdom improved and the U.S. government lifted some restrictions on U.S. assistance."
140,"Section 103H(g) permitted lawful disclosures to the IGIC, but lacked the specificity of later whistleblower protection legislation and directives:  (3) The Inspector General [of the Intelligence Community] is authorized to receive and investigate, pursuant to subsection (h), complaints or information from any person concerning the existence of an activity within the authorities and responsibilities of the Director of National Intelligence constituting a violation of laws, rules, or regulations, or mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety.
PPD-19 specifically protects some employees in the IC (it specifically excludes members of the Armed Forces) with access to classified information, from personnel actions taken in reprisal for making a lawful disclosure.
PPD-19 defines a protected disclosure in part as follows: a disclosure of information by the employee to a supervisor in the employee's direct chain of command up to and including the head of the employing agency, to the Inspector General of the employing agency or Intelligence Community Element, to the Director of National Intelligence, to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, or to an employee designated by any of the above officials for the purpose of receiving such disclosures, that the employee reasonably believes evidences (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety."
141,"the individual who considers himself injured[] has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy."" Naturally, Congress and its Members have an interest in litigating in federal court, for example, to vindicate their institutional priorities, to argue that the Executive is violating their legislative prerogatives, or to advance their legislative policy interests.
Americans United for Separation of Church and State , the Supreme Court held that a public interest organization lacked standing to challenge the transfer of federal land to a religiously affiliated school, as the only injuries identified by the plaintiffs were the ""psychological consequence[s] presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees."" A claim based only on this sort of psychological discomfort will generally not support an injury-in-fact.
He argued that so-called ""intra-parliamentary disputes"" should be left to parliaments, and that the injuries suffered here ""pertain[ed] to legislators not as individuals but as political representatives executing the legislative process."" If these interests were recognized, Frankfurter feared that the courts would end up ""sit[ting] in judgment on the manifold disputes engendered by procedures for voting in legislative assemblies."" Despite these arguments, Justice Frankfurter's view did not control, and Coleman is recognized as the first case in which the Supreme Court acknowledged that legislators' interest in their votes may constitute an injury that could be vindicated in federal court.
The Court found that the key difference between the Arizona legislature and the plaintiffs in Raines was that the former was ""an institutional plaintiff asserting an institutional injury [that had] commenced this action after authorizing votes in both of its chambers."" The problem with the individual Members asserting institutional injury in Raines , as the Arizona State Legislature Court saw it, was that the injury was ""widely dispersed,"" and no plaintiff in the 1997 case could ""tenably claim a personal stake in the suit."" In contrast with Raines , the Court concluded, Arizona State Legislature was closer to the Coleman facts, in that the Commission's authority ""completely nullif[ied]"" any vote by the legislature purporting to adopt a redistricting plan—and that injury was adequately particularized to the plaintiff that was bringing the suit.
Importantly, however, the Court stated in a footnote that the standing inquiry might have been different had the suit involved Congress mounting a legal challenge to the President, which would have raised ""separation-of-powers concerns absent here."" A few key principles can be drawn from this line of Supreme Court cases.
equally."" The Arizona State Legislature court, interpreting Raines , explained that individual legislators generally cannot assert institutional injuries: ""[h]aving failed to prevail in their own Houses, the suitors [in Raines ] could not repair to the Judiciary to complain."" However, Raines also determined that there was an exception to this general rule based on the Court's holding in Coleman v.
The Members argued that their injury was more severe than the injury at stake in Raines because the President's action had ""denied Members of Congress any opportunity to vote for or against the AHRI."" The D.C. Circuit disagreed, concluding instead that the injury asserted by the plaintiffs in Chenoweth was fundamentally the same as that asserted in Raines —that their injury was an ""alter[ation] [in] the constitutional balance of powers between the Legislative and Executive Branches."" Further, the court observed that here, as in Raines , it was ""uncontested that the Congress could terminate the AHRI were a sufficient number in each House so inclined,"" meaning that, as in Raines , Congress had a legislative remedy.
The court concluded that the availability of these alternate remedies, combined with the fact that Congress as a whole had not authorized these individual Members to represent its interests in federal litigation, demonstrated that the plaintiffs could not assert the institutional injury alleged.
Second, in response to the argument that the use of these procedures had ""nullified"" the plaintiffs' votes in the legislature, the court, analyzing Raines and Coleman , concluded that ""[f]or legislators to have standing as legislators, then, they must possess votes sufficient to have either defeated or approved the measure at issue."" As this court read Coleman , standing required that the lawsuit be joined by sufficient members of their respective houses to defeat the legislation in order to show that actual nullification occurred.
The court determined that the plaintiffs had not shown that their vote had been nullified within the meaning of Coleman —plaintiffs had alleged only that they ""ha[d] been required to vote and legislate without full access to information."" The plaintiffs, however, argued that their injury was personal, not institutional, because they had a ""distinct legal entitlement not shared by all Members of Congress."" The court disagreed.
Although the Arizona State Legislature Court deemed it important that the legislative plaintiffs commenced the lawsuit after ""authorizing votes in both of its chambers,"" that does not mean that a congressional plaintiff must always obtain the imprimatur of both the Senate and the House of Representatives in order to bring suit.
The court therefore ultimately concluded ""that the Committee ha[d] standing to enforce its duly issued subpoena through a civil suit."" According to the court, the fact that the committee had ""been expressly authorized by House Resolution to proceed on behalf of the House of Representatives as an institution "" distinguished Miers from cases like Raines in which individual legislators had invalidly attempted to assert injuries to their respective institutions as a whole rather than to themselves personally.
However, the district court then ruled that the House lacked standing to pursue its parallel challenges to the Executive's alleged violation of the statutory scheme, reasoning that Article III does not create ""general legislative standing"" by which the branches of Congress may sue the Executive for any alleged violation of statutes or the Constitution by the Executive.
The Supreme Court has periodically considered how the adversity and standing doctrines apply in the congressional intervention context and has ultimately concluded that cases in which the executive branch declines to defend a federal statute and Congress steps in to defend the law may potentially be justiciable.
The court, noting that ""the sole purpose of the House's proposed amicus brief [was] to urge a ground for dismissing [the] plaintiff's complaint that was not raised by the [Department of Justice] in its motion to dismiss,"" reasoned that allowing the House to participate as an amicus would ""improperly intrud[e] on the DOJ's 'exclusive and plenary' authority to litigate the case on the United States' behalf.""  Considerations for Congress As discussed, courts have identified several considerations that may be relevant when assessing whether a legislative entity has suffered a justiciable injury-in-fact allowing it to seek judicial relief from a federal court, including the presence of congressional authorization; the absence of other legislative or nonlegislative remedies; allegations of vote nullification; historical practice; availability of alternative plaintiffs to bring a judicial challenge; and whether the lawsuit is an attempt to assert an interest other than the generalized interest in the proper application and implementation of the law."
142,"The Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2019, as part of an overall budget that the Office of Management and Budget estimated to be $74.88 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not annually appropriated or does not score against discretionary budget limits).
The Trump Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and is not reflected in the above totals.
The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the BCA, and in the budget request for the Department of Defense, $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding (OCO), to be transferred to the Coast Guard.
Division A, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.69 billion (3.5%) more than had been provided for FY2018, and $2.04 billion more than had been requested by the Administration in February 2018.
Following the methodology used by the appropriations committees, totals of ""appropriations"" do not include resources provided by transfer or under adjustments to discretionary spending limits (i.e., for emergency requirements, overseas contingency operations for the Coast Guard or the cost of major disasters under the Stafford Act for the Federal Emergency Management Agency).
Amounts covered by adjustments are included with discretionary appropriations in a separate total for ""discretionary funding."" A subtotal for each component of total estimated budgetary resources that would be available under the legislation and from other sources (such as fees, mandatory spending, and trust funds) for the given fiscal year is also provided at the end of each component section.
The total budgetary resources projected for components funded in this title were $47.82 billion, $704 million (1.5%) more than was formally requested by the Administration, and $1.75 billion (3.8%) more than was provided in FY2018, setting aside the FY2018 supplemental funding.
The Senate committee-reported bill included within these totals the requested disaster relief funding of $6.65 billion, and offset $228 million in its Federal Assistance appropriation from unobligated DRF balances.
House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $1.64 billion in net discretionary funding for components included in this title, as part of a projected total budget of $6.21 billion."
143,"This report begins with background information on the NFS and BLM's public lands and an overview of two laws: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA).
Congress directed that management of the national forests shall be to protect watersheds and forests and provide a ""continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of the United States"" and authorized the sale of ""dead, matured, or large growth of trees."" Congress added recreation, livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, and protection of wildlife and fish habitat as official uses of the national forests, in addition to watershed protection and timber production, in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (MUSY).
Any proposed on-the-ground activities or projects must be consistent with those plans and must be planned, evaluated, and implemented using BLM's procedures for ensuring compliance with the laws that apply broadly to any federal agency action (e.g., NEPA, ESA, NHPA).
For example, within the framework of determining the resources affected and level of effects of a given proposal, the agency's NEPA process would identify project impacts that may trigger additional environmental review and consultation requirements under ESA and NHPA, among other laws.
Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) HFRA, among other purposes, was intended to expedite the planning and review process for hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands.
Thus, these projects also are subject to HFRA's pre-decisional objections process; must be developed through a collaborative process with state, local, and tribal government collaboration and participation of interested persons; consider the best available science; and maximize the retention of old-growth and large trees, as appropriate for the forest type and to the extent it would promote insect and disease resiliency.
2014 Farm Bill Insect and Disease NEPA Categorical Exclusion (CE) The 2014 farm bill also added a new Section 603 to HFRA, which specified in statute that certain projects intended to reduce the risk or extent of insect or disease infestations within I&D areas would be considered actions categorically excluded from the requirements of NEPA (commonly referred to as the F arm B ill CE ).
Thus, projects to build fuel or fire breaks may be planned and implemented using the procedures authorized under HFRA, such as requiring analysis of a specific number of alternatives depending on the proposed action's location.
In the Wildfire Resilience CE, Congress explicitly directed FS to apply its procedures for evaluating if the resource conditions identified as extraordinary circumstances are present on the project site, and if the presence of those extraordinary circumstances may thus preclude the use of the CE and require further analysis of potential impacts through an EA or EIS.
Sage Grouse/Mule Deer CE Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, for NFS lands, and the Secretary of the Interior, for BLM lands, to establish a CE for specified projects to protect, restore, or improve greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat within one year of enactment.
The law specifies that the listing of a species as threatened or endangered or the designation of critical habitat pursuant to the ESA does not require the Secretary of Agriculture (for NFS lands) or the Secretary of the Interior (for the O&C and CBWR lands) to engage in Section 7 consultation to update or revise a forest plan, unless the plan is older than 15 years and 5 years has passed since either the date of enactment or the listing of the species, whichever is later.
Those in favor of the enacted changes contend that not requiring Section 7 consultations for existing land management plans due to a species listing or designation of critical habitat will provide more flexibility in implementing plans, allow for consistency in keeping the plans in place, and enable plan and project implementation to proceed with fewer delays.
This included reauthorizing the use of procedures intended to expedite the priority projects in NFS areas designated as I&D areas and expanding the definition of an authorized fuel reduction project, as discussed previously in the "" Planning and Project Implementation Requirements "" section.
Section 103 of the FY2018 omnibus requires the applicable Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to ""promptly"" submit a request to Congress for supplemental appropriations if the amount provided for wildfire suppression operations for a fiscal year is estimated to be exhausted within 30 days.
Specifically, Section 210 directs FS to consult with federal and state partners, and relevant colleges and universities to develop, within two years, web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for use at the community level to inform risk management decisions for at-risk communities adjacent to NFS lands or affected by wildland fire.
Summary of Changes and Discussion The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA and authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a specific Water Source Protection program on NFS land (§8404).
Forest Service Communication Uses Fee Schedules and Processes Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process to issue special use authorizations for communications uses on NFS lands within one year of enactment, defined relevant terms, and identified specific requirements for the process.
The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution ROWs and identified specific requirements for those processes.
Many of the provisions enacted by the 115 th Congress aim to improve agency efficiencies by expanding the applicability of procedures intended to expedite the planning and review process for projects, such as hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects."
144,"Similarly, the FY2019 appropriations act did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs; however, the enacted 2018 farm bill (Agriculture Improvement Act, P.L. 115-334 ) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs.
The FY2019 appropriations act included a decrease from FY2018 levels for discretionary conservation programs and redirected funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center (see Table 1 and Figure 1 ).
The enacted level is more than the Administration's request and directs a transfer of funds from other accounts into the Business Center, including mandatory conservation programs and farm loan accounts.
As such, NRCS was initially able to claim as excepted 100% of its 9,342 staff using mandatory conservation program funding authorized through the farm bill (and therefore not affected by the lapse in discretionary appropriations), and discretionary carryover funding from prior fiscal years."
145,"According to one contemporary account, a broad initial construction of the rule by the House resulted in ""putting a great mass of general legislation upon the appropriation bills.""  The rule was retained in this form until 1880 (46 th Congress), when it was modified to define retrenchments as the reduction of ""the number and salary of officers of the United States, the reduction of compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States, or the reduction of the amounts of money covered by the bill."" That form of the rule remained a part of House rules until the 49 th Congress eliminated it in 1885.
As a consequence, even with the additional scope provided by the language of the separate order, it would likely not be in order to include broad legislative provisions in, or amendments to, a specific appropriation bill that would apply to the salary or number of federal employees funded through appropriations in other measures."
146,"This report focuses on one pillar of that approach—the Federal Reserve's (Fed's) enhanced (heightened) prudential regulation for large banks and nonbank financial firms designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).
The Dodd-Frank Act automatically subjected all bank holding companies and foreign banks with more than $50 billion in assets to enhanced prudential regulation (EPR).
In addition, Basel III (a nonbinding international agreement that U.S. banking regulators implemented through rulemaking after the financial crisis) included several capital requirements that only apply to large banks.
Banks that have been designated as Global-Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) by the Financial Stability Board (an international, intergovernmental forum) or have more than $250 billion in assets automatically remain subject to all EPR requirements, as modified.
Although THCs are also regulated by the Fed, the EPR statute does not mention THCs. To date, enhanced prudential regulatory requirements have not been applied to large thrift (savings and loan) holding companies, with the exception of company-run stress tests.
U.S. Institutions Subject to EPR Under P.L. 115-174 The proposed rule that would implement P.L. 115-174 's changes to the $50 billion asset threshold creates four categories of banks based on their asset size and systemic importance, with increasingly stringent EPR requirements applied to each category as these characteristics increase.
In addition, over 80 foreign banks (including those in Table 2 ) would be required to submit resolution plans (or living wills) under a proposed rule, because they had more than $250 billion in worldwide assets and operate in the United States, regardless of the extent of their U.S. assets.
The firm-run liquidity stress tests apply to domestic banks with more than $100 billion in assets under the Fed's proposed rule.
The rule requires banks subject to EPR to establish a liquidity risk management framework involving a bank's management and board, conduct monthly internal liquidity stress tests, and maintain a buffer of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA).
Provisions Triggered in Response to Financial Stability Concerns Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act provides several powers for—depending on the provision—FSOC, the Fed, or the FDIC to use when the respective entity believes that a bank with more than $50 billion in assets or designated nonbank SIFI poses a threat to financial stability.
Basel III also required G-SIBs to hold relatively more capital than other banks in the form of a common equity surcharge of at least 1% to ""reflect the greater risks that they pose to the financial system."" In July 2015, the Fed issued a final rule that began phasing in this capital surcharge in 2016.
The banking regulators also issued a final rule implementing a Basel III countercyclical capital buffer applied to banks with more than $250 billion in assets or more $10 billion in foreign exposure.
The proposed rule implementing Section 402 estimates that the three eligible custody banks would be granted an exclusion equivalent to 21% to 30% of their assets and be able to reduce their capital requirements at the holding company level under the SLR by an aggregate $8 billion.
Incorporating the G-SIB Surcharge into the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio and the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity As noted in the "" Basel III Capital Requirements "" section, G-SIBs must currently comply with a higher SLR than other banks with $250 billion in assets."
147,"Small Business Microloans and Training Assistance The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers programs that support small businesses, including loan guarantees to lenders to encourage them to provide loans to small businesses ""that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions"" and grants to nonprofit organizations to provide marketing, management, and technical training assistance to small business owners.
to make loans to eligible intermediaries to enable such intermediaries to provide small-scale loans, particularly loans in amounts averaging not more than $10,000, to start-up, newly established, or growing small business concerns for working capital or the acquisition of materials, supplies, or equipment; [and] to make grants to eligible intermediaries that, together with non-Federal matching funds, will enable such intermediaries to provide intensive marketing, management, and technical assistance to microloan borrowers.
It also authorized the SBA to waive, in whole or in part through FY2012, the nonfederal share requirement for loans to the Microloan program's intermediaries and for grants made to Microloan intermediaries for small business marketing, management, and technical assistance for up to a fiscal year.
1857 , the Senate companion bill, would have increased the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $5 million to $6 million, increased the program's repayment terms from not more than 6 years to not more than 10 years for loans greater than $10,000, and required the SBA Administrator to establish a rule enabling intermediaries to apply for a waiver of the requirement that no more than 25% of Microloan technical assistance grant funds may be used to provide information and technical assistance to prospective borrowers.
S. 2850 , the Microloan Program Modernization Act of 2016, would have increased the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $5 million to $6 million and, among other provisions, eliminated the requirements that intermediaries spend no more than 25% of Microloan technical assistance grant funds on technical assistance to prospective borrowers and no more than 25% of those funds on third party contracts for technical assistance.

In addition, as mentioned earlier, P.L. 111-240 temporarily allowed the SBA to waive, in whole or in part through FY2012, the 25% nonfederal share requirement for grants made to Microloan intermediaries for small business marketing, management, and technical assistance under specified circumstances (e.g., the economic conditions affecting the intermediary and the intermediary's performance) for up to a fiscal year.
It also temporarily allowed the SBA to waive, in whole or in part through FY2012, the nonfederal share requirement for loans to the Microloan program's intermediaries and for grants made to Microloan intermediaries for small business marketing, management, and technical assistance under specified circumstances (e.g., the economic conditions affecting the intermediary and the intermediary's performance) for up to a fiscal year."
148,"The OASDI Trust Funds' Board of Trustees (the trustees) manages the trust funds according to requirements set forth in the Social Security Act. Under current law, the trust funds' assets may be invested only in U.S. government securities issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.
Current Policies and Practices3 Section 201(c) of the Social Security Act establishes the Board of Trustees of the OASDI Trust Funds and states that the Secretary of the Treasury shall be the managing trustee.
Note 142 concludes that ""the administrative policy governing early redemption of special obligations [special issues], in combination with the policy of spreading maturities, is designed to compensate at least partially for, or neutralize, the advantage of no-risk liquidity."" Principle 4: Minimal Management of Investment The parameters for the trust funds' investment set forth in the Social Security Act and the administrative policies adopted over time render active or day-to-day management of the trust funds' investments unnecessary.
If this equity premium persists, it would be possible to maintain Social Security benefits for all income groups of workers, greatly improving the money's worth for younger workers without incurring the risks that could accompany individual investment.… As a matter of financial theory, the diversification achieved by investing in both stocks and government bonds should also reduce portfolio risk for the OASDI Trust Fund.
As a result, the council's final report recommended investing a portion of the trust funds in equities to help alleviate pressure on the OASDI program's long-term actuarial balance.
Some critics of this approach are concerned that by investing in private companies and gaining some control over their activities, the federal government would be intervening in the market, resulting in what some have described as ""socialism by the backdoor method."" The advisory council reasoned as follows:  Another practical disadvantage would be the need for a far-reaching and deep-searching investment policy that would permit the trust funds to obtain an adequate rate of interest with reasonable security of principal.
Figure 3 displays the effective interest rate earned by the special issues in the combined OASDI Trust Funds and the returns of the equity market as measured by the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, or Wilshire 5000.
Table 1 shows that under current law, the long-range actuarial balance is -2.84% of taxable payroll, indicating that under intermediate assumptions provided in T he 2018 Annual Report , an approximately 2.84-percentage-point increase in payroll tax rate (from current the 12.40% to 15.24%) or a comparable reduction in benefits would be needed to maintain program solvency throughout the projection period and result in a trust funds ratio of 100% at the end of the projection period.
To acquire asset reserves of at least four years of annual program costs, thus maintaining a safeguard similar to the NRRIT's, the OASDI Trust Funds would require substantial revenue-increasing or benefit-reducing measures."
149,"The issue of regulation of and access to broadband networks is currently being addressed in three venues at the FCC, where the commissioners on December 14, 2017, adopted (3-2) an Order that went into effect on June 11, 2018, that revokes the 2015 regulatory framework in favor of one that reverses the 2015 classification of broadband internet access services as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act, provides for a less regulatory approach, and shifts much of the oversight from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ); in the courts, where consolidated petitions for review of the 2017 Order are under consideration in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit; and a suit filed in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of California by the DOJ and various trade groups, challenging the legality of a California internet regulation law, is pending; in the 116 th Congress, where debate over what the appropriate regulatory framework should be for broadband access continues.
The FCC argued that while it did not have express statutory authority over such practices, it derived such authority based on its ancillary authority contained in Title I of the 1934 Communications Act. The court, in an April 6, 2010, decision, ruled (3-0) that the FCC did not have the authority to regulate an internet service provider's (in this case Comcast's) network management practices and vacated the FCC's order.
Regardless of the path that is taken, then-FCC Chairman Genachowski stated that the court decision ""does not change our broadband policy goals, or the ultimate authority of the FCC to act to achieve those goals."" He further stated that ""[T]he court did not question the FCC's goals; it merely invalidated one, technical, legal mechanism for broadband policy chosen by prior Commissions."" Consistent with this statement, the FCC in a December 21, 2010, action adopted the Open Internet Order to establish rules to maintain network neutrality.
Additional provisions in the order included those which provided for ongoing monitoring of the mobile broadband sector and created an Open Internet Advisory Committee to track and evaluate the effects of the rules and provide recommendations to the FCC regarding open internet policies and practices; while not banning paid prioritization, stated that it was unlikely to satisfy the ""no unreasonable discrimination"" rule; raised concerns about specialized services and while not ""adopting policies specific to such services at this time,"" would closely monitor such services; called for review, and possible adjustment, of all rules in the order no later than two years from their effective date; and detailed a formal and informal complaint process.
The Federal Communications Commission Response In response to the court remand, then FCC Chairman Wheeler issued, on February 19, 2014, a statement outlining the steps proposed ""to ensure that the Internet remains a platform for innovation, economic growth, and free expression."" Chairman Wheeler proposed that the FCC establish new rules under its Section 706 authority that enforce and enhance the transparency rule that was upheld by the court; fulfill the ""no blocking"" goal; fulfill the goals of the nondiscrimination rule; leave open as an option the possible reclassification of internet access service as telecommunications service subject to Title II authority; forgo judicial review of the appeals court decision; solicit public comment; hold internet service providers to their commitment to honor the safeguards articulated in the 2010 Open Internet Order; and seek opportunities to enhance competition in the internet access market.
The order includes among its provisions the following: reclassifies ""broadband Internet access service"" (that is the retail broadband service Americans buy from cable, phone, and wireless providers) as a telecommunications service under Title II; bans blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization; creates a general conduct standard that internet service providers cannot harm consumers or edge providers (e.g., Google, Netflix) and gives the FCC the authority to address questionable practices on a case-by-case basis (reasonable network management will not be considered a violation of this rule); enhances existing transparency rules for both end users and edge providers (a temporary exemption from the transparency enhancements is given for small fixed and mobile providers) and creates a ""safe harbor"" process for the format and nature of the required disclosure for consumers; permits an internet service provider to engage in ""reasonable network management"" (other than paid prioritization) and will take into account the specific network management needs of mobile networks and other technologies such as unlicensed Wi-Fi networks; does not apply the open internet rules to ""non-BIAS data services,"" (aka, specialized services) a category of services defined by the FCC as those that ""do not provide access to the Internet generally"" (e.g., heart monitors or energy consumption sensors); does not apply the open internet rules to interconnection but does gives the FCC authority to hear complaints and take enforcement action, if necessary, on a case-by-case basis, under Sections 201 and 202, regarding interconnection activities of internet service providers if deemed unjust and unreasonable; applies major provisions of Title II such as no unjust and unreasonable practices or discrimination, consumer privacy, disability access, consumer complaint and enforcement processes, and fair access to poles and conduits; and forbears, without any further proceedings, from various Title II provisions (e.g., cost accounting rules, tariffs, and last-mile unbundling) resulting in forbearance from 30 statutory provisions and over 700 codified rules.
More specifically, the NPR proposed to reinstate the information service classification of broadband internet access service (both fixed and mobile), thereby removing the service from the Title II, common carrier classification imposed by the 2015 Open Internet Order and placing it under Title I; reinstate that mobile broadband internet access service is not a commercial mobile service; eliminate the general conduct standard; seek comment on the need to ""keep, modify, or eliminate"" the ""bright line"" (no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization) and transparency rules; return authority to the Federal Trade Commission to oversee and enforce the privacy practices of internet service providers; reevaluate the FCC's enforcement regime with respect to the necessity for ex ante regulatory intervention; and conduct a cost-benefit analysis as part of the proceeding.
According to the FCC the 2017 Order framework has three parts The FTC will assume the major role and will take action against internet service providers that undertake anticompetitive acts or unfair and deceptive practices; Internet service providers will be subject to enhanced transparency requirements and must publically disclose, via a publically available, easily accessible company website or through the FCC's website, information regarding their network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of service; and Broadband internet access services are reclassified as information services, and regulations imposed by the 2015 Order are vacated, including the classification of broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to common carrier Title II classification; the ""bright line"" no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization rules; and the general conduct standard.
Provisions include those that prohibit blocking and unjust and discriminatory behavior, subject to reasonable network management; establish transparency requirements; establish FCC enforcement authority, including the authority to issue fines and forfeitures up to $2 million; in general, prohibit the FCC from imposing regulations on BIAS services under Title II; protect the needs of emergency communications, law enforcement, public safety or national security, copyright infringement or other unlawful activity; and preserve the authority of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
H.R. 1096 , introduced on February 7, 2019, by Representative Rodgers, amends Title I of the Communications Act to require rules applicable to BIAS providers that establish transparency requirements; prohibit blocking and degrading (throttling) lawful traffic, subject to reasonable network management; prohibit paid prioritization; and contain a savings clause relating to emergency communications, law enforcement, public safety or national security, copyright infringement or other unlawful activity.
Additional provisions require the FCC to enforce these rules through adjudication of complaints and establish, no later than 60 days after enactment, formal complaint procedures to address alleged violations; protect the needs of emergency communications, law enforcement, public safety or national security, copyright infringement or other unlawful activity; protect the ability of BIAS providers to offer specialized services and the right of consumers to choice of service plans or control over their chosen BIAS; and establish that BIAS or any other mass-market retail service providing advanced telecommunications capability shall be considered an information service and that Section 706 may not be relied upon as a grant of authority.
2853 ) to provide a regulatory framework to outline FCC authority over broadband internet access services; and measures to address the privacy and transparency regulations of the 2015 Order.
More specifically, provisions contained in both measures included those which prohibited broadband internet access service (BIAS) providers from blocking lawful content or degrading (throttling) lawful internet traffic, subject to reasonable network management; granted FCC enforcement authority and required the FCC to establish formal complaint procedures to address alleged violations; preserved the ability of BIAS providers to offer, with a prohibition on certain practices, specialized services; established BIAS as an information service; and preempted state and local authority over ""internet openness obligations"" for the provision of BIAS with exceptions for emergency communications or law enforcement, public safety, or national security obligations.
This measure prevented the FCC from regulating providers of broadband internet access services under Title II of the Communications Act. Representative Blackburn, in direct response to the FCC's February 26, 2015, adoption of the Open Internet Order, introduced H.R. 1212 , the ""Internet Freedom Act,"" on March 3, 2015.
These principles are as follows: prohibit blocking; prohibit throttling; prohibit paid prioritization; require transparency; apply rules to both wireline and wireless; allow for reasonable network management; allow for specialized services; protect consumer choice; classify broadband internet access as an information service under the Communications Act; clarify that Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act may not be used as a grant of regulatory authority; and direct the FCC to enforce and abide by these principles."
150,"(Those years show up as zeros in their Social Security earnings records, which, when averaged, lower their career earnings from covered work.) Consequently, workers who split their careers between covered and noncovered employment—even highly paid ones—may also receive the advantage of the weighted formula.
The windfall elimination provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula designed to remove the unintended advantage, or ""windfall,"" of the regular benefit formula for certain retired or disabled workers who spent less than full careers in covered employment and who are also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs not covered by Social Security.
The averaging provision in the benefit formula tends to cause workers with short careers in Social Security-covered employment to have low AIMEs, even if they had high earnings in their noncovered career, similar to people who worked for low earnings in covered employment throughout their careers."
151,"Trade promotion authority (TPA), sometimes called ""fast track,"" refers to the process Congress has made available to the President for limited periods to enable legislation to approve and implement certain international trade agreements to be considered under expedited legislative procedures.
Certain trade agreements negotiated by the President, such as agreements that reduce barriers to trade in ways that require changes in U.S. law, must be approved and implemented by Congress through legislation.
More generally, TPA defines how Congress has chosen to exercise its constitutional authority over a particular aspect of trade policy, while affording the President added leverage and credibility to negotiate trade agreements by giving trading partners assurance that final agreements can receive consideration by Congress in a timely manner and without amendments.
An example is the historical reciprocal tariff agreement authority described under the next question.) TPA legislation provides expedited legislative procedures (also known as ""fast track"" procedures) to facilitate congressional action on legislation to approve and implement trade agreements of the kinds specified in the TPA statute.
This policy changed with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, in which Congress delegated temporary authority to the President to enter into (sign) reciprocal trade agreements that reduced tariffs within preapproved levels and implement them by proclamation without further congressional action.
Because an implementing bill faced potential amendment by Members of Congress that could alter a long-negotiated agreement, Congress adopted fast track authority in the Trade Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-618 ) to ensure that the implementing bill could receive floor consideration and to provide a procedure under which it could not be amended.
No. If the United States enters into (signs) a trade agreement within a period for which TPA is provided, the President may submit the implementing bill to Congress a day on which both the House and the Senate are in session, regardless of whether TPA expired before that date.
The principal trade negotiating objective concerning trade remedies in TPA-2015 and previous TPA legislation has been to ""preserve the ability of the United States to rigorously enforce its trade laws"" and to avoid concluding ""agreements that weaken the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade."" Trade remedies have usually been addressed in the context of multilateral WTO negotiations, though some FTAs have included commitments related to trade remedies.
TPA-2015 also maintains past notification provisions that require the President to notify Congress about any proposals advanced in a negotiation that involve potential changes to U.S. trade remedy laws 180 days before signing (entering into) a trade agreement.
The Hatch/Wyden amendment modified the currency language of the bill as introduced, defining unfair currency practices as ""protracted large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange market and a persistently undervalued foreign exchange rate to gain an unfair competitive advantage in trade."" The amended objective seeks to ""establish accountability"" through potential remedies such as ""enforceable rules, transparency, reporting, monitoring, cooperative mechanism, or other means to address exchange rate manipulation."" The legislation contains the original negotiating objective, as well as the language of the Hatch/Wyden amendment.
Human Rights  TPA-2015 contains a negotiating objective to ensure the implementation of trade commitments through promotion of good governance, transparency, and the rule of law with U.S. trade partners, ""which are important parts of the broader effort to create more open democratic societies and to promote respect for internationally recognized human rights."" During floor consideration, the Senate adopted unopposed an amendment by Senator Lankford to add an overall negotiating objective to ""take into account conditions relating to religious freedom of any party to negotiations for a trade agreement with the United States."" What New Negotiating Objectives Were Added as a Result of Senate Consideration?
These five amendments added the following: An overall negotiating objective ""to ensure that trade agreements do not require changes to the immigration laws or obligate the United States to grant access or expand access to visas issued under....
TPA/fast track statutes have required the USTR to meet and consult with the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and other committees that have jurisdiction over laws possibly affected by trade negotiations.
The TPA/fast track authorities under the Trade Act of 1974, and under authorities thereafter, have required the President to submit reports from the various advisory committees on their views regarding the potential impact of an agreement negotiated under the TPA before the agreement is submitted for congressional approval.
To support this statement, the President submits an explanation of how the implementing bill and administrative action will ""change or affect U.S. law."" The President is also to submit with the draft implementing bill a statement explaining how the agreement makes progress in achieving the ""purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives"" of the TPA, whether it changes an agreement previously negotiated, and how it ""serves the interests of United States commerce,"" as well as how the implementing bill meets the requirement that its provisions altering existing law are ""strictly necessary or appropriate."" Must Congress consider covered trade agreements under the expedited legislative procedures?
An additional procedure, under which Congress could find that an implementing bill would change U.S. trade remedy laws in ways inconsistent with negotiating objectives on that subject.
TPA-2015 retains a procedural mechanism from the 2002 authority, under which either house can adopt a simple resolution (H.Res. or S.Res.) finding that changes to U.S. trade remedy laws provided for in a trade agreement implementing bill submitted by the President are inconsistent with statutory negotiating objectives on that subject."
152,"Accordingly, the district court dismissed the lawsuit for failing to state a claim for relief under the Second Amendment, reasoning that it ""would be in error to overlook sixty-five years of unchanged Supreme Court precedent and the deluge of circuit case law rejecting an individual right to bear arms not in conjunction with service in the Militia."" Parker v.
And as for the kind of weapons that may obtain Second Amendment protection, the Court noted that Miller limits Second Amendment coverage to weapons ""in common use at the time"" that the reviewing court is examining a particular firearm, which, the Court added, ""is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons."" Second Amendment Analysis of D.C.'s Firearms Regulations Finally, the Supreme Court applied the Second Amendment, as newly interpreted, to the contested D.C. firearm regulations—which amounted to a near-total handgun ban—and concluded that they were unconstitutional.
First, the Court declared that possessing weapons for self-defense is ""central to the Second Amendment right,"" yet the District's handgun ban prohibits ""an entire class of 'arms' that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose."" Moreover, the handgun prohibition extended into the home, where, the Court added, ""the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute."" Additionally, the requirement that firearms in the home be kept inoperable is unconstitutional because, the Court concluded, that requirement ""makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense."" Thus, the Court ruled, the District's handgun ban could not survive under any level of scrutiny that a court typically would apply to a constitutional challenge of an enumerated right.
Justice Breyer suggested an interest-balancing inquiry in which a court would evaluate ""the interests protected by the Second Amendment on one side and the governmental public-safety concerns on the other, the only question being whether the regulation at issue impermissibly burdens the former in the course of advancing the latter."" In making that evaluation, Justice Breyer would ask ""how the statute seeks to further the governmental interests that it serves, how the statute burdens the interests that the Second Amendment seeks to protect, and whether there are practical less burdensome ways of furthering those interests."" Applying those questions to the challenged D.C. laws, Justice Breyer concluded that (1) the laws sought to further compelling public-safety interests; (2) the D.C. restrictions minimally burdened the Second Amendment's purpose to preserve a ""well regulated Militia"" and burdened ""to some degree"" an interest in self-defense; and (3) there were no reasonable but less restrictive alternatives to reducing the number of handguns in the District.
warrant[s] characterizing it as 'fundamental' insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes."" Additionally, he asserted that the Constitution provides no authority for ""transferring ultimate regulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from democratically elected legislators to courts or from the States to the Federal Government."" Justice Stevens authored another dissenting opinion, arguing that the question before the Court was not whether the Second Amendment, as a whole, applies to the states, but rather whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the liberty interest asserted—""the right to possess a functional, personal firearm, including a handgun, within the home""—be enforceable against the states.
It is also worth noting that, although the D.C. Circuit has applied the two-step approach when evaluating firearm legislation, the newest member of the Supreme Court bench—Justice Kavanaugh—advocated for a different approach while serving as a judge on the D.C. Circuit, arguing that: ""In my view,"" he stated, "" Heller and McDonald leave little doubt that courts are to assess gun bans and regulations based on text, history, and tradition, not by a balancing test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny.""  Step One: Scope of Second Amendment Protection The first question in the two-part framework asks whether the challenged law targets conduct within the scope of the Second Amendment's protections.
At step two, the court applied intermediate scrutiny, concluding that the age-based restriction does not burden the Second Amendment's core protections of law-abiding, responsible citizens, because ""Congress found that persons under 21 tend to be relatively irresponsible and can be prone to violent crime, especially when they have easy access to handguns."" Nor does the restriction prevent 18- to 21-year-olds from possessing handguns for self-defense in the home because, the court added, these persons may lawfully acquire handguns from responsible parents or guardians.
Staten, the Fourth Circuit concluded that there is a reasonable fit between § 922(g)(9) and a substantial governmental interest—reducing domestic gun violence—because the government had established that domestic violence in the United States is a serious problem with high rates of recidivism, and, additionally, the ""use of firearms in connection with domestic violence is all too common.""  Another circuit court, however, concluded that § 922(g)(9) is a presumptively lawful prohibition on the possession of firearms that need not be evaluated under a particular level of scrutiny.
White reasoned that § 922(g)(9) was passed, in part, because Congress had recognized that domestic violence with firearms had not been remedied by ""longstanding felon-in-possession laws,"" and thus the court ""s[aw] no reason to exclude § 922(g)(9) from the list of longstanding prohibitions on which Heller does not cast doubt."" Additionally, the Seventh Circuit sitting en banc and using its unique approach upheld § 922(g)(9) as constitutional after concluding that the government made a ""strong showing"" that § 922(g)(9) is substantially related to an important governmental objective.
Intermediate scrutiny was appropriate because, the court reasoned, a person subject to a domestic violence restraining order is not entitled to the benefit of the ""core right identified in Heller —the right of a law-abiding, responsible citizen to possess and carry a weapon for self-defense."" In applying intermediate scrutiny the Fourth Circuit concluded that the government established a reasonable fit between § 922(g)(8) and the government's substantial interest in reducing domestic gun violence.
to leave the premises and use [a firearm] against those that sought the protections of the protective order."" The court did not find it relevant that the defendant did not actually leave the shooting range with the handgun and incite violence, because the intermediate scrutiny standard of review applicable to the challenged restriction, in the court's view, ""has never been held to require a perfect end-means fit."" Accordingly, the court concluded that ""[i]t is sufficient that § 922(g)(8) rests on an established link between domestic abuse, recidivism, and gun violence and applies to persons already individually adjudged in prior protective order to pose a future threat of abuse."" Unlawful Drug Users and Addicts 18 U.S.C.
Unlike in other cases, the government had not provided any studies, empirical data, or legislative findings to support the restriction, and instead it had argued that ""the fit was a matter of common sense."" However, the court noted that the government's burden on remand ""should not be difficult to satisfy,"" given that evidence of danger of mixing drugs and guns was, in the court's view, ""abundantly available."" And on remand, the government indeed presented numerous studies showing a correlation between violent crime and drug use, which the Fourth Circuit ultimately found to substantiate the government's contention that ""disarming drug users reasonably serves the important governmental interest of protecting the community from gun violence."" Aliens Another provision of the Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C.
Huitron-Guizar assumed that unlawfully present aliens, like the defendant—who also had been in the United States for decades and was brought to the country as a young child—could assert a Second Amendment right, noting that ""we hesitate to infer from Heller a rule that the right to bear arms is categorically inapplicable to non-citizens."" Applying intermediate scrutiny to § 922(g)(5), the court concluded that the law is constitutional, deferring to Congress's ""constitutional power to distinguish between citizens and non-citizens, or between lawful and unlawful aliens, and to ensure safety and order."" Ultimately, the court found a substantial fit between the government's interests in crime control and public safety, and its desire to keep firearms out of the hands of those it deems as ""irresponsible or dangerous.""  What Categories of Firearms May Be Subject to Government Regulation?
The court concluded that banning a certain type of ammunition does not substantially burden the Second Amendment right to use firearms for self-defense because the restriction burdens only the manner in which that right is exercised, and thus ought to be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny.
The circuit court found that, although the law implicates the core of the Second Amendment right by imposing restrictions on the use of handguns in the home, unlike the former D.C. law evaluated in Heller requiring handguns to be made completely inoperable, the burden in San Francisco's law was not substantial, and thus intermediate scrutiny was warranted.
Moreover, the court noted that, although the law makes it more difficult for residents to use handguns for self-defense in the home by having to retrieve the firearm from a locked container or remove a trigger lock, the requirement still burdens only the manner in which persons exercise their Second Amendment right.
Justice Thomas described Jackson as ""in serious tension with Heller "" by prohibiting San Francisco residents from keeping their handguns ""'operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense,' when not carried on their person."" Justice Thomas added that such a burden on a core Second Amendment right ""is significant,"" stating that ""nothing in our decision in Heller suggested that a law must rise to the level of the absolute prohibition at issue in that case to constitute a 'substantial burden' on the core of the Second Amendment right."" Government Property Challenges brought against firearm prohibitions on federal property raise the question of whether such prohibitions fall into Heller's safe harbor for ""sensitive places."" For instance, by regulation, firearms are prohibited on U.S. postal property."
153,"Introduction Social Security is a self-financing program that provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers.
Before the Old-Age Insurance program was in full operation, the Social Security Amendments of 1939 shifted the emphasis of Social Security from protection of the individual worker to protection of the family by extending monthly cash benefits to the dependents and survivors of workers.
The trustees project that the trust funds will have a positive balance (asset reserves) until 2035, allowing Social Security benefits scheduled under current law to be paid in full and on time until then.
For illustration purposes, the trustees point out that the following cha nges would be needed for the trust funds to remain solvent throughout the 75-year projection period: (1) an immediate 2.70-percentage-point increase in the payroll tax rate (from 12.40% to 15.10%); or (2) an immediate 17% reduction in benefits for all current and future beneficiaries; or (3) some combination of these approaches.
Rather, the program relies on revenues collected for Social Security purposes in previous years that were used by the federal government at the time for other (non-Social Security) spending needs and interest income earned on trust fund investments.
Table 3 provides a summary of Social Security benefits payable to the family members of a retired, disabled, or deceased worker."

155,"The federal budget is constructed in a manner that provides for lower net deficits in more robust economic conditions, attributable to higher revenues (from taxes on increased output) and, to a smaller degree, lower spending levels (from reduced demand for programs like unemployment insurance).
From FY1969 to FY2018, annual nominal budget deficits and surpluses of the federal government summed to $13.745 trillion; over the same period, total debt held by the public increased by $15.473 trillion.
Deficit financing, or payment for federal government activity at least partly through debt increases, increases the total level of spending in the economy.
(3) ΔY= f(ΔL, ΔK, ΔA) Assuming that the stock of labor is insensitive to fiscal policy choices, the effect of federal debt on economic growth depends on how the additional government activity affects the capital stock and productivity of labor and capital relative to what would have happened had amounts borrowed been invested privately or increased net exports.
For instance, from FY2009 through FY2018, federal deficits averaged 5.3% of GDP, and real economic growth averaged 1.76% per year over the same period; those factors combined to increase federal publicly held debt from 39% of GDP at the beginning of FY2008 to 78% of GDP at the end of FY2018.
CBO projects increases in both interest rates and publicly held federal debt over the next 10 years, leading to a significant rise in U.S. net interest payments."
156,"The report closes with considerations for Congress in conducting its oversight role over U.S. funded anti-corruption efforts in the region and pursuing the policy objective of broadening the rule of law and encouraging good government.
The number of grand-scale scandals exposed in recent years in the region, such as payoff schemes involving high court justices and top-level officials, has led some voters to conclude that all parties and politicians are corrupt, resulting in presidents and vice presidents being pushed from office and traditional political parties being viewed as corrupt and illegitimate.
These anti-corruption campaigns may prove more enduring, however, as civil society organizations are attempting to build on their preliminary successes by pushing for institutional reforms to enhance transparency and accountability throughout the public sector.
Early Anti-corruption Approaches  U.S. foreign assistance programs to bolster rule of law, encourage good governance, and eliminate bribery, extortion, and graft have been common in Latin America for about three decades.
Anti-corruption programming sponsored by the United States and major international financial institutions grew out of ferment in the 1970s, when the long-time practice of businesses and foreign corporations paying bribes to gain contracts in developing countries was exposed (see textbox on Select International Efforts to Combat Corruption).
In 1997, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with strong support from the United States, adopted the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
In addition, an array of former high-level government officials in Brazil, such as Aécio Neves, a former senator, governor, and 2014 presidential candidate for the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, face investigations for taking Odebrecht bribes for favorable consideration of legislation preferred by Odebrecht.
For several years, U.S. foreign assistance has been provided to fight corruption and enhance the rule of law in Latin America (including judicial training), to improve law-enforcement techniques to conduct investigations, make arrests and properly handle evidence, and enhance oversight of civil society for better accountability.
Relevant assistance provided by the U.S. government to combat corruption includes assistance and efforts by U.S. State Department, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), outlined below.
Anti-corruption activities are integrated in the strategy of each USAID country mission and embassy, and therefore may influence programs beyond democracy and good governance to include such areas as health, education, economic growth, and promotion of environmental and natural resources management.
Some funds for anti-corruption and justice programs abroad involve transfers from the State Department to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), such as the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), which is a law enforcement development agency.
In Mexico, the United States has supported rule of law reforms to increase judicial independence, reduce impunity, and protect journalists in the context of a strong central government.
U.S. efforts have included programs aimed at supporting the country's transition to an accusatorial justice system, establishing a National Anti-corruption System (NAS), bolstering transparency and oversight of government programs, and supporting investigative journalism.
U.S. assistance (1) has helped the federal and state governments adopt legislative frameworks to underpin the reform process, (2) provided in-depth training for justice sector operators on their roles in the system, and (3) built support for the reforms in Mexican civil society.
National Anticorruption System and Related Efforts to Improve Transparency  In 2015, the Mexican congress approved and President Peña Nieto signed constitutional reforms creating a system to prevent and punish corruption following intense and sustained lobbying by civil society and the private sector.
USAID has provided support to Mexican government (federal and state) anti-corruption and public administration entities, as well as efforts organized by private sector and civil society groups.
An independent, international entity, CICIG's mandate is to support, strengthen and assist Guatemalan state institutions in investigating, prosecuting, and dismantling illegal groups and clandestine structures responsible for organized crime, human rights violations and other crimes, and to propose effective legal reforms.
In its annual report on drug policy, the U.S. State Department highlighted these accomplishments and concerns in March 2019:  Guatemala's Attorney General and the UN-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) have investigated hundreds of government officials suspected of corruption.
Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras115 U.S. policy in Honduras is guided by the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, which is intended to promote economic prosperity, strengthen governance, and improve security in the region, and thereby mitigate migration and security threats to the United States.
MACCIH officials also are working alongside a recently established anti-corruption unit within the public prosecutor's office ( Unidad Fiscal Especial Contra la Impunidad de la Corrupción , UFECIC) to jointly investigate and prosecute high-level corruption cases.
Their anti-corruption efforts are likely to face sustained resistance from all three branches of the Honduran government, however, and further progress will likely require continued financial and diplomatic support from the United States and other international donors.
In Mexico, the United States has worked for years to strengthen the Mexican justice system and help to reform it, and also to support an integrated anti-corruption system, although both new systems have only partially been put into practice.
In August 2018, Congress enacted the FY2019 defense authorization measure, P.L. 115-232 ( H.R. 5515 ), with several Latin America provisions, which include required reports on narcotics trafficking, corruption, and illicit campaign financing in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, including identifying government officials involved in such activities.
The Trump Administration has rarely applauded civil society activism in Latin America and Caribbean countries in response to high-level scandals and public corruption.
The Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), recommends key targets for reform in the region, which are: (1) political party and campaign financing; (2) public financial sector management; (3) government contracting and procurement, especially for critical infrastructure; (4) civil service reform and effective vetting of public officials; and (5) internal strengthening and oversight of public security and justice institutions."
157,"Temporary Protected Status (TPS), codified by INA Section 244, provides temporary relief from removal and work authorization to foreign nationals in the United States from countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances that prevent their safe return.
The statute gives the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with other government agencies (most notably the Department of State), the authority to designate a country for TPS under one or more of the following conditions: ongoing armed conflict in a foreign state that poses a serious threat to personal safety; a foreign state request for TPS because it temporarily cannot handle the return of its nationals due to an environmental disaster; or extraordinary and temporary conditions in a foreign state that prevent its nationals from safely returning.
To obtain TPS, eligible foreign nationals within the United States must pay specified fees and submit an application to DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) before the deadline set forth in the Federal Register notice announcing the TPS designation.
In December 1997, President Bill Clinton instructed the Attorney General to grant DED to Haitian nationals in the United States for one year, providing time for the Administration to work with Congress on long-term legislative relief for Haitians.
Table 1 lists the current TPS-designated countries, the most recent decision—to extend or terminate—by the Secretary of DHS, the date from which individuals are required to have continuously resided in the United States, and the designation's expiration date.
At the time, then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano stated: ""Providing a temporary refuge for Haitian nationals who are currently in the United States and whose personal safety would be endangered by returning to Haiti is part of this Administration's continuing efforts to support Haiti's recovery."" On July 13, 2010, DHS announced an extension of the TPS registration period for Haitian nationals, citing difficulties nationals were experiencing in obtaining documents to establish identity and nationality, and in gathering funds required to apply for TPS."
158,"In devising a 30-year shipbuilding plan to move the Navy toward its ship force-structure goal, key assumptions and planning factors include but are not limited to ship construction times and service lives, estimated ship procurement costs, projected shipbuilding funding levels, and industrial-base considerations.
Potential for Cost Growth on Navy Ships If one or more Navy ship designs turn out to be more expensive to build than the Navy estimates, then the projected funding levels shown in Figure 3 would not be sufficient to procure all the ships shown in the 30-year shipbuilding plan.
(This report also covers the issue of funding for the procurement of an amphibious assault ship called LHA-9.) CRS Report R43546, Navy John Lewis (TAO-205) Class Oiler Shipbuilding Program: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke.
(This report also covers the issue of funding for the procurement of an amphibious assault ship called LHA-9.) CRS Report R43546, Navy John Lewis (TAO-205) Class Oiler Shipbuilding Program: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke.
In coming years, Navy missions may shift again, and the capabilities of Navy ships will likely have changed further by that time due to developments such as more comprehensive implementation of networking technology, increased use of ship-based unmanned vehicles, and the potential fielding of new types of weapons such as lasers or electromagnetic rail guns.
Previous Navy force structure plans, such as those shown in Table B-1 , might provide some insight into the potential adequacy of a proposed new force-structure plan, but changes over time in mission requirements, technologies available to ships for performing missions, and other force-planning factors, as well as the possibility that earlier force-structure plans might not have been appropriate for meeting the mission demands of their times, suggest that some caution should be applied in using past force structure plans for this purpose, particularly if those past force structure plans are more than a few years old.
Navy shipbuilding rates could not be increased steeply across the board overnight—time (and investment) would be needed to hire and train additional workers and increase production facilities at shipyards and supplier firms, particularly for supporting higher rates of submarine production.
However, certain sectors face greater obstacles in constructing ships at faster rates than others: Building more submarines to meet the goals of the 2016 force structure assessment would pose the greatest challenge to the shipbuilding industry.
In addition, industry and Navy sources indicate that as much as $4 billion would need to be invested in the physical infrastructure of the shipyards to achieve the higher production rates required under the [notional] 15-year and 20-year [buildup scenarios examined by CBO].
""In fact, if you talked to industry, they would say we're underutilizing the facilities that we have."" The areas where the Navy would likely have to adjust ""tooling"" to answer demand for a larger fleet would likely be in Virginia-class attack submarines and large surface combatants, the DDG-51 guided missile destroyers—two ship classes likely to surge if the Navy gets funding to build to 355 ships, he said.
""In certain cases, that means not laying off the skilled workforce we want to retain."" A January 17, 2017, press report states the following: Building stable designs with active production lines is central to the Navy's plan to grow to 355 ships.
So we have hot production lines that will take us to that 355-ship Navy."" A January 24, 2017, press report states the following: Navy officials say a recently determined plan to increase its fleet size by adding more new submarines, carriers and destroyers is ""executable"" and that early conceptual work toward this end is already underway....
A January 12, 2017, press report states the following: Brian Cuccias, president of Ingalls Shipbuilding [a shipyard owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) that builds Navy destroyers and amphibious ships as well as Coast Guard cutters], said Ingalls, which is currently building 10 ships for four Navy and Coast Guard programs at its 800-acre facility in Pascagoula, Miss., could build more because it is using only 70 to 75 percent of its capacity.
Casey, executive vice president–marine systems, General Dynamics Corporation (one of the country's two principal builders of Navy ships) stated the following: It is our belief that the Nation's shipbuilding industrial base can scale-up hot production lines for existing ships and mobilize additional resources to accomplish the significant challenge of achieving the 355-ship Navy as quickly as possible....
The entire submarine industrial base at all levels of the supply chain will likely need to recapitalize some portion of its facilities, workforce, and supply chain just to support the current plan to build the Columbia Class SSBN program, while concurrently building Virginia Class SSNs. Additional SSN procurement will require industry to expand its plans and associated investment beyond the level today....
Positive signals of commitment from the Government must go beyond a published 30-year Navy Shipbuilding Plan and line items in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) and should include: Multi-year contracting for Block procurement which provides stability in the industrial base and encourages investment in facilities and workforce development Funding for supplier development to support training, qualification, and facilitization efforts—Electric Boat and Newport News have recommended to the Navy funding of $400M over a three-year period starting in 2018 to support supplier development for the Submarine Industrial Base as part of an Integrated Enterprise Plan Extended Enterprise initiative Acceleration of Advance Procurement and/or Economic Order Quantities (EOQ) procurement from FY19 to FY18 for Virginia Block V Government incentives for construction readiness and facilities / special tooling for shipyard and supplier facilities, which help cash flow capital investment ahead of construction contract awards Procurement of additional production back-up (PBU) material to help ensure a ready supply of material to mitigate construction schedule risk....
The recent CBO report on the costs of building a 355-ship Navy accurately summarized NASSCO's ability to reach the above production rate stating, ""building more … combat logistics and support ships would be the least problematic for the shipyards."" At the same hearing, Brian Cuccias, president, Ingalls Shipbuilding, Huntington Ingalls Industries (the country's other principal builder of Navy ships) stated the following: Qualifying to be a supplier is a difficult process."
159,"Aside from funding, other potential issues of for many in Congress and the research community may include allocating funding across disease types, areas of human health, and types of research; addressing congressional priorities and concerns, while ensuring the scientific merit and quality of NIH-funded research; helping new and early-stage investigators obtain their first independent research grants; maintaining the United States' role as a leader in biomedical research; balancing the public and private sectors' relative roles in biomedical research.
This report provides background and analysis on NIH organization, mission, budget, and history; outlines the agency's major responsibilities; and discusses some of the issues facing Congress as it works to guide and monitor the nation's investment in medical research.
""From the middle 1940s to 1974, health advocates were successful in persuading Congress to establish additional institutes, often against the wishes of administrations, which generally opposed creation of new categorical institutes."" Health advocacy ""groups have continued the long established pattern of pushing for creation of named entities at NIH to create focal points for developing more research funding for particular diseases.
Through continued pressure, offices may then be elevated to centers and, in some cases, to institute status."" The 2003 NAS report noted challenges with NIH's large and decentralized organizational structure, but said that any proposals for changing the number of ICs or OD program offices should be subject to a public evaluation process.
Information from the tracking system assists the Director and DPCPSI in planning trans-NIH research initiatives that cannot be handled within individual ICs. The reporting system, called Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT), ""provides access to reports, data, and analyses of NIH research activities, including information on NIH expenditures and the results of NIH-supported research."" The Reform Act did not contain any provisions on specific diseases or fields of research, nor did it eliminate or consolidate any existing ICs. However, it did provide certain authorities to HHS and NIH officials for making organizational changes to NIH.
The Strategic Plan is expected to provide direction to the biomedical investments made by NIH, facilitate IC collaboration, leverage scientific opportunity, and advance biomedicine (for more information about the 2016-20 NIH-Wide Strategic Plan, see "" NIH Process in Setting Research Priorities ."") The act also changed the biennial report of the NIH Director to Congress to a triennial requirement.
Other types of grants are provided to groups of researchers who work in collaborative programs or in multidisciplinary centers that focus on particular diseases or areas of research, often called ""centers of excellence."" Data on awards and recipients by state, by congressional district, by type of institution, and by subject of the research, are available on the NIH website.
Peer Review Process for Extramural Funding Scientists who wish to compete for NIH extramural research funding, whether for totally new proposals or for renewal of previous grant awards, submit detailed plans in their grant applications describing the research they plan to undertake.
Section 2033 of the 21 st Century Cures Act ( P.L. 115-255 ) added a new requirement that the IC Director weigh the Advisory Board or Council's advice against the IC's mission and research priorities, the NIH-Wide Strategic Plan, and programs or projects funded by other ICs on similar topics before awarding a research grant.
The total NIH budget is called the ""program level."" Discretionary funding for NIH comes primarily from the annual Labor-HHS-Education (LHHS) appropriations bill, which funds the agency through 27 separate accounts, including the 24 ICs with research grant-awarding authority.
The presentations and discussions allow NIH management to develop the budget request it will submit to HHS, taking into account the estimated funding amount needed to support the ""commitment base"" of continuing awards, the funding desired for unsolicited new research proposals, the new initiatives that the Director wants to incorporate, and guidance from the department about the request (e.g., there might be an instruction to pay no inflation increases on grants).
From FY2001 through FY2014, Congress provided broad directives to NIH in report language, encouraging the agency to prioritize Alzheimer's disease and to increase resources toward its research through the National Institute on Aging (NIA).
Cures Acceleration Network The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) allows NIH to award large grants of up to $15 million per year (that require a 1:3 matching ratio), and other flexible awards, to ""advance the development of high-need cures and reduce significant barriers between research discovery and clinical trials."" CAN grant recipients can be public or private entities, including institutions of higher education, pharmaceutical companies, and disease advocacy organizations.
NIH then makes awards to public or private research entities, including medical centers, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, and patient advocacy groups in order to accelerate the development of such high-need cures.
Title I of the Cures Act, Section 1001 establishes the ""NIH Innovation Account"" to which specified amounts are authorized to be transferred for each of FY2017 through FY2026 (see Table 1 ) for the purpose of carrying out the following four NIH Innovation Projects: The Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) All of Us Research Program ($1.5 billion for FY2017 through FY2026), which is collecting clinical, environmental, lifestyle, and genetic data from more than 1 million participants over many years.
Finally, Title II extends NCATS's authority to support clinical trial activities, consolidates existing NIH intramural loan repayment programs, specifies administrative requirements for PMI and ClinicalTrials.gov, and establishes a working group to make recommendations to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of NIH-funded scientific research, among other provisions.
The IC strategic planning processes are conducted pursuant to PHSA Section 402(b)(5), which specifies that the NIH Director ""shall ensure that scientifically based strategic planning is implemented in support of research priorities as determined by the agencies of the National Institutes of Health.""  The Cures Act ( P.L. 114-255 ) amended PHSA Section 402 to require an NIH-Wide Strategic Plan, in part to facilitate IC collaboration and coordination.
It ""identifies important areas of emerging scientific opportunity or rising public health challenges to assist in the acceleration of research investments in these areas."" The Office of Strategic Coordination within DPCPSI manages the NIH Common Fund, which supports large complex research efforts that involve the collaboration of two or more research institutes or centers.
In the report accompanying H.R. 6470 , the House Appropriations Committee stated that it did not include the general provision in the budget request to limit the percentage of a researcher's salary that may be paid for using NIH grant funds, as the impact of such a change is unclear.
The report stated, ""The Committee requests an analysis of the projected impact of such a policy change on the number and average cost of NIH grants, as well as on academic institutions, in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Justification""  The FY2020 budget request, again, included the proposal to cap the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds at 90%.
In addition, the FY2020 budget request would provide $100 million in dedicated funding for NGRI, and the request stated:  in response to an advisory committee recommendation and a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences, NIH is creating a new pathway for applications from early-stage investigators that does not require preliminary data and continues to provide a separate review of applications.
Finally, Congress may consider how to help NIH support new and early-stage scientists, maintain its role as a global leader in biomedical research, and balance the public and private sector's role in research and innovation."
160,"Through both negotiated reciprocal trade agreements and unilateral action, countries around the world, including the United States, have reduced their tariff rates over the past several decades, some by considerable margins.
In addition to addressing these specific concerns, the President also states he is using the tariffs to pressure affected countries into broader trade negotiations to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers, such as the announced trade agreement negotiations with the EU and Japan, and to lower the U.S. trade deficit.
President Trump's recently imposed tariff increases are of note because they are significantly higher than average U.S. tariffs (most of the increases are in the range of 10-25%), and have resulted in retaliation of a similar magnitude by some of the countries whose exports to the United States have been subject to the tariff increases; they affect approximately 12% of annual U.S. imports and 8% of U.S. exports, magnitudes that could grow if additional proposed or pending actions are carried out, or decrease if additional negotiated solutions are achieved; they represent a significant shift from recent U.S. trade policy as no President has imposed tariffs under these authorities in nearly two decades; and they have potentially significant implications for U.S. economic activity, the U.S. role in the global trading system, and future U.S. trade negotiations.
China is a major focus of a Section 301 investigation and related tariff measures largely due to concerns over its intellectual property rights (IPR) and forced technology transfer practices, and the size of its bilateral trade deficit with the United States.
Described by the White House as a response to China's ""economic aggression,"" the memorandum identified four broad Chinese IP-related policies to justify U.S. action under Section 301, stating China uses joint venture requirements, foreign investment restrictions, and administrative review and licensing processes to force or pressure technology transfers from American companies; China uses discriminatory licensing processes to transfer technologies from U.S. companies to Chinese companies; China directs and facilitates investments and acquisitions, which generate large-scale technology transfer; and China conducts and supports cyber intrusions into U.S. computer networks to gain access to valuable business information.
Some observers also raise concerns over the scale of the Administration's actions, which have led to import restrictions imposed on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including some close allies such as Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the EU.
These goods are among the top U.S. imports supplied by a number of U.S. trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and the EU, making an increase in U.S. tariffs that applies to these countries economically significant and likely to result in retaliatory action.
As noted, President Trump has warned that he will follow through with his threat to increase Section 301 tariffs on $200 billion worth of products from China from 10% to 25% if a trade agreement is not reached by March 1, 2019, or potentially soon thereafter.
The potential Section 232 actions on motor vehicles and uranium could cover an additional $361 billion and $2 billion, respectively in U.S. imports, depending on the countries and products included.
Retaliatory tariffs imposed by China in response to U.S. Section 301 actions affect approximately $101 billion of U.S. annual exports, accounting for about 80% of U.S. exports subject to retaliatory tariffs currently in effect ( Figure 6 ).
The United States has placed increased tariffs on products accounting for approximately $282 billion of annual U.S. imports, while retaliatory tariffs cover approximately $126 billion of annual U.S. exports, using 2017 trade values.
As a share of overall U.S. trade, approximately 12% of annual U.S. goods imports ($282 billion of $2,342 billion total imports) are subject to increased U.S. tariffs under the Trump Administration's actions ( Figure 8 ).
Retaliatory tariffs are explicitly targeted to encourage the United States to remove its Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs, whereas the Trump Administration's enacted and proposed tariffs aim both to alter U.S. trading partners' practices more broadly, including reducing existing tariff and nontariff barriers, and to protect domestic industries.
Some factors that may create greater pressure for U.S. policy change include (1) demand for the targeted product is price sensitive (i.e., demand is price elastic), therefore a small tariff increase will lead to a sharper decline in exports; (2) the retaliating country is a major world market for the product, in which case the exports may not be easily diverted to other markets; and (3) the producers of the targeted products in the United States (i.e., those negatively affected by the tariffs) have high levels of political influence (e.g., the product is made in congressional districts with Members on key committees).
In response, the USTR created a product exclusion process, whereby firms could petition for an exemption from the Section 301 tariff increases for specific imports.
The Members' letter included specific recommendations, such as allowing for broader product ranges to be included in a single request, allowing trade associations to petition, grandfathering existing contracts to avoid disruptions, and regularly reviewing the tariffs' effects and sunsetting them if they have a ""significant negative impact."" In September 2018, during an oversight hearing, multiple Senators raised concerns directly to the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security at Commerce, about agency management of the Section 232 exclusion process, including staffing and funding levels, and the need for greater transparency, among other issues.
The extent of the price change and its impact on trade flows, employment, and production in the United States and abroad depend on resource constraints and how various economic actors (foreign producers of the goods subject to the tariffs, producers of domestic substitutes, producers in downstream industries, and consumers) respond as the effects of the increased tariffs reverberate throughout the economy.
On July 16, 2018, the United States filed its own WTO complaints over the retaliatory tariffs imposed by five countries (Canada, China, the EU, Mexico, and Turkey) in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports under Section 232."
161,"While the substantial business avenue appears to have been largely eliminated by Treasury regulations that increased the required share of activity, the option of merging with a smaller foreign company remains.
This treatment occurred because U.S. corporations could defer U.S. tax on active income earned abroad in foreign subsidiaries until it was paid, or repatriated, to the U.S. parent company as a dividend.
The new system also allows U.S. firms a deduction for foreign derived intangible income, or FDII, which was designed to reduce tax rates on foreign earnings from the use of intangible assets held in the United States.
Income from certain foreign sources earned by subsidiaries—which generally includes passive types of income, such as interest, dividends, annuities, rents, and royalties, and is referred to as Subpart F income—is generally taxed in the year it is earned and was retained by the Act. Subpart F applies only to shareholders who may be able to influence location decisions at the corporate level.
Response to Initial Inversions: The American Jobs Creation Act In the late 1990s and early 2000s, news reports drew the attention of policymakers and the public to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate ""inversions"" or ""expatriations"": instances where firms that consist of multiple corporations reorganize their structure so that the ""parent"" element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the United States.
Post-2004 Inversions and Treasury Regulations of 2012 Although the 2004 act largely eliminated the generic naked inversions, two alternatives remained that allowed a firm to shift headquarters and retain control of the business: the naked inversion via the business activity exemption, and merger with a smaller company.
Eaton's move abroad was a merger; it merged with Coopers, a firm effectively operating its headquarters in the United States, but one that had inverted prior to the 2004 law change.
The regulations do not prevent inversions via merger and do not address earnings stripping by shifting debt to the U.S. firm, although Treasury has indicated future action in this area.
If a majority of stock is obtained, the U.S. firm's subsidiary is no longer a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) and not subject to Subpart F, which taxes currently certain passive or easily shifted income.
Addressing Techniques to Achieve Less Than 80% Ownership Requirement A firm can realize the tax benefits of an inversion only if the shareholders of the original U.S. firm retain, after the merger, less than 80% of the ownership in the new company.
Treasury Regulations, April 4, 2016 On April 4, 2016, the Treasury Department issued temporary and proposed regulations formalizing rules contained in Notices 2014-52 and 2015-79 limiting corporate tax inversions, as well as adding new rules addressing inversions and earnings-stripping transactions.
Asset Dilution Rule A third rule modified existing regulations to restrict the ability of inverted companies to avoid paying tax on unrealized gains (under Section 965) through a transfer to a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) (under Section 351).
Inversions After the April 4, 2016, Treasury Regulations Two days after the regulations were issued, Pfizer withdrew from its merger with Allergen, an Irish-based company that was an inverted firm.
250 (Sanders), would have eliminated deferral (taxing foreign source income currently), in addition to limiting the benefits of inversions when management and control continues to reside in the United States.
Legislative proposals were also under discussion in 2014 by Representative Levin (announced July 31, 2014) and by Senator Schumer (announced August 14, 2014) to address earnings stripping, where foreign parent companies borrow from the U.S. subsidiary to increase interest deductions and reduce taxable income in the United States."
162,"Data Sources  The analysis presented in this report relies on two data sources: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC).
The NPSAS data are used in this report to explore the income characteristics of the postsecondary population and the extent to which income is related to other student demographics, such as race and dependency status.
To draw valid comparisons between the national and the postsecondary population groups, CRS created an income variable in CPS ASEC that closely resembles the NPSAS variable for income as a percentage of the poverty guidelines.
This section of the report explores changes in the income distribution of students enrolled in postsecondary education over time using the NPSAS variable for income as a percentage of the poverty guidelines.
Figure 3 illustrates dependency status of enrolled undergraduate students by poverty bands in AY2015-2016 and suggests that independent students constituted a large portion of this population.
Income Distribution of the National Population and the Undergraduate Population The NPSAS data suggest that low-income students have enrolled in postsecondary education at higher levels in more recent years.
Summary of Selected Data Findings Since the last reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the number and proportion of low-income undergraduate students (defined in this report as students with income below 200% of the poverty guidelines) has increased, even as total enrollment has decreased in more recent years."
163,"The program has a significant impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders as well as on the economy in general through its coverage of important health care benefits for the aged and disabled, the payment of premiums and other cost sharing by those beneficiaries, its payments to providers who supply those health care services, and its interaction with other insurance coverage.
P.L. 92-603, enacted in 1972, expanded program coverage to certain individuals under 65 (the disabled and persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)), and introduced managed care into Medicare by allowing private insurance entities to provide Medicare benefits in exchange for a monthly capitated payment.
During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of laws were enacted that included provisions designed to further stem the rapid increase in program spending through modifications to the way payments to providers were determined, and to postpone the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund.
The MMA included provisions that (1) created a new voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit to be administered by private entities; (2) replaced the Medicare+Choice program with the Medicare Advantage (MA) program and raised payments to plans in order to increase their availability for beneficiaries; (3) introduced the concept of income testing into Medicare, with higher-income persons paying larger Part B premiums beginning in 2007; (4) modified some provider payment rules; (5) expanded covered preventive services; and (6) created a specific process for overall program review if general revenue spending exceeded a specified threshold.
Included in the ACA, as amended, are provisions that (1) constrain Medicare's annual payment increases for certain providers; (2) change payment rates in the MA program so that they more closely resemble those in fee-for-service; (3) reduce payments to hospitals that serve a large number of low-income patients; (4) create an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make recommendations to adjust Medicare payment rates; (5) phase out the Part D prescription drug benefit ""doughnut hole""; (6) increase resources and enhance activities to prevent fraud and abuse; and (7) provide incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, such as creating value-based purchasing programs for certain types of providers, allowing accountable care organizations (ACOs) that meet certain quality and efficiency standards to share in the savings, creating a voluntary pilot program that bundles payments for physician, hospital, and post-acute care services, and adjusting payments to hospitals for readmissions related to certain potentially preventable conditions.
Additionally, MACRA reduced updates to hospital and post-acute care provider payments, extended several expiring provider payment adjustments, made adjustments to income-related premiums in Parts B and D, and prohibited using Social Security numbers on beneficiaries' Medicare cards.
For example, BBA 18 included provisions designed to expand care for beneficiaries with chronic health conditions, such as promoting team-based care by providers, increasing the use of telehealth services, and expanding certain MA supplemental benefits.
In addition, BBA 18 extended for five years a number of existing Medicare provisions that were set to expire (or that had temporarily expired), including the Medicare dependent hospital program and add-on payments for low-volume hospitals, rural home health services, and certain ambulance services.
Starting in 2019, the act will require that pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicare Part D provide a larger discount on brand-name drugs purchased by enrollees in the coverage gap and will create a new high-income premium category under Parts B and D.
Eligibility and Enrollment Most persons aged 65 or older are automatically entitled to premium-free Part A because they or their spouse paid Medicare payroll taxes for at least 40 quarters (about 10 years) on earnings covered by either the Social Security or the Railroad Retirement systems.
In addition, disabled persons who lose their cash benefits solely because of higher earnings, and subsequently lose their extended Medicare coverage, may continue their Medicare enrollment by paying a premium, subject to limitations.
(Physicians' services provided during an inpatient stay are paid under the physician fee schedule and discussed below in the "" Physicians and Nonphysician Practitioner Services "" section.) Coverage for inpatient services is linked to an individual's benefit period or ""spell of illness"" (defined as beginning on the day a patient enters a hospital and ending when he or she has not been in a hospital or skilled nursing facility for 60 days).
In addition, Medicare pays hospitals for 65% of the allowable costs associated with beneficiaries' unpaid deductible and co-payment amounts as well as for the costs for certain other services.
The physician agrees to accept assignment on all Medicare claims in a given year and is referred to as a ""participating physician."" There are several advantages to being a participating provider, including higher payment under the Medicare fee schedule, a lower beneficiary co-payment, and automatic forwarding of Medigap claims.
MACRA made several fundamental changes to how Medicare pays for physician and practitioner services by (1) changing the methodology for determining the annual updates to the conversion factor, (2) establishing a merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) to consolidate and replace several existing incentive programs and to apply value and quality adjustments to the MPFS, and (3) establishing the development of, and participation in, alternative payment models (APMs).
Under MA, private health plans are paid a per-person amount to provide all Medicare covered benefits (except hospice) to beneficiaries who enroll in their plan.
Medicare expenditures are primarily paid for through mandatory spending—generally Medicare pays for all covered health care services provided to beneficiaries.
(See Appendix B for 2019 Part B premiums and high-income thresholds.) Part C Financing Payments for spending under the Medicare Advantage program are made in appropriate portions from the HI and SMI trust funds.
Additional Insurance Coverage While Medicare provides broad protection against the costs of many, primarily acute care, services, the program does not cover all services that may be used by its aged and disabled beneficiaries.
Further, unlike most private insurance policies, it does not include an annual ""catastrophic"" cap on out-of-pocket spending on cost-sharing charges for services covered under Parts A and B (except for persons enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans)."
164,"The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 ( P.L. 102-325 ) limited the eligibility of incarcerated students to HEA Title IV aid in several ways: Individuals who were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and those who were sentenced to death were prohibited from receiving a Pell Grant.
The report provided data on the number of inmates receiving Pell Grants, described the effect of allowing incarcerated individuals to receive Pell Grants on grants for other needy students, and reviewed the research at that time on the effect of correctional education on recidivism rates.
As a likely consequence of the newly enacted prohibition on prisoners receiving Pell Grants, combined with previously enacted prohibitions on the receipt of HEA Title IV student loans, the availability of postsecondary education programs to state prisoners and their enrollment in such programs declined.
Current Pell Grant Eligibility  Under Department of Education (ED) regulations for HEA Title IV, an incarcerated student is defined as any ""student who is serving a criminal sentence in a federal, state, or local penitentiary, prison, jail, reformatory, work farm, or other similar correctional institution."" The definition does not include an individual who is confined in a correctional facility prior to the imposition of any criminal sentence or juvenile disposition, such as an individual confined in a local jail while awaiting trial.
Specific eligibility requirements for the Pell Grant program that may be germane to criminal justice involved individuals include, but are not limited to, the following: Students must not be incarcerated in a federal or state penal institution.
In promoting the experiment, ED highlighted research finding that making postsecondary education and training opportunities available to incarcerated individuals increases educational attainment, reduces recidivism, and improves post-release employment opportunities and earnings.
However, there are several issues policymakers might consider before expanding access to Pell Grants, including overall program costs, whether the federal government should support more research on the effects of postsecondary education in correctional institutions, obstacles to providing access to postsecondary education in a correctional environment, and barriers returning prisoners might face when trying to find post-release employment related to their education.
The increase in program costs that would result from making federal and state prisoners eligible for Pell Grants who are currently ineligible would be limited by several provisions under current law: Students must have a high school diploma (or equivalent) or be enrolled in an eligible career pathway program that leads to high school completion and postsecondary credential attainment.
Should Congress want to take additional steps to promote postsecondary educational pursuits of incarcerated individuals, it might consider encouraging the development of career pathway programs in correctional environments such that prisoners who have not completed high school may pursue postsecondary education with the aid of a Pell Grant."
165,"The provision in the 2018 farm bill is similar to the original version of CREP in that it authorizes USDA to enter into agreements with states to target designated project areas with continuous CRP enrollment contracts.
Projects are designed to address specific environmental objectives through targeted continuous, noncompetitive, CRP enrollment that typically provides additional financial incentives beyond annual rental payments and cost-share assistance.
Other CRP Initiatives CLEAR 30 The 2018 farm bill creates a new pilot program referred to as CLEAR 30, which enrolls expiring CRP land into 30-year contracts devoted to practices that improve water quality.
Soil Health and Income Protection Pilot (SHIPP)  The 2018 farm bill also creates a new SHIPP pilot program under CRP to remove less productive farm land from production in exchange for annual rental payments and to plant low-cost perennial cover crops.
The new EQIP incentive contracts exhibit some similarities with CSP contracts, including addressing priority resource concerns; and providing annual payments for adopting, maintaining, and improving practices.
The EQIP incentive contracts also include notable differences from CSP, including a no stewardship threshold for entry; no comprehensive requirement for addressing resource concerns; no whole-farm enrollment; and no limit on payments.
CSP Grassland Conservation Initiative Amendments under the commodities title (Title I) of the 2018 farm bill changed how base acres are used to calculate eligibility for certain commodity support programs.
Conservation Compliance Two farm bill provisions require that in exchange for certain USDA program benefits, a producer agrees to maintain a minimum level of conservation on highly erodible land and not to convert wetlands to crop production."
166,"Section 24 of the NBA grants national banks a number of powers, including: (1) ""discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt,"" (2) ""receiving deposits,"" (3) ""buying and selling exchange, coin, and bullion,"" (4) ""loaning money on personal security,"" and (5) ""obtaining, issuing, and circulating notes."" Section 24 also grants national banks ""all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking."" Federal court and OCC decisions have identified roughly 80 activities that fall within the ""incidental powers"" of national banks, including the ability to broker annuities charge customers non-interest fees.
similar approval."" The Court inferred this purpose from the principle that ""normally Congress would not want States to forbid, or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly granted.""  Lower courts have followed Barnett Bank 's rule that absent indications to the contrary, federal statutes and regulations that grant national banks the power to engage in specific activities preempt state laws that prohibit or ""significantly interfere"" with those activities.
While federal courts have accordingly adopted expansive views of the circumstances in which state laws ""significantly interfere"" with national banks' powers, they have also recognized certain general limits on the preemptive scope of federal banking statutes and regulations.
Specifically, the court reasoned that these claims survived preemption because they were based on ""a non-discriminating state law of general applicability that does not conflict with federal law, frustrate the purposes of the [NBA], or impair the efficiency of national banks to discharge their duties."" In reaching this conclusion, the court rejected the argument that federal law preempted the customers' fraud claims because those claims ""necessarily touche[d] on"" national banks' authority to provide checking accounts.
The OCC's 2004 preemption rules articulated a general preemption standard according to which ""state laws that obstruct, impair, or condition a national bank's ability to fully exercise"" its federally authorized powers ""are not applicable to national banks"" except ""where made applicable by Federal law."" This general standard accordingly expanded on Barnett Bank 's ""significant interference"" test in two ways.
Second, Section 1044 provides that no OCC preemption determination ""shall be interpreted or applied so as to invalidate, or otherwise declare inapplicable to a national bank, the provision of the State consumer financial law, unless substantial evidence, made on the record of the proceeding, supports the specific finding regarding the preemption of such provision in accordance with the legal standard"" established by Barnett Bank .
Finally, Section 1044 abrogated the Supreme Court's decision in Watters , providing that ""State consumer financial laws"" apply to the subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks ""to the same extent"" that they apply ""to any person, corporation, or other entity subject to such State law."" The OCC's 2011 Preemption Rules After Dodd-Frank's enactment, commentators debated the meaning of Section 1044's general preemption standard.
As discussed, Section 1044's preemption standard provides that federal law preempts ""State consumer financial laws"" that ""prevent[] or significantly interfere[]"" with the powers of national banks ""in accordance with the legal standard for preemption in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in [ Barnett Bank ]."" Some commentators have argued that this language simply codifies the Barnett Bank standard and was not intended to significantly modify pre-existing law.
However, others have argued that Section 1044 was intended to pare back the OCC's 2004 preemption rules, which interpreted the NBA as preempting state laws that ""obstruct, impair, or condition"" the powers of national banks."
167,"They include the Bureau of Land Management, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, Land and Water Conservation Fund, National Park Service, Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program, Smithsonian Institution, U.S. Geological Survey, and Wildland Fire Management.
For the selected agencies and programs, the discussions below briefly compare FY2018 regular annual funding with FY2019 levels requested by the Administration, approved by the House in H.R. 6147 (115 th Congress), approved by the Senate in H.R. 6147 (115 th Congress), and enacted for FY2019 in Division E of P.L. 116-6 .
The House and Senate versions of the bill included increased appropriations for BLM for FY2019, of 4.1% and 0.9% respectively, with additional funds for the Management of Lands and Resources.
Relative to the FY2018 appropriations in Title II only ($8.06 billion), the EPA would have received a decrease under the Administration's request (23.2%) and under the House-passed bill (1.6%), but it would have received level funding under the Senate-passed bill.
However, whereas the Senate would have provided level funding for many accounts, the House more often supported decreases (e.g., Science and Technology, and Environmental Programs and Management) or increases (e.g., Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Program, and Hazardous Substance Superfund).
Like the House-passed and Senate-passed bills, the FY2019 appropriation increased funding for Resource Management, and retained funding for the cooperative landscape conservation and science support programs funded by this account.
Similar to the House-passed and Senate-passed bills, the FY2019 enacted appropriation did not fund the Special Diabetes Program for Indians through discretionary appropriations, and provided level funding for most Indian Health Facilities programs except for facilities and environmental health support, which received an increase.
Smithsonian Institution For FY2019, the Smithsonian Institution (SI) would have received a decrease (8.2%) under the Administration's request, an increase (1.2%) under the House-passed bill, and essentially level funding under the Senate-passed bill as compared with the FY2018 appropriation ($1.04 billion).
U.S. Geological Survey Relative to FY2018 appropriations ($1.15 billion), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) would have received a decrease (25.1%) under the Administration's request, an increase (2.1%) under the House-passed bill, and level funding under the Senate-passed bill."
168,"Introduction This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) program.
The SSNs are general-purpose submarines that can (when appropriately equipped and armed) perform a variety of peacetime and wartime missions, including the following: covert intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), much of it done for national-level (as opposed to purely Navy) purposes; covert insertion and recovery of SOF (on a smaller scale than possible with the SSGNs); covert strikes against land targets with the Tomahawk cruise missiles (again on a smaller scale than possible with the SSGNs); covert offensive and defensive mine warfare; anti-submarine warfare (ASW); and anti-surface ship warfare.
Due to the shift in the strategic environment in recent years from the post-Cold War era to a new situation featuring renewed great power competition, ASW against Russian and Chinese submarines has once again become a more prominent mission for U.S. Navy SSNs. U.S. Attack Submarine Force Levels Force-Level Goal The Navy's force-level goal, released in December 2016, is to achieve and maintain a 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. For a review of SSN force-level goals since the Reagan Administration, see Appendix A .
(The Navy calculated that the unit target cost of $2.0 billion in constant FY2005 dollars for each submarine translated into about $2.6 billion for a boat procured in FY2012.) Schedule and Cost Performance on Deliveries Earlier Record As noted in CRS testimony in 2014, the Virginia (SSN-774) class attack program has been cited as an example of a successful acquisition program.
The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the remaining $7,155.9 million in procurement funding needed to complete the boats' estimated combined procurement cost, as well as $1,887.6 million in ""regular"" AP funding for Virginia-class boats to be procured in future fiscal years and $882.0 million in additional EOQ AP funding for components of boats to be procured under the FY2019-FY2023 MYP contract, bringing the total amount of procurement and AP funding requested for the program in FY2020 to $9,925.5 million (i.e., about $9.9 billion), excluding outfitting and post-delivery costs.
A November 2018 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the issue stated: The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures.
The root cause of submarine idle time and associated loss of operational availability, as discussed in the recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report 19-229, ""Actions Needed to Address Costly Maintenance Delays Facing the Attack Submarine Fleet"" (issued November 2018), is largely due to public shipyard capacity not keeping pace with growing maintenance requirements that have been building for a number of years prior to the USS BOISE (SSN 764) FY 2016 Engineered Overhaul (EOH).
If, in addition to reducing Virginia-class shipyard construction time to 60 months, the Navy also lengthens the service lives of 16 existing SSNs by periods ranging from 3 months to 24 months (with many falling in the range of 9 to 15 months), this would increase the size of the SSN force by another two boats, so that the force would bottom out at 44 boats rather than 40 boats."
169,"The prosecutors alleged that by facilitating the exchange of virtual currencies (including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ether) for illegal narcotics and other illicit goods and services, the site's creator had conspired to conduct ""financial transactions"" involving the proceeds of unlawful activities.
In adjudicating the second category of charges, courts have concluded that the relevant virtual currency payment systems were ""unlicensed money transmitting businesses"" under Section 1960, rejecting the argument that the provision applies only to money transmitters that facilitate cash transactions.
In charging the defendants for failing to register their business, prosecutors alleged that e-Gold operated as an ""unlicensed money transmitting business"" in each of the three ways identified by Section 1960—the provision criminalizing the operation of ""unlicensed money transmitting businesses."" Specifically, the prosecutors alleged that e-Gold (1) lacked a required state money transmitter license, (2) failed to comply with the BSA's federal registration requirements for ""money transmitting businesses"" (requirements set forth in Section 5330 of Title 31), and (3) was involved in the transmission of funds that were ""known to have been derived from a criminal offense"" or that were ""intended to be used to promote and support unlawful activity."" In defending these charges, the defendants presented an intricate argument for the proposition that Section 1960 applies only to businesses that facilitate cash (as opposed to virtual currency) transactions."

171,"Members have considered legislative proposals seeking to reduce Yemeni civilian casualties resulting from the coalition's operations; improve deteriorating humanitarian conditions; end restrictions on the flow of goods and humanitarian aid; combat Iranian support for the Houthis; preserve maritime security in the Bab al Mandab Strait; and/or support continued Saudi-led coalition and U.S. efforts to counter Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen.
In October 2015, 10 Members of Congress wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to ""work with our Saudi partners to limit civilian casualties to the fullest extent possible."" In October 2015, Senator Markey stated that ""I fear that our failure to strongly advocate diplomacy in Yemen over the past two years, coupled with our failure to urge restraint in the face of the crisis last spring, may put the viability of this critical [U.S.-Saudi] partnership at risk.""  By the fall of 2015, as the Obama Administration tried to balance its concern for adhering to the laws of armed conflict with its support for Gulf partners, lawmakers began to express their concern over U.S. involvement in the coalition's intervention by scrutinizing U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
In his first year in office, while President Trump sought to improve relations with Saudi Arabia, counter Iran, and increase U.S. counterterrorism activity in Yemen, his Administration also at times took strong positions on the need for members of the coalition to improve humanitarian access, pursue a settlement to the conflict, and take measures to prevent civilian casualties.
The next day, the White House issued a statement welcoming ""Saudi Arabia's announcement of these humanitarian actions in the face of this major conflict."" 2018 As the Saudi-led coalition intervention entered its fourth year, some in the Senate also proposed use of the War Powers Resolution as a tool for ending U.S. support for the coalition's military intervention.
In February 2018, the Acting Department of Defense General Counsel wrote to Senate leaders describing the extent of current U.S. support , and reported that ""the United States provides the KSA-led coalition defense articles and services, including air-to-air refueling; certain intelligence support; and military advice, including advice regarding compliance with the law of armed conflict and best practices for reducing the risk of civilian casualties.""  On March 20, 2018, the Senate considered S.J.Res. 54 on the floor."
172,"Overview of Unemployment Insurance Programs In general, when eligible workers lose their jobs, the joint federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program may provide up to 26 weeks of income support through regular UC benefit payments.
The 0.6% effective net FUTA tax paid by employers on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings (equaling no more than $42 per worker per year) funds federal and state administrative costs, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, the federal share (50%) of EB payments, and state employment services.
However, according to guidance from U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), excepted federal employees who are performing services (but working without pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of ""unemployment."" Private-sector workers who are furloughed or laid off due to the partial government shutdown because they were employed by government contractors or other businesses may be eligible for regular UC benefits.
For example, as described below in the section on "" Unemployment Compensation for Excepted Federal Employees During a Government Shutdown ,"" there are proposals to provide new authority to pay UCFE benefits to excepted federal workers who are working without pay.
This proposal would amend UCFE law and create a new permanent UCFE eligibility category for excepted federal employees who are unpaid but required to work during a government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations."
173,"Introduction A variety of issues related to housing were active during the 115 th Congress, including issues related to housing finance, housing-related tax provisions, housing assistance and grant programs (including in response to presidentially declared major disasters), and actions undertaken by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as part of its efforts to review existing department regulations.
This report provides a high-level overview of the most prominent housing-related issues during the Congress, including brief background on each and discussion of legislative or other relevant activity.
Despite concerns about the affordability of owner-occupied housing, many metrics suggest that homeownership is currently relatively affordable by historical standards; however, such measures generally focus on the ability of households to afford monthly mortgage payments and do not consider other costs of purchasing a home, such as saving for a down payment.
Owner-Occupied Housing Markets and the Mortgage Market Over the past few years, on a national level, markets for owner-occupied housing have generally been characterized by rising home prices, low inventory levels, housing starts that are increasing but remain relatively low by historical standards, and home buying activity that is beginning to return to pre-crisis levels.
Therefore, rising incomes and, especially, interest rates that are still low by historical standards contribute to homes, and borrowers' monthly mortgage payments in particular, being considered affordable despite recent house price increases.
Others have argued that mortgage credit standards are easing too much, focusing on the fact that credit standards for certain types of mortgages, such as those insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), have appeared to loosen somewhat in recent years compared to the immediate aftermath of the housing market turmoil when standards tightened across the board.
The share of new mortgage originations, by dollar volume, insured by a federal agency or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac has fallen from a high of nearly 90% in 2009, during the housing market turmoil.
Although new rental housing units have also been created, both through new construction and as some formerly owner-occupied homes are converted to rentals, in many markets the rise in the number of renters increased competition for rental housing, leading to lower rental vacancy rates and higher rents in recent years.
Provisions of the act that modify mortgage-related requirements that were put in place after the housing market turmoil include the following:  allowing certain mortgages originated and held in portfolio by small depository institutions to be considered ""qualified mortgages"" for the purposes of complying with the ability-to-repay rule; making changes to requirements related to certain property appraisals; exempting some banks and credit unions that make fewer than a particular number of mortgage loans from specified new reporting requirements under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA); providing grace periods for individuals working as mortgage originators to obtain the proper licensing to originate mortgages in their new positions when they move from banks to nonbanks or across state lines; expanding the circumstances under which manufactured home retailers and their employees can be excluded from the definition of mortgage originators, and therefore exempt from certain requirements that apply to mortgage originators, subject to specified conditions; and waiving the waiting period between receipt of particular mortgage-related disclosures and the mortgage closing when a borrower is offered a lower interest rate after initial receipt of the disclosures.
These include the following: requirements intended to address concerns about certain refinancing practices related to some mortgages guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs; making permanent specified protections for renters in foreclosed properties that had been put in place by the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (Title VII of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, P.L. 111-22 ) in 2009 but had since expired; making permanent a one-year protection against foreclosure for active duty servicemembers under particular circumstances; requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider alternative credit scoring models for mortgages purchased by those institutions; making Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loans, which allow some homeowners to finance specified energy improvements through property tax assessments, subject to the ability-to-repay requirements that apply to most mortgages; certain changes related to small public housing agencies; changes to HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency program, an asset-building program for residents of public and assisted housing; and requiring certain reports, including a report by HUD on lead paint hazards and abatement and a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on foreclosures in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
These included (1) an FHFA decision to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to each retain $3 billion in capital (under the terms of the Treasury support agreements, the amount of capital they are allowed to retain was scheduled to fall to zero at the beginning of 2018), (2) the need for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to draw on their lines of credit with Treasury in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to a reduction in the value of deferred tax assets as a result of the tax revision law passed in late 2017, and (3) FHFA directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to continue to make required contributions to certain affordable housing funds despite the draw from Treasury.
FHA raised the premiums it charges several times in the years during and following the housing market turmoil in response to concerns about rising mortgage delinquency rates and FHA's ability to maintain compliance with the capital ratio requirement.
While most of the provisions of HOTMA affected HUD rental assistance programs, there were four provisions related to FHA's requirements for insuring mortgages on condominium units.
These provisions directed the HUD Secretary to (1) streamline the recertification process for FHA approval of condominium buildings to make it less burdensome, (2) make changes to the process for granting exceptions for exceeding FHA's limits on commercial space, (3) adopt Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regulations related to transfer fees and condominiums, and (4) issue new guidance, and a justification, addressing the required percentage of owner-occupied units in the building.
The increase in tax credits included in P.L. 115-141 may help to alleviate concerns about the potential impact of the tax revision law on the price for LIHTCs. A dditional information: For more information on the low-income housing tax credit in general, and these recent changes to the program, see CRS Report RS22389, An Introduction to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit .
This legislation was not enacted before the end of the 115 th Congress.H.R. 2069 , the Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities Act of 2017, ordered to be reported by the House Financial Services Committee in July 2018 (on a vote of 34-23), would have created a new federal preference for youth aging out of foster care and at risk of homelessness across most federal housing assistance programs and required that youth accessing assistance via the preference be subject to education, training, or work requirements as set by local program administrators.
This legislation was not enacted before the end of the 115 th Congress.H.R. 1511 , the Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2017, ordered to be reported by the House Financial Services Committee in July 2018 (on a vote of 39-18), would have expanded the definition of homelessness governing the HUD homeless programs, while maintaining existing resources for the programs, to include homeless families with children and youth certified as homeless under other federal programs that have less-restrictive definitions.
It would have authorized new funding for affordable housing programs and activities at a level greater than HUD's entire budget, with both supply-side and demand-side investments, among other changes.
Recent Developments In June 2016, during the 114 th Congress, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register proposing to require certain PHAs to use SAFMRs in the administration of their HCV programs if they had high levels of vouchers concentrated in high-poverty areas."
174,"For example, ED receives both mandatory and discretionary appropriations; ED is annually provided forward funds and advance appropriations for some—but not all—discretionary programs; ED awards both formula and competitive grants; and a portion of ED's budget subsidizes student loan costs (through both direct loans and loan guarantees).
That is, ED had legal authority to spend up to $16.805 billion in federal funds for the purposes associated with this account (which consists primarily of grants allocated to local educational agencies).
Authorizations and Appropriations The congressional budget process generally distinguishes between two types of measures— authorizations , which create or modify federal government programs or activities, and appropriations , which fund those activities.
Appropriations measures, on the other hand, are typically enacted annually and provide new budget authority for agencies, programs, policies, and activities that are already authorized and are under the jurisdiction of the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee.
For example, P.L. 115-245 provided budget authority that was available for one year for ED's Indian Education account, a year-and-a-quarter for Special Education, and two years for Impact Aid. In general, during a calendar year Congress may consider the following: 12 regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that begins on October 1 (often referred to as the budget year) to provide the annual funding for the agencies, projects, and activities funded therein; one or more continuing resolutions for that same fiscal year, to provide temporary funding if all 12 regular appropriations bills are not enacted by the start of the fiscal year; and one or more supplemental appropriations measures for the current fiscal year, to provide additional funding for selected activities over and above the amount provided through annual or continuing appropriations.
For example, Section 1002 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended and reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, P.L. 114-95 ), includes an authorization of appropriations provision effectively recommending a specific funding level ($15.9 billion) for the Title I-A program in a certain fiscal year (FY2019).
First, authorizing legislation becomes law that sets program parameters (through eligibility requirements and benefit levels, for example), then the appropriations process is used to provide the budget authority needed to finance the commitment.
(This type of budget authority is referred to as ""advance appropriations"" and is discussed further in the section "" ""Carry Forward,"" Advance Appropriations, and Forward Funding ."") Fiscal Year, Award Year, and Other Units of Time Department of Education budget, appropriations, and program-related data may be reported using a variety of different ""years"" or units of time.
For example, ED's FY2019 congressional budget justification includes both fiscal year and award year funding levels for the Pell Grant program.
With advance appropriations and forward funding, the budget authority becomes available for obligation at a point in time that is delayed beyond the start of the fiscal year.
For example, in FY2019 the appropriations act that funded ED provided that up to 1% of any discretionary budget authority appropriated to the department could be transferred between accounts, subject to certain restrictions.
In short, the answer depends on what federal accounts or activities are defined as ""education spending,"" on the point in the fiscal year when budget authority is estimated, and which federal agency is reporting."
175,"Congress principally has directed either the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) in the Department of the Interior (DOI) or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in the Department of Defense to plan and construct the existing stock of large federal water resource projects.
In addition, Congress authorizes and funds selected water resource science and monitoring activities at multiple federal agencies.
The report next covers the following crosscutting topics: funding and financing aging and new water resource projects, changing from federal infrastructure projects to federal partnerships, protecting and restoring the environment, flood resilience and natural and nature-based infrastructure, and recharging groundwater.
Some USACE-related issues that the 116 th Congress may address include the following: Funding and financing issues, such as the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, investments in projects to deepen coastal harbors, USACE budgeting priorities, and oversight of USACE efforts to implement public-private partnerships and to develop alternative financing opportunities.
Such issues may include, for example, the status of new and proposed water storage projects; dam safety issues at existing federal reclamation projects; and efforts to address the agency's aging infrastructure and transition projects to nonfederal ownership.
In addition, Congress may address drought mitigation assistance, planning, and preparedness through oversight hearings and legislation (e.g., Energy and Water Development appropriations), especially if dry conditions persist or intensify in the Colorado River basin and in other western states.
The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) is an international agreement between the United States and Canada for the cooperative development and operation of the water resources of the Columbia River basin to provide for flood control and power.
Protecting and Restoring the Environment The 116 th Congress may engage in discussions of how threatened and endangered species designations and related critical habitat and environmental mitigation requirements affect water resource project construction and operations.
Under the WIIN Act, Congress provided general authority for Reclamation to support new and enhanced federal and state surface and groundwater storage projects under certain, limited circumstances."
176,"Across these decades, the breadth of policy areas addressed through such farm bills has expanded beyond providing support for a limited number of agricultural commodities to include establishing programs and policies that address a broad spectrum of related areas.
The enacted 2018 farm bill continues a tradition of multi-year farm bills that would establish policy for a broad array of agriculture and nutrition assistance programs.
These titles cover commodity support programs, agricultural conservation, trade and international food aid, domestic nutrition assistance, credit, rural development, research and extension, forestry, horticulture, crop insurance, and a variety of other policies and initiatives.
Title I also includes several administrative provisions that suspend permanent farm law from 1938 and 1949 that would otherwise impose antiquated and potentially disruptive price support programs; assign payment limits for individuals, joint ventures or partnerships, and corporations; specify the adjusted gross income (AGI) threshold for program payment eligibility; and identify other details regarding payment attribution and eligibility.
The 2018 farm bill expands these SNAP incentive programs, increasing mandatory funding, and, within FINI's funding, establishes grants for produce prescription projects to serve individuals eligible for SNAP or Medicaid in households with or at risk of developing a diet-related health condition.
The law adds a new section to the Rural Development Act of 1972 authorizing the Secretary to temporarily prioritize assistance under certain USDA Rural Development loan and grant programs to respond to a public health emergency.
The new law amends the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program to authorize $10 million per year in discretionary funding for FY2019-FY2023 and $5 million per year in mandatory funding for FY2022-FY2023.
Research22 USDA is authorized under four major laws to conduct agricultural research at the federal level and to provide support for cooperative research, extension, and postsecondary agricultural education programs in the states through formula funds and competitive grants to land-grant universities (see Table 11 ).
The law also reauthorizes the Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative (OREI) and increases mandatory funding levels to $30 million annually for FY2019-FY2023.
The enacted law provides new programs for the 1890 land-grant institutions and 1994 tribal colleges of agriculture, authorizes new support for urban and indoor agricultural production, authorizes new funding for industrial hemp research and development, and authorizes an initiative supporting advanced agricultural research.
A new provision creates a ""Hemp Production"" subtitle under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, expanding the existing statutory definition of hemp and expanding eligibility to other producers and groups, including tribes and territories.
Forestry23 Similar to previous farm bills, the forestry title in the enacted 2018 farm bill ( P.L. 115-334 , Title VIII) includes provisions related to forestry research and establishes, modifies, or repeals several programs to provide financial and technical assistance to nonfederal forest landowners (see Table 12 ).
The House-passed version would have established 10 other categorical exclusions for various activities and would have also changed some of the consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The enacted farm bill also includes provisions from the House bill related to the Forest Service's authority to designate insect and disease treatment areas on NFS lands and procedures intended to expedite the environmental analysis for specified priority projects within those areas.
These provisions cover several programs and policies benefitting these sectors, including block grants to states, support for farmers markets, data and information collection, education on food safety and biotechnology, and organic certification, among other market development and promotion initiatives (see Table 14 ).
3005 (Urban Agriculture Act of 2018) supporting urban agriculture development (including new programs and authorization for both mandatory and discretionary funding in the Miscellaneous, Research, Conservation, and Crop Insurance titles).
The new law authorizes $50 million in discretionary funding for FY2019-FY2023 for the Farming Opportunities Training and Outreach program and provides mandatory funding for the program that increases from $30 million in FY2019 to $50 million in FY2023.
The 2018 farm bill includes conforming amendments that address USDA reorganizational changes that created the Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, the Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation, and the Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development."
177,"The court was expressly barred from appointing ""any person who holds or recently held any office of profit or trust under the United States."" Scope of Authority ""[W]ith respect to all matters in [the] independent counsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction,"" Congress granted the independent counsel ""full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and any other officer or employee of the Department of Justice .
DOJ may also task other arms of the Justice Department—such as the Office of the Inspector General—to investigate high-profile, sensitive, and resource-intensive matters regarding ""the Department's compliance with certain legal requirements and [internal] policies and procedures."" For example, recently, in response to concerns raised by some Members of Congress with respect to ""certain prosecutorial and investigative determinations made by the [Department of Justice] in 2016 and 2017,"" Attorney General Sessions considered, but declined to pursue, a separate special counsel inquiry related to allegations of potential misconduct within the Department, noting that special counsel appointments are ""by design, .
Such individuals must be ""a lawyer with a reputation for integrity and impartial decisionmaking, and with appropriate experience to ensure both that the investigation will be conducted ably, expeditiously and thoroughly, and that investigative and prosecutorial decisions will be supported by an informed understanding of the criminal law and Department of Justice policies."" The special counsel may hold other professional roles during his or her service, but is required to agree that the duties of the appointment will take ""first precedence."" Scope of Jurisdiction and Authority Like the appointment and selection process, the sole authority to determine the scope of the special counsel's inquiry rests with the Attorney General.
DOJ has explained that conformance with this notification requirement ""guarantees a 'resulting opportunity for consultation' between the Attorney General and the Special Counsel about the anticipated action, which 'is a critical part of the mechanism through which the Attorney General can discharge his or her responsibilities with respect to the investigation.'"" While the regulations indicate that special counsels ""shall not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any official,"" the rules authorize the Attorney General to ""request that the Special Counsel provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step."" If, after giving the views of the special counsel ""great weight,"" the Attorney General's review of such actions leads him to ""conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued,"" the Attorney General must notify the Chairman and Ranking Members of the Judiciary Committees in Congress of that decision with an explanation.
That provision requires ""Officers of the United States"" to be appointed by the President ""with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,"" although Congress may vest the appointment of ""inferior"" officers ""in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."" Crucially, Article II also empowers the President to hold executive branch officers accountable, through removal if necessary, which the Supreme Court in Myers v.
Removing a Special Counsel Pursuant to the Regulations The Attorney General (or his surrogate if recused) may, consistent with the governing regulations, remove a special counsel ""for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies."" Conceivably, the Attorney General's decision could be the result of an order from the President, as the Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the President and, as the Court has recognized, the President's power to appoint executive branch officials is tied to the power of removal.
1735 , introduced in the 115 th Congress, would have provided that in order to remove a special counsel, the Attorney General must first file an action with a three-judge court; if that panel issues a finding of ""misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause, including violation of policies of the Department of Justice,"" then a special counsel may be removed.
Olson , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a federal prosecutor can be insulated from executive control in the context of the now-expired Independent Counsel Act. Morrison upheld the independent counsel statute, which, as discussed above, vested the appointment of an independent counsel outside of the executive branch and limited the removal authority of the President.
The Court rejected a formalistic rule that would bar statutory for-cause removal protections for an individual tasked with ""purely executive"" functions; instead, it applied a functional test and asked whether Congress has ""interfere[d] with the President's"" executive power and his ""duty to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'"" The Court recognized that the independent counsel operated with a measure of independence from the President, but concluded that the statute gave ""the Executive Branch sufficient control over the independent counsel to ensure that the President is able to perform his constitutionally assigned duties."" Morrison was decided 7-1, with Justice Scalia dissenting from the Court's opinion and Justice Kennedy not participating in the case.
As noted above, in Morrison , the Court examined whether Congress had impermissibly interfered with the President's constitutional duties; it approved of the independent counsel statute's provisions that, among other things, (1) required good cause to remove the independent counsel; (2) largely restricted the Attorney General's discretion in deciding to request the appointment of an independent counsel; and (3) placed the actual power of appointment with a panel of Article III judges.
Bills that limit available remedies to reinstatement, or require this result, depart from the independent counsel statute's provisions, which provided a reviewing court with the option to order reinstatement or issue ""other appropriate relief."" One might distinguish between, on the one hand, a court's undisputed power to determine compliance with the law and award damages for violations, and, on the other, a potential judicial order directing an executive branch official to reappoint an individual to an office.
That bill would bar the removal of a special counsel unless the Attorney General first files a petition with a three-judge court, and that court itself finds ""misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause, including violation of policies of the Department of Justice."" Inserting the judiciary into a removal decision, by requiring a court to determine in the first instance the grounds for the dismissal of an executive branch official before he may be removed, appears to go beyond the restrictions on the President's removal power previously approved by the Supreme Court in Humphrey ' s Executor and Morrison ."
178,"Introduction Political and economic developments in Cuba and U.S. policy toward the island nation, located 90 miles from the United States, have been significant congressional concerns for many years.
President Trump announced a new policy approach toward Cuba in June 2017 that partially rolled back efforts to normalize relations and imposed new sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on the permissible category of people-to-people educational travel to Cuba and on transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military.
It is divided into three major sections analyzing: (1) Cuba's political and economic environment; (2) U.S. policy toward Cuba; and (3) selected issues in U.S.-Cuban relations, including restrictions on travel and trade, democracy and human rights funding for Cuba, U.S. government-sponsored radio and television broadcasting to Cuba (Radio and T Martí), migration issues, antidrug cooperation, property claims, and U.S. fugitives from justice in Cuba.
First the government implemented a series of gradual market-oriented economic policy changes including authorization for limited private sector activity, the legalization of property rights, and an opening to further foreign investment.
As noted above, Raúl Castro had managed the opening of Cuba's economy to the world, with diversified trade relations, increased foreign investment, and a growing private sector, but the slow pace of economic reform stunted economic growth and disheartened Cubans yearning for more economic freedom.
Among the provisions of the new constitution are the addition of an appointed prime minster as head of government to oversee government operations—to be proposed by the President and designated by the National Assembly (Articles 140 and 141); an age limit of 60 to become president (Article 127) with a limit of two five-year terms (Article 126); the right to own private property (Article 22); and the acknowledgement of foreign investment as an important element of the country's economic development (Article 28).
In 2008, Cuba lifted a ban on Cubans staying in hotels that previously had been restricted to foreign tourists in a policy that had been pejoratively referred to as ""tourist apartheid."" In recent years, as the government has enacted limited economic reforms, it has been much more open to debate on economic issues.
In October 2018, the State Department's U.S. Mission to the United Nations launched a campaign to call attention to the plight of Cuba's ""estimated 130 political prisoners."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote an open letter to Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in December 2018, asking for a substantive explanation for the continued detention of eight specific political prisoners and an explanation of the charges and evidence against other individuals held as political prisoners.
According to the State Department's human rights report on Cuba covering 2018, issued in March 2019, the government refused international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations access to its prisons and detention centers, and closely monitored and often harassed domestic human rights organizations.
In its 2018 TIP report, the State Department noted the Cuban government's significant efforts to prosecute and convict more traffickers, create a directorate to provide specialized attention to child victims of crime and violence, including trafficking, and publish its antitrafficking plan for 2017-2020.
(Also see discussions of Cuba's medical missions, which some observer consider forced labor, in the "" Foreign Relations "" and "" Migration Issues "" sections below.) Engagement between U.S. and Cuban officials on antitrafficking issues has increased in recent years.
Key sectors of the economy that generate foreign exchange include the export of professional services (largely medical personnel to Venezuela); tourism, which has grown significantly since the mid-1990s, with an estimated 4.75 million tourists visiting Cuba in 2018; nickel mining, with the Canadian mining company Sherritt International involved in a joint investment project; and a biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector that supplies the domestic health care system and has fostered a significant export industry.
Some reports indicate that as U.S. relations with Cuba have deteriorated under the Trump Administration, Russia has been attempting to increase its ties, including high-level meetings between government officials and increased economic, military, and cultural engagement.
The CACR, which include a prohibition on most financial transactions with Cuba and a freeze of Cuban government assets in the United States, remain the main body of Cuba embargo regulations and have been amended many times over the years to reflect changes in policy.
(For additional information, see section on "" Property Claims and Title III of the LIBERTAD Act "" below.) TSRA authorizes U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba, but it also includes prohibitions on U.S. assistance and private financing and requires ""payment of cash in advance"" or third-country financing for the exports.
In addition to these acts, Congress enacted numerous other provisions of law over the years that imposed sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on trade, foreign aid, and support from international financial institutions.
President Obama said that his Administration would ""end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests."" He maintained that the United States would continue to raise concerns about democracy and human rights in Cuba but stated that ""we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement.""  The policy change included three major steps: (1) the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism in May 2015; (2) the restoration of diplomatic relations in July 2015 (relations had been severed in January 1961 by the Eisenhower Administration); and (3) steps to increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to Cuba.
He stated that ""any changes to the relationship between the United States and Cuba will depend on real progress toward these and other goals."" Once Cuba takes concrete steps in these areas, President Trump said ""we will be ready, willing and able to come to the table to negotiate that much better deal for Cubans, for Americans."" The new policy leaves many of the Obama-era policy changes in place, including the reestablishment of diplomatic relations and a variety of eased sanctions to increase travel and commerce with Cuba.
The new policy also keeps in place the Obama Administration's action ending the so-called wet foot/dry foot policy toward Cuban migrants, which, according to the NSPM, had ""encouraged untold thousands of Cuban nationals to risk their lives to travel unlawfully to the United States."" The most significant policy changes set forth in President Trump's NSPM include (1) restrictions on financial transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel and (2) the elimination of people-to-people educational travel by individuals.
As expected, the Cuban government's reaction to President Trump's June 2017 speech announcing Cuba policy changes was critical, but the government also reiterated its willingness to continue a respectful and cooperative dialogue on issues of mutual interest and the negotiation of outstanding issues, although it maintained that Cuba would not make concessions to its sovereignty and independence.
The Treasury Department forbids financial transactions with those entities, with certain exceptions, including transactions related to air or sea operations supporting permissible travel, cargo, or trade; the sale of agricultural and medical commodities; direct telecommunications or internet access for the Cuban people; and authorized remittances.
The State Department maintained that the United States reiterated the urgent need to identify the source of the ""attacks"" on U.S. diplomats and to ensure they cease (see discussion below), expressed continued concerns about the arbitrary detention of independent journalists and human rights defenders, and acknowledged Cuba's progress in repatriating Cubans with final removal orders while also emphasizing that Cuba needs to accept greater numbers of returnees.
Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained the meeting provided an opportunity to review areas of exchange and cooperation, but it also criticized several aspects of U.S. policy, including the ""intensification"" of the U.S. embargo and what Cuba viewed as the ""political manipulation of the alleged health cases"" that became a ""pretext"" to reduce staff and therefore affect embassy operations in both countries.
(For further background, see "" U.S. Response to Health Injuries of U.S. Personnel in Havana "" below.) ""Troika of Tyranny."" In a November 2018 address in Miami, FL, National Security Adviser John Bolton strongly criticized the Cuban government on human rights, stating that ""we will only engage with a Cuban government that is willing to undertake necessary and tangible reforms—a government that respects the interests of the Cuban people."" Bolton's speech, full of anti-communist political discourse reminiscent of the Cold War era, referred to Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a ""troika of tyranny"" and the ""cause of immense human suffering, the impetus of enormous regional instability, and the genesis of a sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere."" He referred to the three countries' leaders as ""three stooges of socialism"" and as ""clownish pitiful figures."" Bolton asserted that the Venezuelan regime's repression has been ""enabled by the Cuban dictatorship."" In 2019, as the political situation in Venezuela has deteriorated and the United States has ramped up sanctions on the Maduro regime, the Trump Administration has increased its criticism of Cuba's support for the regime.
Then, on March 4, Secretary Pompeo partially suspended the right to file lawsuits for an additional 30 days (through April 17) but allowed lawsuits, beginning March 19, against an entity or subentity on the State Department's ""Cuba Restricted List"" controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services.
The Trump Administration's policy of rolling back some of the Obama-era changes and introducing new sanctions on Cuba also has highlighted divisions in Congress over Cuba policy, with some Members supporting the President's action because of Cuba's lack of progress on human rights and others opposing it because of the potential negative effect on the Cuban people and U.S. business interests.
President Trump's NSPM on Cuba stated that the Administration would not reinstate the ""wet foot/dry foot"" policy, maintaining that the policy had ""encouraged untold thousands of Cuban nationals to risk their lives to travel unlawfully to the United States."" Background on the 1994 and 1995 Migration Accords .
Over the years, the number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard has fluctuated annually, influenced by several factors, including the economic situations in Cuba and the United States.
According to the State Department's 2019 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), issued in March 2019, Cuba has 40 bilateral agreements for antidrug cooperation with countries worldwide, including the 2016 U.S.-Cuban agreement noted above."
179,"After meeting with President Kagame in Davos in January 2018, President Trump praised the United States' ""great relationships"" with Rwanda, including bilateral trade, and stated that ""the job they've done is absolutely terrific."" In September 2017 congressional testimony, then Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Yamamoto praised Rwanda's ""remarkable gains"" in health and development and characterized the country as ""a major contributor to regional peace and security,"" while asserting that ""Rwanda's record in the areas of human rights and democracy, while improved in some areas, remains a concern."" He called on the government ""to take steps toward a democratic transition of power.""  Regarding Rwanda's 2017 presidential election, the State Department stated that ""we are disturbed by irregularities observed during voting and reiterate long-standing concerns over the integrity of the vote-tabulation process."" In response to Member questions at the September 2017 hearing, Ambassador Yamamoto affirmed that ""we are unable to assess this election as free and fair."" At his Senate confirmation hearing in late 2017, the U.S. Ambassador-designate to Rwanda described his four top policy goals as the following: continuing the United States' ""development partnership"" with Rwanda, promoting U.S. business and economic ties, supporting Rwanda's continued peacekeeping role, and advancing ""democratic ideals."" President Trump suspended duty-free treatment of Rwandan apparel exports to the United States under AGOA in 2018, as noted above, citing Rwandan protectionist policies.
Citing such provisions, as well as the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 (CSPA, Title IV of P.L. 110-457 ), the Obama Administration suspended certain types of military aid—namely, Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET)—citing Rwandan support for rebels in DRC and, later, Burundi.
FY2014: The Obama Administration continued to suspend FMF, consistent with a provision in that year's appropriations act ( P.L. 113-76 , §7042(l) of Division K) restricting such funds unless Rwanda was ""taking steps to cease"" support to certain armed groups in DRC.
FY2015: The appropriations act prohibited FMF for Rwanda unless the Secretary of State certified to Congress that the government was ""implementing a policy to cease"" support to armed groups in DRC ( P.L. 113-235 , §7042[l] of Division J)."
180,"(See precise criteria under the TRIA program below.) Goals and Specifics of the Current TRIA Program The original TRIA legislation's stated goals were to (1) create a temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured terrorism losses to allow the private market to stabilize; (2) protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risks; and (3) preserve state regulation of insurance.
Terrorism Loss Sharing Criteria To meet the first goal, the TRIA program creates a mechanism through which the federal government could share insured commercial property and casualty losses with the private insurance market.
7. In the years following the federal sharing of insurer losses, but prior to September 30, 2024, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to establish surcharges on TRIA-eligible property and casualty insurance policies to recoup 140% of some or all of the outlays to insurers under the program.
The general result of the recoupment provisions is that, for attacks that result in under $37.5 billion in insured losses, the Treasury Secretary is required to recoup 140% of the government outlays through surcharges on property and casualty insurance policies.
The current TRIA statute does not specifically include or exclude NBCR events; thus, the TRIA program in general would cover insured losses from terrorist actions due to NCBR as it would for an attack by conventional means.
In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was directed to study the issue and a GAO report was issued in 2008, finding that ""insurers generally remain unwilling to offer NBCR coverage because of uncertainties about the risk and the potential for catastrophic losses."" In the past, legislation (e.g., H.R. 4871 in the 113 th Congress) would have provided for differential treatment of NBCR attacks under TRIA, but such legislation has not been enacted."
181,"Later, multilevel government responses to disasters such as Hurricane Katrina expanded the concept of homeland security to include disasters, public health emergencies, and other events that threaten the United States, its economy, the rule of law, and government operations.
the protection of U.S. sovereignty, territory, domestic population, and critical defense infrastructure against external threats and aggression, or other threats as directed by the President."" Homeland security, on the other hand, is a more broadly coordinated effort, involving not only military activities, but the operations of civilian agencies at all levels of government.
Some DHS components have legacy missions that do not directly relate to conventional homeland security definitions, such as the Coast Guard, and Congress has in the past debated whether FEMA and its disaster relief and recovery missions belong in the department.
Analyzing Costs Across Government Section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 required the President's annual budget request to include an analysis of homeland security funding across the federal government—not just DHS.
The resulting data series, which included agency-reported data on spending in three categories—preventing and disrupting terrorist attacks; protecting the American people, critical infrastructure, and key resources; and responding to and recovering from incidents—provides a limited snapshot of the scope of the federal government's investment in homeland security.
Provisions in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) established the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) as the coordinator at the federal level for terrorism information and assessment and created the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to provide strategic management across the 17 organizational elements of the IC.
OIA combines information collected by DHS components as part of their operational activities (i.e., those conducted at airports, seaports, and the border) with foreign intelligence from the IC; law enforcement information from federal, state, local, territorial and tribal sources; and private sector data about critical infrastructure and strategic resources.
In December 2015, the joint explanatory statement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ) stated that DHS ""lacks a mechanism for capturing and understanding research and development (R&D) activities conducted across DHS, as well as coordinating R&D to reflect departmental priorities."" A challenge for external coordination is that the majority of homeland security-related R&D is conducted by other agencies, most notably the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.
Instead, the S&T Directorate has developed R&D plans with selected individual agencies, and the National Science and Technology Council (a coordinating entity in the Executive Office of the President) has issued government-wide R&D strategies in selected topical areas, such as biosurveillance.
The overarching goal of the strategy is to ""defeat the terrorists who threaten America's safety, prevent future attacks, and protect our national interests."" In describing the need for this strategy, National Security Advisor John Bolton stated that the terrorist ""landscape is more fluid and complex than ever"" and that the strategy will not ""focus on a single organization but will counter all terrorists with the ability and intent to harm the United States, its citizens and our interests."" The strategy states that a "" new approach "" will be implemented containing six primary thematic areas of focus: (1) pursuing terrorists to their source; (2) isolating terrorists from their sources of support; (3) modernizing and integrating the United States' counterterrorism authorities and tools; (4) protecting American infrastructure and enhancing resilience; (5) countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment; and (6) strengthening the counterterrorism abilities of U.S. international partners.
In a December 2018 study, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, ""new threats to the nation's pipeline systems have evolved to include sabotage by environmental activists and cyber attack or intrusion by nations."" In a 2018 Federal Register notice, the Transportation Security Administration stated that it expects pipeline companies will report approximately 32 ""security incidents"" annually—both physical and cyber.
300 ) would require the Secretary of Energy to enhance coordination among government agencies and the energy sector in pipeline security; coordinate incident response and recovery; support the development of pipeline cybersecurity applications, technologies, demonstration projects, and training curricula; and provide technical tools for pipeline security.
This proposal would not affect any law enforcement or military agencies with explicit statutory authority to protect executive branch officials, such as the USSS or the Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service.
Potential Issues for Congress The Administration's proposal appears to authorize the USMS to staff all protective details of executive branch officials (excluding the USSS and the Departments of State and Defense) deemed to need security, even protective security details that presently are staffed by agencies' employees.
The 116 th Congress is considering a mix of tactical infrastructure, including fencing, surveillance technologies, and personnel to enhance border security between U.S. POEs. Some experts have warned that the northern border may need more resources and oversight than it is currently receiving in light of potential national security risks.
As authorized in part by the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA; P.L. 109-295 ), the President, acting through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator, is directed to create a ""national preparedness goal"" (NPG) and develop a ""national preparedness system"" (NPS) that will help ""ensure the Nation's ability to prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters"" (6 U.S.C.
Congress may have interest in overseeing a variety of factors related to the NPS, such as whether the NPS conforms to the objectives of Congress, as outlined in the PKEMRA statute; the NPS is properly informed by quantitative and qualitative data and outcome metrics, such as those gathered by the THIRA and SPR, as has been regularly recommended by the Government Accountability Office; federal roles and responsibilities have, in Congress's opinion, been properly assigned and resourced to execute the core capabilities needed to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from the greatest risks; nonfederal resources and stakeholders are efficiently incorporated into NPS policies; and federal, state, and local government officials are allocating the appropriate amount of resources to the disaster preparedness mission relative to other homeland security missions.
§§5121 et seq.), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may provide various temporary housing assistance programs to meet disaster survivors' needs.
Congress may also evaluate the roles of government and private/nonprofit entities in providing disaster housing assistance; require FEMA to collaborate with disaster housing partners to identify and outline short, interim, and long-term disaster housing solutions; and require an update to the National Disaster Housing Strategy to reflect the roles and responsibilities of housing partners, current practices and solutions, and the findings of any such evaluations.
§5133)—Predisaster Hazard Mitigation—the President may provide financial and technical assistance by setting aside up to 6% of the estimated aggregated amount of certain federal grant assistance from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), including grants made pursuant to awards of Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) under the Stafford Act. Previously, predisaster mitigation was funded by discretionary annual appropriations, and financial assistance was limited by the amount available in the National Predisaster Mitigation Fund, which was separate from the DRF.
The NFIP has two main policy goals: (1) to provide access to primary flood insurance, thereby allowing for the transfer of some of the financial risk from property owners to the federal government, and (2) to mitigate and reduce the nation's comprehensive flood risk through the development and implementation of floodplain management standards.
Premiums and Affordability Historically, Congress has asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to set NFIP premiums that are simultaneously ""risk-based"" and ""reasonable."" Except for certain subsidies, statute directs that NFIP flood insurance rates should reflect the true flood risk to the property.
In response, Congress established firefighter assistance grant programs within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide additional support for local fire departments.
Issues for the 116th Congress The 116 th Congress may continue its oversight of the effectiveness of emergency communications before, during, and after natural or man-made disasters (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires), and the roles and responsibilities of federal, state, and local agencies, and private telecommunications providers during response.
Congress may also to examine the effectiveness of federal programs established to promote and support emergency communications, including  National 9-1-1 Program administered by the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation, which provides federal leadership and coordination in supporting and promoting optimal 911 services; First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), the federal authority within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the U.S. Department of Commerce established to create the nationwide public safety broadband network; Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), the national alerting system administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); Emergency Communications Division in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is responsible for promoting interoperable and coordinated communications across all levels of government; and federal grant programs that fund emergency communications.
Congress may also focus on the activities of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB), which administers FCC policies related to emergency communications, including rules for carriers supporting 911 services; state and local use of 911 fees; public safety spectrum; public alerts, including rules for carriers delivering wireless alerts to mobile phones; disaster management and reporting of private network outages; and restoration efforts."
182,"General Committee Procedure Committee Chairs, Membership, and Organization Committee Chairmanship Limits In the 116 th Congress, H.Res. 6 struck clause 5(c)(2) of Rule X, which stated that a Member could not serve as chair of the same standing committee or subcommittee for more than three consecutive Congresses (disregarding any service of less than a full session), except on the Committee on Rules.
House rules were amended in the 93 rd Congress (1973-1974) to allow the Delegates and Resident Commissioner, effective in the subsequent Congress, to be appointed to conference committees on legislation reported from committees on which they served.
Service of Indicted Members on Committees H.Res. 6 amended clause 10 of Rule XXIII, adding a provision that calls on any Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner who has been indicted or formally charged with a felony offense that is punishable by at least two years in prison to resign from committee assignments and party caucus or conference leadership positions.
According to the Rules Committee's summary of H.Res. 6, the ""change is intended to grant committees adequate time to organize, as some committees do not have a full complement of members at the start of a Congress."" Hearing and Markup Procedure Requiring Committee Hearing and Markup on Bills and Joint Resolutions In a separate order, the rules package requires that, during the 116 th Congress, after March 1, 2019, certain lawmaking measures must be reported and be subject to related committee hearings and a markup prior to floor consideration.
Thus, according to the Rules Committee summary of H.Res. 6, ""Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner may participate in all such depositions, but their presence is not required.""

183,"In recent years, Congress has authorized DOD to use incremental funding for procuring certain Navy ships, most notably aircraft carriers: Section 121 of the FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 5122 / P.L. 109-364 of October 17, 2006) granted the Navy the authority to use four-year incremental funding for CVNs 78, 79, and 80.
The Ford -class design uses the basic Nimitz -class hull form but incorporates several improvements, including features permitting the ship to generate more aircraft sorties per day, more electrical power for supporting ship systems, and features permitting the ship to be operated by several hundred fewer sailors than a Nimitz -class ship, reducing 50-year life-cycle operating and support (O&S) costs for each ship by about $4 billion compared to the Nimitz -class design, the Navy estimates.
1356 / P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015) further amended the cost cap for the CVN-78 program to provide a revised cap of $11,398.0 million for each follow-on ship in the program, plus adjustment for inflation and other factors, and with a new provision stating that, if during construction of CVN-79, the Chief of Naval Operations determines that measures required to complete the ship within the revised cost cap shall result in an unacceptable reduction to the ship's operational capability, the Secretary of the Navy may increase the CVN-79 cost cap by up to $100 million (i.e., to $11.498 billion).
In an August 2, 2017, letter to the congressional defense committees, then-Acting Secretary of the Navy Sean Stackley notified the committees that under subsection (b)(7) of Section 122 of P.L. 114-92 as amended by Section 121 of P.L. 113-66 —a subsection allowing increases to the cost cap for CVN-78 for ""the amounts of increases or decreases in costs of that ship that are attributable solely to an urgent and unforeseen requirement identified as a result of the shipboard test program""—he had increased the cost cap for CVN-78 by $20 million, to $12,907.0 million.
In a May 8, 2018, letter to the congressional defense committees, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer notified the committees that under subsections (b)(6) and (b)(7) of Section 122 of P.L. 114-92 as amended by Section 121 of P.L. 113-66 —subsections allowing increases to the cost cap for CVN-78 for ""the amounts of increases or decreases to cost required to correct deficiencies that may affect the safety of the ship and personnel or otherwise preclude the ship from safe operation and crew certification"" and for ""the amounts of increases or decreases in costs of CVN 78 that are attributable solely to an urgent and unforeseen requirement identified as a result of the shipboard test program,"" respectively—he had increased the cost cap for CVN-78 by $120 million, to $13,027 million.
McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 ( H.R. 5515 / P.L. 115-232 of August 13, 2018)—the provision that authorized the two-ship block buy contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81—subsection (a)(1) specifically authorizes a contract for the procurement of CVN-81 ""beginning with the fiscal year 2019 program year."" The header for subsection (a)(1) is ""Procurement Authorized."" Consistent with Section 121(a)(1), the funding table for the Navy's shipbuilding account in the conference report ( H.Rept.
This paragraph also states that ""the funds made available by this Act for the Carrier Replacement Program (CVN-80) may be available to modify or enter into a new contract for the procurement of a Ford-class aircraft carrier designated CVN–81 pursuant to section 121 of the John S.
DOD's decision to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020, instead of a ship that was procured in FY2019, also affects the aircraft carrier procurement profile shown in the Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) 30-year shipbuilding plan.
Cost growth on CVN-78 required the Navy to program $1,394.9 million in cost-to-complete procurement funding for the ship in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018 (see Table 1 ).
(a) Limitation.—Of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2017 for advance procurement or procurement for the U.S.S. Enterprise (CVN–80), not more than 25 percent may be obligated or expended until the date on which the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations jointly submit to the congressional defense committees the report under subsection (b).
(b) Initial report on CVN–79 and CVN–80.—Not later than December 1, 2016, the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations shall jointly submit to the congressional defense committees a report that includes a description of actions that may be carried out (including de-scoping requirements, if necessary) to achieve a ship end cost of— (1) not more than $12,000,000,000 for the CVN–80; and (2) not more than $11,000,000,000 for the U.S.S. John F.
At a November 27, 2018, hearing on Navy shipbuilding programs before the Seapower subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the following exchange occurred: SENATOR TIM KAINE (continuing):  There have been challenges with the advanced weapons elevators on the CVN, some of the technical difficult[ies] seem similar to those that were experienced earlier on both the [aircraft] launch and arresting systems.
""However, we are making substantial substantial progress in resolving the remaining technical challenges."" A January 6, 2019, press report stated the following: The Navy Secretary has committed that the service and its industry partners will have working weapons elevators on aircraft carrier USS Gerald R.
In July 2018, when Ford entered PSA, the Navy said the maintenance availability had been extended from a planned eight months to a full year, to accommodate both the typical work that arises in PSA but also deferred work such as the construction and installation of weapons elevators and an upgrade to the AAG, whose technical challenges greatly contributed to the delayed delivery and commissioning of the ship.
As noted in previous annual reports, the CVN 78 test schedule has been aggressive, and the development of EMALS [Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System], AAG [Advanced Arresting gear], AWE [Advanced Weapons Elevator], DBR [Dual Band Radar], and the Integrated Warfare System delayed the ship's first deployment to FY22.
Regarding the CVN-78 program, the report stated the following: Technology Maturity, Design Stability, and Production Readiness The Navy accepted delivery of the lead ship, CVN 78, in May 2017 despite challenges related to immature technologies and struggles to demonstrate the reliability of mature systems.
Other Program Issues CVN 78's procurement costs increased by 23 percent over its initial cost cap and as a result of continuing technical deficiencies, the Navy may still require more funding to complete this ship.
Congress raised the cost cap for CVN 80 and later ships to $12.6 billion and approved the Navy's plans to buy two carriers—CVNs 80 and 81—at the same time, based on the shipbuilder's estimate that this strategy will save the Navy over $2 billion.
The program also stated that, with CVN 79 construction 55 percent complete, shipbuilder cost performance remains stable, but slightly below the level needed to achieve production labor hour reduction targets.
The program said that the Navy plans to deliver a complete, deployable ship as scheduled and within the cost cap to maintain an 11-carrier fleet.
This concept variant might, if procured in sufficient numbers, eventually enable the Navy to reduce the number of Ford-class carriers in the overall force structure, but more-extensive analysis of missions, operations, and basing of such a variant and the supported air combat element is required.
Ford-class aircraft carriers while saving money it is starting to look at future carrier procurement, which might be very different.… Modly said Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer sees $13 billion carriers as not sustainable going forward and the service will be looking at ways to further reduce costs or keep the carrier capabilities more affordable in future ship procurements.
Until it was withdrawn, the proposal in the Navy's FY2020 budget submission to not fund CVN-75's RCOH and instead decommission the ship (and a carrier air wing) raised a number of potential oversight issues for Congress, including the following: Compliance with congressional direction.
Compared to DOD's estimate that the two-ship block buy contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81 would produce savings of $3.9 billion (as measured from estimated costs for the two ships in the December 2017 Navy business case analysis), DOD states that ""the Department of Defense's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) developed an Independent Estimate of Savings for the two-ship procurement and forecast savings of $3.1 billion ([in] Then-Year [dollars]), or approximately 11 percent....
The Navy's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and the shipbuilder's investment in iDS, totaling $631 million, will reduce the amount of production effort required to build FORD Class carriers.
The Navy's selected acquisition report on the CVN-79 states that ""the Navy and shipbuilder have made fundamental changes in the manner in which the CVN 79 will be built to incorporate lessons learned from CVN 78 and eliminate the key contributors to cost performance challenges realized in the construction of CVN 78."" Nevertheless, the Navy informed CBO that there is a greater than 60 percent chance that the ship's final cost will be more than the current estimate.
August 2018 Press Report An August 17, 2018, press report states the following: Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc., the sole U.S. builder of aircraft carriers, continues to fall short of the Navy's demand to cut labor expenses to stay within an $11.39 billion cost cap mandated by Congress on the second in a new class of warships.
September 2017 Press Report A September 26, 2017, press report states the following: Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. is falling short of a U.S. Navy goal to reduce hours of labor on the second ship in the new Ford class of aircraft carriers in a drive to reduce costs, according to service documents.
June 2017 GAO Report A June 2017 GAO report states the following: The cost estimate for the second Ford-Class aircraft carrier, CVN 79, is not reliable and does not address lessons learned from the performance of the lead ship, CVN 78.
Navy analysis shows that the CVN 79 cost estimate may not sufficiently account for program risks, with the current budget likely insufficient to complete ship construction.
Based on lessons learned on CVN 78, the approach to carrier construction has undergone an extensive affordability review and the Navy and the shipbuilder have made significant changes on CVN 79 to reduce the cost to build the ship.
The Navy will deliver the CVN 79 within the cost cap using a two-phased strategy wherein select ship systems and compartments that are more efficiently completed at a later stage of construction - to avoid obsolescence or to leverage competition or the use of experienced installation teams - will be scheduled for completion in the ship's second phase of production and test.
Low or unknown reliability and performance of the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), the Dual Band Radar (DBR), and the Advanced Weapons Elevators (AWE) are significant risks to a successful IOT&E and first deployment, as well as to achieving the life-cycle cost reductions the Navy has estimated will accrue for the Ford-class carriers.
The Secretary of the Navy directed a detailed review of the CVN 78 program build plan to improve end-to-end aircraft carrier design, material procurement, production planning, build and test, the results of which are providing benefit across all carriers.
In conjunction with the Navy and the shipbuilder's comprehensive review of the build strategy and processes used in construction of CVN 78 Class aircraft carriers, a number of design changes were identified that would result in more affordable construction.
The CVN 80 planning and construction will continue to leverage class lessons learned in the effort to achieve cost and risk reduction for remaining FORD Class ships.
The Navy recently awarded a construction contract for CVN 79 which it believes will allow the program to achieve the current $11.5 billion legislative cost cap.
July 2015 Press Report A July 2, 2015, press report states the following: The Navy plans to spend $25 million per year beginning in 2017 as a way to invest in lowering the cost of building the services' new Ford-class aircraft carriers, service officials said.
June 2015 Press Reports A June 29, 2015, press report states the following: Newport News Shipbuilding will see cost reduction on the order of 18 percent fewer man hours overall from the first Ford-class aircraft carrier to the second, according to a company representative.
The Navy and the shipbuilder have made significant changes on CVN 79 to reduce the cost to build the ship as detailed in the 2013 CVN 79 report to Congress.
As a result of lessons learned on CVN 78, the approach to carrier construction has undergone an extensive affordability review; and the Navy and the shipbuilder have made significant changes on CVN 79 that will reduce the cost to build the ship.
The Navy continues implementing actions from the 2012 detailed review of the FORD-Class build plan to control cost and improve performance across lead and follow ship contracts.
March 2013 Navy Report A March 2013 report to Congress on the Navy's plan for building CVN-79 that was released to the public on May 16, 2013, states the following in its executive summary: As a result of the lessons learned on CVN 78, the approach to carrier construction has undergone an extensive affordability review and the Navy and the shipbuilder have made significant changes on CVN 79 that will significantly reduce the cost to build the ship.
At that time, I reported the current estimate for the Navy's share of the shipbuilder's construction overrun, $690 million, and described that I had directed an end-to-end review to identify the changes necessary to improve cost for carrier design, material procurement, planning, build and test.
In order to significantly improve production labor performance, based on timely receipt of design and material, the Navy and shipbuilder are reviewing and implementing changes to the CVN 79 build plan and affected facilities."
184,"In addition to the Twenty-Second Amendment cited above, the Twelfth, ratified in 1804, set the same qualifications for the Vice President; the Twentieth, ratified in 1933, set January 20 of every year following a presidential election as the date on which the chief executive's term begins; and the Twenty-Fifth Amendment clarified the question of vice-presidential succession to the presidency and authorized the President to nominate persons to fill vacancies in the vice presidency, subject to approval by vote of both houses of Congress.
Presidential Term of Office: Current Provisions and Options for Change The conditions of terms and tenure for the President and Vice President of the United States have evolved over nearly two centuries, from the earliest provisions in Article II, Section 1, of the U.S. Constitution, set by the Constitutional Convention in 1787, to provisions governing vacancies in the office of Vice President established in the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967.
Since that time, most proposed amendments related to the President's term and tenure have (1) called either for a six-year presidential term, usually without the possibility of reelection; or (2) proposed repeal of the Twenty-Second Amendment, allowing individuals to be elected President more than twice.
In addition, most contained a variant of the existing Twenty-Second Amendment provision for Vice Presidents who succeed to the highest office: they would be eligible for election in their own right to a term as President provided they had served less than three years of the term to which their predecessor was elected.
History of Congressional Activity As noted earlier, the proposal to establish a single six-year term for the President and Vice President was a hardy perennial from the early days of the republic: 212 such amendments were introduced between the 19 th through 104 th Congresses.
Since that time, 46 proposed amendments that would eliminate the two-term presidential election limit have been introduced in Congress, most in the House of Representatives, and most recently in the 113 th Congress.
Public sentiment for repeal of the Twenty-Second Amendment is arguably associated with support for extending the tenure of popular two-term chief executives whose presidencies are perceived at the time as having been successful.
Beyond the immediate ambit of legislative proposals, the idea, if not the reality, of repealing the Twenty-Second Amendment does appear to gain publicity and a level of at least theoretical support when term-limited Presidents approach the end of their time in office.
The question of repeal regained support early in President Bill Clinton's second term in office, when five relevant amendments were introduced in the 105 th Congress (1997-1998), while more recently, in 2014, Change.org, a petition website, sponsored an ""Obama-for-3"" Political Action Committee that circulated an online petition to repeal the amendment and thus enable President Barack Obama to run for a third term.
Supporters of presidential term limits in general and the Twenty-Second Amendment in particular argue that eight years is time enough for any individual in a position of such great power as the presidency of the United States.
The legislative language used most frequently has been, ""[t]he twenty-second article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed."" As was noted earlier in this report, repeal of the Twenty-Second Amendment appeared in some proposals to establish a single six-year term for President.
The Democratic National Convention responded to Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid by adopting a plank in its 1912 platform that called for ""an amendment to the Constitution making the President of the United States ineligible to reelection."" Following the election, the Democratic-controlled 62 nd Congress moved to implement the proposal, and a single-term amendment passed the Senate by the requisite two-thirds majority in February 1913, even before Wilson's inauguration.
The amendment, which was proposed to the states on March 2, 1932, included the following provisions: Terms of the President and Vice President would end on January 20 of the year following a presidential election.
The Twenty-Second Amendment: ""Term Limits"" for the President In 1946, the Republican Party regained control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 16 years.
The Senate version of the amendment, as agreed to in the House and proposed to the states, included the following provisions: No person could be elected to the office of President more than twice.
240), passed by the Second Congress (1791-1793), addressed the issue, authorizing the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, in that order, to act as President until a special election could be held to fill a presidential vacancy, unless the vacancy occurred late in the last full year of the incumbent's term of office.
In the 20 th century, three constitutional amendments made incremental changes in certain conditions of presidential tenure, most notably the Twenty-Second Amendment's establishment of limits on the number of times a person could be elected President of the United States.
Certain questions do occasionally rise to command some degree of public attention, including speculation on the applicability of the Twenty-Second Amendment to Presidents who have been elected twice, or proposals for constitutional changes that would repeal the amendment or establish a single six-year presidential and vice presidential term."
185,"Frequently Asked Questions This report addresses frequently asked questions related to the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for executive, administrative, and professional employees (the ""EAP"" or ""white collar"" exemptions).
In addition to the standard salary level, in 2004 DOL created a ""highly compensated employee"" (HCE) exemption in which employees earning an amount above the standard EAP salary threshold annually are exempt from overtime requirements if they perform at least one (among many) of the duties of an EAP employee.
Due to other provisions of the FLSA, however, many personnel at IHEs are not eligible for overtime on the basis of the duties test alone and thus are unaffected by changes in the EAP standard salary level for exemption.
In general, employees of state and local governments are covered by the overtime provisions of the FLSA and thus are affected by EAP rulemaking updating the salary level threshold for the EAP exemptions.
The main changes to the EAP exemptions in the 2019 proposed rule, as summarized in Table 1 , include the following: an increase in the salary level test from the current $455 per week ($23,660 annually) to $679 per week ($35,308 annually); an increase in the annual salary threshold for the HCE exemption from $100,000 to $147,414; an allowance that up to 10% of the standard salary level may be comprised of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions; a salary level of $455 per week for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and of $380 in American Samoa; and an increase in the ""base rate"" weekly salary level for employees in the motion picture industry from $695 per week to $1,036 per week."
186,"Introduction This report provides background information on the types of water supply and wastewater treatment projects traditionally funded by the federal government and the several existing programs to assist communities with water supply and wastewater treatment.
In contrast, standing program authorizations provide project funding for other agencies, including the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Other federal authorities of USDA's Rural Utilities Service, Reclamation, and USACE may be available to assist with the provision of emergency water and wastewater needs, such as improving access to water supplies during a drought.
However, for M&I projects under rural water and Title XVI authorities, Congress has authorized terms providing some or all federal funding for projects on a nonreimbursable basis (i.e. a de facto grant).
Most recently, amendments to Title XVI enacted in December 2016 in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act, P.L. 114-322 ) made changes to the program, including authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to accept and review nonfederal feasibility studies for potential planning, design, and construction projects.
Eligibility Requirements Similar to other Reclamation activities, the Title XVI water reclamation and wastewater recycling program is limited to projects and studies in the 17 western states unless otherwise specified.
The WIIN Act provided DOI with additional authority to accept nonfederal feasibility studies and approve and consider these projects for construction funding if they meet Title XVI program criteria, including that (1) the study complies with federal laws and regulations applicable to water reuse and recycling studies, and (2) the project is technically and financially feasible and provides a federal benefit in accordance with Reclamation laws.
Eligibility Requirements For new USACE projects with M&I water supply, existing law and agency policy require that (1) water supply benefits and costs be equitably allocated among multiple purposes; (2) repayment by state or local interests be agreed to before construction; (3) the water supply allocation for anticipated demand at any project not exceed 30% of the total estimated cost; (4) repayment shall be either during construction (without interest), or over 30 years (with adjustable interest rates); and (5) users reimburse USACE annually for all operation and maintenance or replacement costs.
Environmental Infrastructure Assistance Project Purpose Federal policy generally is that community water supply is a local and state responsibility.
Since 1992, Congress has enacted more than 400 authorizations allowing USACE to provide designated communities, counties, and states with design and construction assistance for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure (including treatment, and distribution/collection facilities) and source water protection and development; these activities are known as environmental infrastructure projects.
Most of USACE environmental infrastructure authorities specify a specific geographic location (e.g., a city, county, or state) and types of projects (e.g., municipal drinking water) as the principal eligibility requirements.
The law directs that USDA make grants of 1% to 3% of total grant funding to qualified nonprofits to provide technical assistance and training to help communities in preparing applications for grants and loans and to help problem solving operation and maintenance of existing water and waste disposal facilities in rural areas.
Grants for the development costs of water supply and waste disposal projects in rural areas also are authorized under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. Only communities with poverty and intermediate rate incomes qualify for USDA grants.
The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) authorized $5 million per year through FY2018 for USDA to make grants to private nonprofit organizations for the purpose of providing loans to eligible individuals for construction, refurbishing, and servicing of individually owned household water well systems.
Title VII (Section 780) provided an additional $500 million for the grant and loan program ""of which not to exceed $495,000,000 shall be for grants."" Out of the total FY2018 funds, USDA has appropriations of $1.0 million for grants to capitalize revolving loans for water and waste disposal systems and $68 million to support water and waste disposal projects in the colonias, Alaskan Native communities, and Hawaiian Native communities.
Statutory and Regulatory Authority Statutory authority for the water and waste disposal loan and grant programs is the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, as amended, Section 306, 7 U.S.C. 1926.
These funds are used to assist localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs most recently estimated (in 2016) by EPA and states at $271 billion nationally (over the next 20 years) for all categories of projects eligible for federal assistance under the law.
Funding Since the first appropriations for the clean water SRF program in FY1989, Congress has provided more than $46 billion in grants to states and Puerto Rico to capitalize their CWSRFs. Through March 2018, federal funds, together with state matching contributions, repaid loans, and other funds, have been used for $126 billion in SRF assistance to support more than 39,000 SRF loans and debt refinance agreements.
[This section was prepared by Jonathan Ramseur, Specialist in Resources and Environmental Policy, Resources, Science and Industry Division.] Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Loan Program The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires public water systems to comply with federal drinking water regulations promulgated by EPA.
To help communities meet these federal mandates and to meet the act's public health objectives, Congress amended the SDWA in 1996 to establish a drinking water state revolving fund (DWSRF) loan program.

187,"In general, special rules enable the consideration of complex or contentious legislation, such as major appropriations or reauthorizations, while the suspension of the rules procedure is usually applied to broadly supported legislation that can be approved without floor amendments or extensive debate in the chamber.
Figures 1- 8 display statistical data, including the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsors of measures, committee consideration, length of floor debate, voting, and resolution of differences between the chambers.
As Rule XV states, ""the Speaker may not entertain a motion that the House suspend the rules except on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays and during the last six days of a session of Congress."" Suspension measures, however, may be considered on other days by unanimous consent or under the terms of a special order of business (special rule) reported by the Committee on Rules and agreed to by the House.

188,"To do this, the report first examines historical trends in federal spending and revenue policy to illustrate both the challenges and trade-offs inherent to making choices between (1) limiting the provision of defense and domestic public goods, (2) reducing transfers to persons including entitlements for the elderly and those with low income, (3) reducing support for state and local governments, and (4) raising taxes.
Therefore, to address the budget shortfalls facing the country over the long run, it is likely that (1) transfer payments, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, to or on behalf of individuals (which already account for half of federal spending and are growing) must be reduced; (2) transfers to state and local governments must be reduced (which would shift the budget decisions to a different level of government); (3) taxes must be raised; or some combination of the three.
Reductions in discretionary spending are insufficient to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level; thus, limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in mandatory spending, including entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
Federal Spending: Patterns over Time The objectives of government spending and taxes are generally viewed as providing for public and quasi-public goods, such as defense, law enforcement, infrastructure, and education; correcting market failures, including externalities (both negative, such as pollution, and positive, such as research and development); achieving distributive justice; and managing business cycles.
The discussion in this section indicates that although total spending as a percentage of GDP fluctuated around 20% of GDP between 1973 and 2007, government involvement in the economy—narrowly defined as using resources to provide public goods directly—had fallen by a third and outside of defense had remained roughly constant and small (at around 2% of output).
Nondefense discretionary funding, although small as a share of the budget and of GDP, is largely the spending that many people think of when they think of the direct provision of goods and services by the federal government.
These comparisons, shown in Table 4 , provide a similar picture to the previous allocation: although total spending as a share of output has fluctuated somewhat from FY1980 to FY2018, the federal government has an increasing share of output in health and programs for the elderly, with declining shares for almost every other functional category.
Income taxes are the main source of revenue for most federal spending outside of Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI, whose benefits are less than half of Medicare spending).
(This table does not include earnings from interest on government securities held by the funds and transfers of income taxes collected on Social Security benefits; it also does not reflect administrative costs.) As indicated in the table, OASI payroll tax revenue (as a percentage of GDP) has declined over the past 11 years, while payments have increased substantially.
Since its implementation in 1935, Social Security has been treated as a separate program, similar to a retirement plan, in which contributions (e.g., payroll taxes) during the working years create an entitlement to benefits in old age.
Thus, it would appear that major reductions in Social Security and health spending would be required to constrain tax levels at current percentages of GDP.
The Solutions Initiative III proposals all choose to raise additional revenue, which reduces the required cutbacks in Social Security and health spending to address the long-run deficit.
This additional revenue allows the Solutions Initiative III proposals to achieve their policy goal with reductions in Social Security and health care spending of 0.9% of GDP.
Although the Solutions Initiative III plans and their approaches are illustrative, they are also suggestive of what would likely be necessary to hold the tax revenues fixed and address the long-run deficit: major changes to government programs for health care and other entitlements."
189,"The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, ""without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.""  The 1934 Act is divided into titles and sections that describe various powers and concerns of the commission.
Targets and measures are published in the FCC's Performance Plan, and submitted with the commission's annual budget request to Congress.
FCC Operations: Budget, Authorization, and Reporting to Congress Since the 110 th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item.
His support of this regulatory philosophy can be seen in the language used in the strategic goals, such as ""reducing regulatory burdens"" and ensuring that ""regulations reflect the realities of the current marketplace, promote entrepreneurship, expand economic opportunity, and remove barriers to entry and investment.""  The use of this particular language may seem somewhat vague, but within the context of the net neutrality debate, discussed below, and the replacement of the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis with the Office of Economics and Analytics, those words take on more specific meaning, each intending to support the policy agenda of the Chairman.
The new Office of Economics and Analytics is ""responsible for expanding and deepening the use of economic analysis into FCC policy making, for enhancing the development and use of auctions, and for implementing consistent and effective agency-wide data practices and policies."" This new office reflects the goals in the current strategic plan:  We will modernize and streamline the FCC's operations and programs to … reduce regulatory burdens…."
190,"The United States also maintains that using cluster munitions reduces the number of aircraft and artillery systems needed to support military operations, and that if cluster munitions were eliminated, significantly more money would need to be spent on new weapons systems, ammunition, and logistical resources.
2008 Department of Defense (DOD) Policy on Cluster Munitions25 The Barack Obama Administration announced on November 25, 2011, that the United States would continue to implement the DOD policy on cluster munitions issued June 19, 2008, which recognized the need to minimize harm to civilians and infrastructure but also reaffirmed that ""cluster munitions are legitimate weapons with clear military utility."" The central directive in the Pentagon's policy was the unwaiverable requirement that cluster munitions used after 2018 must leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield.
Furthermore, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate, and these munitions will be removed only after new munitions that meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard are fielded in sufficient quantities to meet combatant commander requirements."
191,"Background and Historical Context The United States has cultivated intelligence liaison relations with foreign partners through (1) the exchange of information, raw data, or finished intelligence; (2) basing rights for conducting intelligence operations, or privileges to host technical intelligence equipment; (3) burden sharing in the collection and reporting on issues of mutual interest; (4) joint covert action, collection, or exploitation operations; and (5) training.
U.S. IC relationships with foreign intelligence partners have developed in parallel with global IC coverage, as well as the growing number of interests the U.S. shares with foreign partners; it is also generally recognized that intelligence partnerships can provide mutual benefits for national security.
U.S. intelligence exchange relationships with foreign partners, therefore, often reflect the high level of trust and professional confidence the U.S. IC places in partnerships with particular foreign allies' intelligence services, involving a broad range of overlapping national security, political, and economic interests.
A fundamental assumption, supported by decades of experience, is that building and maintaining these partnerships enhances U.S. national security by providing some benefit that the U.S. would otherwise lack: access to otherwise inaccessible or hostile targets, corroboration of sources, cultural or linguistic expertise, the capacity to conduct joint assessments, providing indications and warning of an attack, obtaining basing rights, or jointly planning and conducting covert operations or intelligence collection.
Early Years The earliest efforts by the United States to formally cooperate with foreign partners in intelligence took place during World War I, when the British and French provided training, advice, and tactical intelligence exchanges with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) under General John Pershing.
The agreement provided for an expanded exchange of signals intelligence-related products and services concerning targets involving ""any country … excluding only the U.S., the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the British Empire."" Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were formally included as ""collaborating"" partners in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
These responsibilities are specified in Executive Order (EO) 12333, United States Intelligence Activities : CIA has the authority ""under the direction and guidance of the DNI … to coordinate the implementation of intelligence and counterintelligence relationships between elements of the IC and the intelligence or security services of foreign governments or international organizations."" This authority is reiterated in ICD-310, Coordination of Clandestine Human Source and Human-Enabled Foreign Intelligence Collection and Counterintelligence Activities o utside the United States .
Counterintelligence collected by a foreign intelligence partner (to support its own internal national security) and shared with the United States that includes information on U.S. persons requires special handling.
It was a warning that the CIA credited as ""altering the course of the Cold War."" In February 2006, GCHQ (the UK signals intelligence counterpart of the U.S. National Security Agency) shared with the United States information from intercepted communications between two Al Qa'ida operatives in Pakistan and the United Kingdom, respectively, indicating their plans to bomb civilian aircraft.
In its earliest years, the United States, as has been noted, benefited from the assistance of British and French mentors of the fledgling U.S. Military Intelligence Division (MID) during the First World War. Since the CIA's creation, training in intelligence collection and analysis has become a means by which the agency and other IC elements have established and maintained ties to foreign partners."
192,"The stated purposes of NVRA are to establish procedures to increase the number of eligible citizens registered to vote in federal elections; enable enhanced voter participation in federal elections; protect the integrity of the electoral process; and ensure accurate voter registration records.
UOCAVA also required states to accept and process any valid voter registration applications received at least 30 days prior to a federal election from military or overseas voters and created an official postcard form states would accept for these individuals containing both a voter registration application and an absentee ballot application.
Major Provisions of NVRA NVRA's shorthand name, the motor-voter bill, refers to one of its more well-known provisions—the requirement that states establish procedures for eligible individuals to register to vote in federal elections, or to update their voter registration records, simultaneously with their applications for motor vehicle driver's licenses or for any other form of personal identification provided by the state's department of motor vehicles (DMVs).
Maintenance and Updates to State Voter Lists As noted above, agencies providing voter registration forms, including DMVs, are required by NVRA to accept completed forms from applicants and transmit the forms to the appropriate state election official within 10 days of receipt.
The FEC was responsible for providing information to states about their responsibilities under NVRA; developing a mail-based federal voter registration form; and producing a biennial report to Congress, in consultation with states' chief election officers.
This section focuses only on the parts of HAVA that affected NVRA or voter registration in federal elections, namely, the computerization of state voter lists; changes to the federal mail-based voter registration form; and transferring the FEC's role to a newly created Election Assistance Commission (EAC).
Same-Day Voter Registration Nine bills introduced in the 115 th Congress would have required states to provide for same-day voter registration, which would enable a qualified individual to register to vote and cast a ballot simultaneously at a designated polling place.
This could cause some young voters who have moved to mistakenly believe they are eligible to vote in their new jurisdiction without updating their registration information, or create extra costs for state election officials as they seek to update these individuals' records and maintain accurate voter lists."
193,"Although the agreements rarely forced either side to accept significant changes in i ts planned nuclear forces, the arms control process, and the formal negotiations, were often one of the few channels for communication between the United States and Soviet Union.
In a speech in Prague in April 2009, the President outlined an agenda that included the pursuit of a new strategic arms control treaty with Russia, efforts to secure the ratification and entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the eventual negotiation of a Fissile Material Control Treaty.
The United States and Russia signed the 2010 New START Treaty, and have completed the implementation of its modest reductions, but there was little evidence of progress toward discussions on further reductions on nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, in 2015, the United States, Russia, and other nations reached an agreement with Iran that restricted Iran's nuclear program and introduced new, extensive international monitoring mechanisms to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.
Moreover, while some would argue that growing tensions between the United States and Russia strengthen the case for further negotiated limits on U.S. and Russian forces, the Trump Administration, and the Obama Administration in its later years, notes that Russia is not, at this time, willing to pursue such agreements.
In response to these views, and after years of trying to convince Russia to return to compliance with the INF Treaty, the Trump Administration announced on February 1, 2019, that the United States was suspending its participation in INF and would withdraw on August 2, 2019, following the treaty-mandated six-month withdrawal period.
Because these arms control arrangements affect U.S. national security, military programs, force levels, and defense spending, Congress has shown a continuing interest in the implementation of existing agreements and the prospects for further negotiations.
However, the U.S. Senate's rejection of the CTBT, the Bush Administration's withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002, and the U.S. rejection of a verification protocol for the Biological Weapons Convention led many nations to question the U.S. commitment to the arms control process.
During the Bush Administration, the United States outlined new initiatives in nonproliferation policy that took a far less formal approach, with voluntary guidelines and voluntary participation replacing treaties and multilateral conventions.
And, where the Bush Administration focused its efforts on denying these weapons to specific nations or groups who might threaten the United States, the Obama Administration adopted the more general goals of establishing and supporting international norms and regimes to control these weapons, regardless of which nations might seek them.
For example, in a speech in Moscow in July 2009, President Obama noted that ""the notion that prestige comes from holding these weapons, or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have these weapons, is an illusion."" He went on to state that stopping the spread of nuclear weapons ""is not about singling out individual nations—it's about the responsibilities of all nations."" The Trump Administration has offered some support for existing arms control and nonproliferation tools; it noted, in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, that the United States continues to support the goals of the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and that it would continue to abide by the terms of the 2010 New START Treaty, although it had not decided whether to extend it past 2021.
The first describes arms control efforts between the United States and the states of the former Soviet Union, covering both formal, bilateral treaties, and the cooperative threat reduction process.
These provide a list of treaties and agreements that the United States is a party to, a description of the treaty ratification process, and a list of the bilateral and international organizations tasked with implementation of arms control efforts.
Arms Control Between the United States and States of the Former Soviet Union The Early Years: SALT I and SALT II The United States and Soviet Union signed their first formal agreements limiting nuclear offensive and defensive weapons in May 1972.
When approving the agreement, Congress adopted a provision, known as the Jackson amendment, that mandated that all future arms control agreements would have to contain equal limits for the United States and Soviet Union.
Some analysts argued that the Treaty would fail to curb the arms race because the limits on forces were equal to the numbers already deployed by the United States and Soviet Union; they argued for lower limits and actual reductions.
Other analysts argued that the Treaty would allow the Soviet Union to maintain strategic superiority over the United States because the Soviet force of large, land-based ballistic missiles would be able to carry far greater numbers of warheads, even within the equal limits on delivery vehicles, than U.S. ballistic missiles.
W. Bush continued to pursue the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), with the United States and Soviet Union, signing this Treaty in July 1991.
The United States and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) on December 8, 1987.
During the Obama Administration, the United States grew concerned about Russia's testing and development of a new ground-launched cruise missile of INF range.
This report has stated that the United States has determined that ""the Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the [1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces] INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles."" In the 2018 version of the report, it identified the missile's designation as the 9M729.
The United States and Soviet Union signed the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) on July 31, 1991.
In early 1994, after the United States, Russia, and Ukraine agreed that Ukraine should receive compensation and security assurances in exchange for the weapons based on its soil, the parliament removed the conditions from its resolution of ratification.
The Bush Administration rejected that approach; it noted that the new Moscow Treaty (described below) called for further reductions in offensive nuclear weapons and it argued that many of the detailed provisions in START were no longer needed because the United States and Russia were no longer enemies.
These changes would have brought Russian forces below the 3,500 limit because so many of Russia's warheads are deployed on MIRVed ICBMs. As a result, many Russian officials and Duma members insisted that the United States and Russia negotiate a START III Treaty, with lower warhead numbers, so that Russia would not have to produce hundreds of new missiles to maintain START II levels.
The United States sought to address the Duma's concerns during 1997, by negotiating a Protocol that would extend the elimination deadlines in START II, and, therefore, reduce the annual costs of implementation, and by agreeing to negotiate a START III Treaty after START II entered into force.
The Clinton and Bush Years: Moving Past START and the ABM Treaty The arms control process between the United States and Russia essentially stalled during the 1990s, as efforts to ratify and implement START II dragged on.
He signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (known as the Moscow Treaty) in 2002, even though he would have preferred that the United States and Russia each set their force levels without any formal limits.
The Department of Defense concluded that there was no military requirement for the deployment of such a system after intelligence estimates found that no additional nations (beyond China, Russia, France, and Great Britain) were likely to develop missiles that could threaten the continental United States for at least the next 10-15 years.
In 1985, the United States proposed, in negotiations with the Soviet Union, that the two sides replace the ABM Treaty with an agreement that would permit deployment of more extensive defenses.
In February 1999, the United States and Russia began to discuss ABM Treaty modifications that would permit deployment of a U.S. national missile defense (NMD) system.
President Putin indicated that Russia wanted to use the formal arms control process, emphasizing that the two sides should focus on ""reaching a reliable and verifiable agreement."" Russia sought a ""legally binding document"" that would provide ""predictability and transparency"" and ensure for the ""irreversibilty of the reduction of nuclear forces."" The United States wanted to maintain the flexibility to size and structure its nuclear forces in response to its own needs.
The Bush Administration noted that the United States and Russia already collected information about strategic nuclear forces under START I and during implementation of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.
During hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Powell both agreed that the disposition of nonstrategic nuclear weapons should be on the agenda for future meetings between the United States and Russia, although neither supported a formal arms control regime to limit or contain these weapons.
The United States initially did not want to negotiate a new treaty, but, under the Bush Administration, would have been willing to extend, informally, some of START's monitoring provisions.
First, the original START Treaty contained several sublimits on warheads attributed to different types of strategic weapons, in part because the United States wanted the treaty to impose specific limits on elements of the Soviet force that were deemed to be ""destabilizing."" New START, in contrast, contains only a single limit on the aggregate number of deployed warheads.
Russia indicated that it might exercise its right to withdraw from the treaty if the United States increased the capabilities of its missile defenses ""in such a way that threatens the potential of the strategic nuclear forces of the Russian Federation.
Although Russia has said it may withdraw from the treaty if the U.S. missile defenses threaten ""the potential of the strategic nuclear forces of the Russian Federation,"" the United States has no obligation to consult with Russia to confirm that its planned defenses do not cross this threshold.
Moreover, an increasing proportion of CTR funding has been allocated to projects outside the former Soviet Union, as the United States seeks to engage a greater number of nations as partners in the effort to secure vulnerable nuclear materials and other weapons of mass destruction.
CTR Program Areas The United States has provided Russia and the other former Soviet states with extensive assistance with projects designed to help with the elimination of nuclear, chemical, and other weapons and their delivery vehicles.
These projects helped Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan remove warheads, deactivate missiles, and eliminate launch facilities for nuclear weapons covered by the START Treaty.
Since then, the United States and Russia have cooperated, through several programs, to secure and eliminate many of the materials that could help terrorists or rogue nations acquire their own nuclear capabilities.
Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting When the United States began to provide Russia with assistance securing its nuclear weapons and materials in the mid-1990s, concerns about the safety and security of nuclear materials located at civilian research facilities were paramount.
The State Department's Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) program helps the former Soviet states and other nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and their ability to stop the illicit trafficking of all materials for weapons of mass destruction, along with dual-use goods and technologies.
Multilateral Nuclear Nonproliferation Activities The International Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime The United States is a leader of an international regime that attempts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons through treaties, export control coordination and enforcement, and U.N. Security Council resolutions.
The Obama Administration has also said it would work with parties to the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone and the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone to resolve outstanding issues related to the protocols in order to ""sign the protocols to those treaties as soon as possible."" In August 2011, the United States along with the other four NPT nuclear weapon states began consultations with the SEANWFZ countries regarding the NWS protocols to that agreement.
Under DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, the United States and other partner countries provided Russia with considerable financial assistance for chemical weapons destruction.
The treaty obligates states parties engaged in the international arms trade to establish national control systems to review, authorize, and document the import, export, brokerage, transit, and transshipment of conventional weapons, their parts, and ammunition.
Over 100 nations signed the Ottawa Treaty, formally titled the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which entered into force for its parties on March 1, 1999.
Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (Moscow Treaty), 2002: Obligates the United States and Russia to reduce strategic nuclear forces to between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads.
Treaty … On Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START), 2010: Obligates the United States and Russia to reduce strategic nuclear forces to 1,550 warheads on up to 700 deployed delivery vehicles, within a total of 800 deployed and nondeployed delivery vehicles."
194,"Table 1 reveals that most of the discrepancy between the trade data from the two nations stems from significantly different figures for China's exports to the United States.
The top five HS chapters—footwear (64), machinery (84), electrical machinery (85), optical and medical instruments (90), and toys and sporting goods (95)—account for more than 94% of the difference between the U.S. and Chinese figures for U.S. imports from China (or Chinese exports to the United States).
Under the auspices of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), China's Ministry of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Commerce and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) have conducted two studies to determine the causes of the statistical discrepancies in the official merchandise trade data reported by both nations.
Roughly half of the ""eastbound trade"" data discrepancy can be attributed to goods that ""leave China, enter the commerce of intermediate countries or regions, and then [are] re-exported to the United States.""  Implications for Congress The release of the official U.S. annual trade figures has been frequently followed by expressions of concern about the size of U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China."
195,"P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) ($4.0 billion was issued) to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses; $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs; numerous changes to the SBA's loan guaranty and contracting programs; funding to continue the fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010; and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses (see Table A-1 in the Appendix for a list of its key provisions).
The end result is that the agency helped put more than $42 billion in the hands of small businesses through the Recovery Act and Jobs Act combined."" During the 112 th Congress, several bills were introduced to enhance small business access to capital through the SBA, including bills to extend the SBA's temporary fee subsidies and increase the 7(a) program's loan guaranty percentage to 90%.
During the 113 th Congress, P.L. 113-76 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, increased the SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) venture capital program's authorization amount to $4 billion from $3 billion as a means to provide small businesses additional access to venture capital.
provided $255 million for a temporary, two-year small business stabilization program to guarantee loans of $35,000 or less to small businesses for qualified debt consolidation, later named the America's Recovery Capital (ARC) Loan program (the program ceased issuing new loan guarantees on September 30, 2010); $15 million for the SBA's surety bond program, and temporarily increased the maximum bond amount from $2 million to $5 million, and up to $10 million under certain conditions (the higher maximum bond amounts ended on September 30, 2010); $6 million for the SBA's Microloan program's lending program and $24 million for the Microloan program's technical assistance program; and increased the funds (""leverage"") available to SBA-licensed Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) to no more than 300% of the company's private capital or $150,000,000, whichever is less.
Recent Laws Designed to Enhance the Demand for Small Business Loans ARRA provided the SBA $375 million to subsidize fees for the SBA's 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs and to increase the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage from up to 85% of loans of $150,000 or less and up to 75% of loans exceeding $150,000 to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans through September 30, 2010, or when appropriated funding for the subsidies and loan modification was exhausted.
P.L. 111-150 , an act to extend the Small Business Loan Guarantee Program, and for other purposes, provided the SBA authority to reprogram $40 million in previously appropriated funds to continue the fee subsides and 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through April 30, 2010.
Some advocates of providing additional resources to the SBA have argued that the federal government should enhance small business access to capital by creating a SBA direct lending program for small businesses.
Also, H.R. 5835 , the Veterans Access to Capital Act of 2012, introduced on May 18, 2012, and referred to the House Committee on Small Business, would have authorized the SBA to provide up to 20% of the annual amount available for guaranteed loans under the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs, respectively, in direct loans to veteran-owned and -controlled small businesses."
196,"First enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, and subsequently incorporated into the 2015 DHS-DOL interim final rule on H-2B employment, this provision permits an employer with an approved H-2B petition to bring in the H-2B workers under that petition any time during the 120 days beginning on the employer's starting date of need.
For each of these years, provisions in year-end omnibus appropriations laws authorized DHS to make additional H-2B visas available beyond the statutory cap after consultation with DOL and ""upon the determination that the needs of American businesses cannot be satisfied"" with available U.S. workers.
Using the same language as the FY2017 and FY2018 provisions, the FY2019 provision authorizes DHS, after consultation with DOL and ""upon the determination that the needs of American businesses cannot be satisfied"" with available U.S. workers, to make additional H-2B visas available for FY2019 up to a maximum of ""the highest number of H–2B nonimmigrants who participated in the H–2B returning worker program in any fiscal year in which returning workers were exempt from such numerical limitation."" As discussed below, the DHS-DOL rule implementing this provision limits the additional visas to H-2B returning workers.
However, the agency determined that 64,716 was the most appropriate maximum number of additional H-2B visas authorized under the special FY2017 provision, this being ""the number of beneficiaries covered by H–2B returning worker petitions that were approved for FY 2007.""  The supplementary information to the rule included the following explanation for limiting the FY2017 numerical increase to 15,000: Most recently, in FY 2016, 18,090 returning workers were approved for H–2B petitions, despite Congress having reauthorized the returning worker program with more than three-quarters of the fiscal year remaining.
Under the FY2019 rule, an employer may request supplemental visas only for H-2B workers ""who have been issued an H–2B visa or otherwise granted H–2B status in Fiscal Years 2016, 2017, or 2018."" DHS offers the following rationale for limiting the additional visas to H-2B returning workers: Such workers (i.e., those who recently participated in the H–2B program) have previously obtained H– 2B visas and therefore been vetted by DOS, would have departed the United States after their authorized period of stay as generally required by the terms of their nonimmigrant admission, and therefore may obtain their new visas through DOS and begin work more expeditiously."
197,"The Good Friday Agreement set out a framework for devolved government—the transfer of specified powers over local governance from London to Belfast—and called for establishing a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee in which unionist and nationalist parties would share power.
The harder-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), despite its continued opposition to many parts of the Good Friday Agreement, won 20 seats; Sinn Fein, the associated political party of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), won 18; and a number of smaller parties claimed the rest of the Assembly seats.
It called for negotiations between November 2006 and March 2007 on forming a new devolved government; during this time, the DUP would agree to share power with Sinn Fein and Sinn Fein would agree to support the police service and join the Policing Board.
Recruitment for the future Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began in March 2001, but it was unclear whether the SDLP or Sinn Fein would support it or join the 19-member Policing Board, a new democratic oversight body.
Following the suspension of Northern Ireland's devolved institutions in October 2002, Sinn Fein asserted that its acceptance of the PSNI and the Policing Board hinged on a deal to revive the devolved government and the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to a restored Assembly and Executive.
A series of events over the past few years—including protests over the use of flags and emblems, a crisis over implementing welfare reform, a controversy over a past deal for republican ""on the runs,"" and the arrest of a Sinn Fein leader in connection with the murder of a former IRA member—have highlighted the fragility of community relations and periodically threatened the stability of the devolved government.
Some analysts suggest that the June 2017 UK general election, which resulted in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party losing its majority in the House of Commons and forming a minority government that relies on support from the DUP, has hardened the positions of the DUP and Sinn Fein and made reaching an agreement on a new devolved government more difficult.
In late 2017, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar appeared to support this idea, but also noted that reviving the intergovernmental conference should not be construed as ""joint rule."" Initiatives to Further the Peace Process Over the past few years, the Northern Ireland political parties and the British and Irish governments have made several attempts to resolve outstanding issues related to the peace process, reduce tensions between the unionist and nationalist communities, and promote reconciliation.
(The specifics of the Haass proposals are discussed below in "" Ongoing Challenges ."") The Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Problems During the summer of 2014, the devolved government was tested by financial pressures and disagreement over UK-wide welfare reforms (passed by the UK parliament in February 2013 but which Sinn Fein and the SDLP opposed implementing in Northern Ireland).
On December 23, 2014, the Northern Ireland political parties and the British and Irish governments announced that a broad, multifaceted agreement had been reached on financial and welfare reform; governing structures; and the contentious issues of parades, flags, and the past (see "" Ongoing Challenges "" for more information on these latter provisions).
As part of the resulting ""Stormont House Agreement,"" the five main political parties agreed to support welfare reform (with certain mitigating measures), balance the budget, address Northern Ireland's heavy economic reliance on the public sector, and reduce the number of Executive departments and Assembly members over the next few years to improve efficiency and cut costs.
Many Northern Ireland political leaders and human rights groups were dismayed that negotiators failed to reach final agreement on establishing new institutions to deal with the past, as called for in the Stormont House Agreement.
The December 2014 Stormont House Agreement essentially endorsed this idea and asserted that a new Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition would be set up, composed of 15 members (with 7 to be appointed by Northern Ireland's main political parties and 8 drawn from outside the government).
In the Stormont House Agreement, the parties agreed that responsibility for parades and related protests should, in principle, be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly and that new legislation should be introduced.
Among the measures, the accord established a new set of principles for members of the Executive and Assembly that commits them to work toward the disbandment of all paramilitary organizations and their structures, to challenge paramilitary attempts to control communities, and to take no instructions from such groups; an independent three-member panel tasked with recommending a strategy for disbanding paramilitary groups; a new, four-member international body to monitor paramilitary activity and to report annually on progress toward ending paramilitary activity; and a cross-border Joint Agency Task Force to bring together officials from the PSNI and UK and Irish police, intelligence, and tax agencies to tackle paramilitarism and organized crime throughout the island of Ireland.
In November 2017, the State Department spokesperson expressed regret at the impasse in discussions to restore Northern Ireland's power-sharing institutions, urged continued dialogue, and asserted that the United States remained ""ready to support efforts that ensure full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent follow-on cross-party agreements."" Many Members of Congress have actively supported the peace process for decades.
More recently, congressional hearings have focused on the peace process, policing reforms, human rights, and the status of public inquiries into several past murders in Northern Ireland in which collusion between the security forces and paramilitary groups is suspected; these murders have included the 1989 slaying of Belfast attorney Patrick Finucane and the 1997 killing of Raymond McCord, Jr. Some Members of Congress have urged the Trump Administration to name a special envoy for Northern Ireland to signal that the United States remains committed to the region, especially in light of the stalemate in reestablishing the devolved government."
198,"It is designed to increase small business' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracting, by guaranteeing bid, performance, payment, and specified ancillary bonds ""on contracts … for small and emerging contractors who cannot obtain bonding through regular commercial channels."" The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary.
This report opens with an examination of the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program's legislative origin and provides a historical summary of the major issues that have influenced the program's development, including  the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with a Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB program) that initially provided SBA-approved sureties a lower guarantee rate (not to exceed 70%) than those participating in the Prior Approval Program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed bonds to small businesses without the SBA's prior approval; P.L. 114-92 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the PSB program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses; and the decision to increase the program's bond limit.
The act amended Title IV of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-699, as amended) to provide the SBA authority to guarantee any surety against loss as the result of a breach of the terms of a bid bond, payment bond, or performance bond by a principal on any contract up to $500,000.
The act specified that (1) the principal of the bond is a small business, (2) the bond is required as a condition of bidding on the contract or serving as a prime contractor or subcontractor on the project, (3) the small business is not able to obtain such bond on reasonable terms and conditions without the guarantee, (4) the SBA determines that there is a reasonable expectation that the small business will perform the covenants and conditions of the contract, (5) the contact meets SBA requirements concerning the feasibility of the contract being completed successfully and at a reasonable cost, and (6) the bond's terms and conditions are reasonable in light of the risks involved and the extent of the surety's participation.
The SBA also was authorized to ""obligate the surety to pay the Administration such portions of the bond fee as the Administration determines to be reasonable in light of the relative risks and costs involved."" The program's sponsors argued in 1970 that ""there is widespread evidence that a significant number of construction contracting organizations find varying degrees of difficulty in obtaining surety bonds"" and that ""the major share of these organizations are small businesses, and many of them are headed by minority groups."" They argued that the Surety Bond Guarantee Program would ""facilitate the entry and advancement of small and minority contractors in the construction business."" At that time, witnesses at congressional hearings testified that surety bonds were not necessarily required for most private sector construction contracts, but they were required for most public sector construction contracts.
During the 111 th Congress, P.L. 111-5 provided the Revolving Fund a separate appropriation of $15 million to support a temporary increase in the program's bond limit to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certified in writing that a guarantee in excess of $5 million was necessary, from $2 million.
One possible contributing factor to the decline in SBA-guaranteed surety bonds during that period was the continuing reluctance of many surety companies to participate in the program, either because they did not view the program as particularly profitable or they ""had developed alternative methods to the program, such as requiring collateral or funds controls and underwriting programs based in part on credit scores, in order to write small and emerging contractors."" Another possible contributing factor was a change in the way the program was perceived by congressional leaders and their reluctance to provide additional resources to continue the program's expansion.
For example, in 1982, the chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business indicted that the program was subject to ""the most insidious types of fraud,"" including ""evidence of involvement of organized crime figures."" In addition, reports by both GAO and the SBA's inspector general questioned the SBA's management of the program, arguing, among other things, that the SBA lacked useful underwriting guidelines for surety companies and adequate procedures for verifying applicants' information.
Small Business Eligibility Standards and Program Requirements The SBA is authorized to guarantee surety bonds issued to contractors or subcontractors when  the business, together with its affiliates, meets the SBA's size standard for the primary industry in which it is engaged; the bond is required; the applicant is not able to obtain such bond on reasonable terms and conditions without a guarantee; and there is a reasonable expectation that the applicant will perform the covenants and conditions of the contract, and the terms and conditions of the bond are reasonable in light of the risks involved and the extent of the surety's participation.
The Administration argued that raising the program's bond limit ""will make it easier for small businesses to take advantage of contracting opportunities generated by the American Jobs Act's proposed infrastructure investments."" On December 7, 2012, the Administration also recommended, as part of its request for an additional $60.4 billion in federal resources to address damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, that the SBA surety bond limit be increased to $5 million to enable ""more small businesses to participate in the recovery efforts."" There were several legislative efforts during the 112 th Congress to increase the program's bond limit."
199,"This report also provides total available funding (which includes carryover from the prior fiscal year, carryover into the next fiscal year, account transfers, rescissions, and sequestration) and, for comparative purposes, actual and anticipated expenditures for the SBA's entrepreneurial development noncredit programs.
SBA appropriations, as a whole, have varied significantly from year to year since FY2000 and across all three major SBA spending categories: appropriations for disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and ""other programs,"" a spending category that includes appropriations for salaries and expenses, business loan administration, the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Advocacy, and entrepreneurial development noncredit programs.
SBA Funding Within the Other Programs Category The following section examines appropriations and total available funding for FY2000-FY2019 for the five main components of the SBA's other programs spending category: (1) salaries and expenses, (2) business loan administration, (3) the Office of Inspector General (OIG), (4) the Office of Advocacy (Advocacy), and (5) entrepreneurial development (ED) noncredit programs.
As evidenced by the amounts listed in the total available funds column in the table, the SBA exercised that authority in every fiscal year from FY2000 to FY2018 (and is expected to do so again in FY2019), transferring the entire appropriation for business loan administration into the salaries and expenses account in each of those fiscal years.
As mentioned previously, prior to FY2012, the SBA reported Advocacy's total program cost, which includes funding provided through the salaries and expenses' executive direction subaccount, agency-wide overhead costs (rent, telecommunications, etc.), and other support costs (e.g., management and administrative support, including human resources support).
SCORE's 320 chapters and more than 800 branch offices are located throughout the United States and partner with more than 11,000 volunteer counselors, who are working or retired business owners, executives and corporate leaders, to provide management and training assistance to small businesses ""at no charge or at very low cost."" As shown in Table 9 , SCORE's recommended appropriations have increased from $3.487 million in FY2000 to $11.700 in FY2019."

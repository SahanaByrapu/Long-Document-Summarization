# Long-Document Summarization

Implemented an ensemble model for generating a summary for long-form documents(GOVEREPORT Dataset) and incorporated the encoder-decoder attention mechanism HEPOS (Head wise Positional Strides) of (Huang, 2021) along with Roberta, Pegasus, TextRank to attain better summarization and estimated ROUGE scores of the individual and ensemble models to evaluate the performance.Implemented an ensemble model for generating a summary for long-form documents and incorporated the encoder-decoder attention mechanism HEPOS (Head wise Positional Strides) of (Huang, 2021) along with Roberta, Pegasus, TextRank to attain better summarization and estimated ROUGE scores of the individual and ensemble models to evaluate the performance.
